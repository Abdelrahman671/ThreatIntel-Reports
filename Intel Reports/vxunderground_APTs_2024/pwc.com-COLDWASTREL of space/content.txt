COLDWASTREL of space
By John Southworth, PwC Threat Intelligence
Further infrastructure analysed for COLDWASTREL/White Dev 185 campaigns targeting NGOs.
On 14th August 2024, The Citizen Lab and AccessNow released reports on two threat actors:
COLDRIVER (which we track as Blue Callisto) and COLDWASTREL (which we track as White Dev
185).1 2 PwC was referenced for previous work on Blue Callisto,3 but we focus our analysis on White Dev
185 in this blog.
Through analysing the infrastructure that The Citizen Lab and AccessNow attribute to COLDWASTREL,
we observed the following default webpage response (with SHA-256:
fe563fa9ba8a8a70ef622a403228404910fdf4dd06ab3f154ec5009e5edb5e98) used on domains, for
example on account[.]protondrive[.]online.
Looking for further infrastructure returning this response, we observed 24 unique domains used between
2021 and 2024 which we assess are highly likely related to White Dev 185:
accounts-proton[.]me
center-facebook[.]com
desktop-facebook[.]com
drive-proton[.]com
email-pm[.]me
link-pm[.]me

security-gm[.]com
service-pm[.]me
service-proton[.]com
service-proton[.]me
services-proton[.]me
support-gm[.]com
support-ukr[.]net
verify-proton[.]me
Approximately half of these domains use ‘Proton’ as a theme, but other themes such as Facebook or
generic cloud/email services are also used, as well as abbreviated references to particular countries (i.e.
'support-ukr[.]net' is likely referencing Ukraine).
Based on the observed domains, we performed pDNS pivots to also link the following IP addresses to

We note that not all of these IP addresses are likely controlled by White Dev 185 any longer, but include
them as IoCs for historical hunting purposes. We also note several patterns of preferred hosting
providers, mainly favouring ‘EstNOC OY’ from 2022 onwards, and that the infrastructure used also
pushes back White Dev 185/COLDWASTREL’s initial activity to 2020.
Based on these IP addresses, we performed some further pDNS pivots for other infrastructure in the
respective timeframes for each IP. We include all infrastructure results as indicators at the end of the
blog.
Further threat actor links
Based on the use of the domain support-ukr[.]net, and the general approach of the campaigns (using
spear phishing with PDF attachments for credential stealing), we assess with realistic probability that the
campaigns CERT-UA track under the name UAC-0102 are related to White Dev 185.4
Further, based on this domain support-ukr[.]net, we observed that it resolved to 185.106.123[.]111 in
2021. This IP address also had the following domain resolutions in the same timeframe:
mail-ukr[.]net
email-ukr[.]net
The domain mail-ukr[.]net had been attributed by Microsoft in 2015 to what it previously called
STRONTIUM,5 now tracked as Forest Blizzard (a.k.a. APT28, BlueDelta, Fancy Bear), which we track as
Blue Athena. We also previously attributed email-ukr[.]net to Blue Athena in 2016.
Given the time difference between the initial use of these domains (2015/16) and them beginning to
resolve again in 2021 along with differences in WHOIS registration information between the two time
periods, we treat this as a low confidence pivot, as it could also be explained by the domain being reused
4/7
by a separate threat actor six years later. The IP address that both domains resolved to
(185.106.123[.]111) fits the pattern of being highly likely White Dev 185 (given hosting provider ‘Host
Sailor Ltd’, which has been used previously by the threat actor, and having previously been resolved to
by support-ukr[.]net), so we assess it is unlikely that this is some kind of sinkhole. As such, the two main
hypotheses we assess are possible are:
mail-ukr[.]net and email-ukr[.]net were previously both used by Blue Athena in 2015/16, and then
reused by a separate threat actor (White Dev 185) in 2021; or
White Dev 185 is Blue Athena.
Given this single attribution point, we do not have enough evidence at this stage to rule out either
hypothesis. As such, for now, we assess that White Dev 185 is related to Blue Athena with a realistic
probability, with low confidence.
