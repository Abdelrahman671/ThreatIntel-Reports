Bahamut
Bahamut is an advanced threat group targeting the Middle East and South
Asia. It was disclosed and named by Bellingcat in 2017. Later, BlackBerry
conducted a detailed and comprehensive analysis of the group and believed that
the group was a cyberattack mercenary. The Bahamut group mainly uses phishing
websites, fake news websites, and social networking sites to attack.
Recently, we observed a suspected mobile terminal attack activity of this
group. This attack activity started in January and used phishing websites to
deliver mobile RAT samples. The RAT used in the attack belongs to a new family
that has not been disclosed, and we speculate that it belongs to the group's
unique attack weapon.
1. Payload Delivery
We monitored that the organization used its usual attack method - phishing website to
deliver payloads. The phishing website pretends to be the introduction page of the secure chat
software and provides a download link for the Android software. Through the domain name and
certificate information of the phishing website, it can be known that the attack started in early
January 2022 and is still active today .

2. Sample Analysis
The basic information of the sample is as follows:
MD5
file name
Package names
ed43605e6d85c7eab473c30ec
1b2271a
securechatnow_v1_0_7.apk
com.example.chatapplication
The samples used in this attack are chat software with remote control function, and the chat
function and remote control function are developed separately. The server address of the chat
function and the C&C of the remote control function use the same address. In view of the same
C&C address used for chat and remote control, and we have not found open source or open
source code similar to this chat function and remote control function in the wild, we guess that
this sample is an independently developed attack weapon. So far, the sample has not been
identified by other security vendors.

of 
the 
sample 
is 
mainly 
in 
the
com.example.chatapplication.monitoring package . The malicious code is highly modularized
and written with high quality, and uses a database to store various information. In addition to
stealing common user privacy information such as text messages, contacts, and call records, it
also uses auxiliary functions to focus on stealing chat information from a large number of well-
known social software.

3. Traceability and attribution
According to the signature information of the samples from the same family, we have
associated a sample suspected to belong to the B ahamut organization. The C & C format of the
suspected sample is very similar to that of the sample analyzed this time. Both use random
combination strings of numbers and letters. There is a URL with the same path ( /auth/login )
that shows the same login page . And among the samples of the same family of the suspected
sample, there are two samples whose download address is jamaat-ul-islam.com, and the
download address was disclosed by Blackbarry in 2020 and belongs to the Bahamut organization.
Therefore, we attribute the attack samples discovered this time to the Bahamut group.

4. Attack activity and victim analysis
By analyzing the creation time of the family sample and tracing the source of the sample, we
found that the family sample first appeared in October 2020, and remained calm after a brief
activity in February 2021, until it became active again in January this year , and is still active
today. In the two active periods, different phishing websites were used for payload delivery.
Figure 8 Active timeline of samples from the same family

By querying the user infection status of the early samples of the same family, we found that
the earliest infection time of the victim user was at the end of February 2021, which is consistent
with the appearance time of phishing websites during the first active period. The geographical
locations are mainly concentrated in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. They are also consistent with the
main target of the Bahamut group.

The ability to independently develop chat software and remote control
Trojans, with clear code structure and high quality, shows that Bahamut's
developers have a high level of development. At the same time, the development
of Trojanized chat software, the use of random strings as C &C , and frequent
phishing also show that the organization has strong camouflage and attack skills.
During our follow-up of the Bahamut attack, several other family samples
belonging to the group appeared, which shows that the group should have
concentrated attack activities in the near future. We will continue to monitor the
group's attack dynamics.
