*Updated 2024-04-25 16:57 GMT with minor wording corrections regarding the targeting of other vendors.
ArcaneDoor is a campaign that is the latest example of state-sponsored actors targeting perimeter network devices
from multiple vendors. Coveted by these actors, perimeter network devices are the perfect intrusion point for
espionage-focused campaigns. As a critical path for data into and out of the network, these devices need to be
routinely and promptly patched; using up-to-date hardware and software versions and configurations; and be closely
monitored from a security perspective. Gaining a foothold on these devices allows an actor to directly pivot into an
organization, reroute or modify traffic and monitor network communications. In the past two years, we have seen a
dramatic and sustained increase in the targeting of these devices in areas such as telecommunications providers and
energy sector organizations — critical infrastructure entities that are likely strategic targets of interest for many foreign
governments.  
Cisco’s position as a leading global network infrastructure vendor gives Talos’ Intelligence and Interdiction team
immense visibility into the general state of network hygiene. This also gives us uniquely positioned investigative
capability into attacks of this nature. Early in 2024, a vigilant customer reached out to both Cisco’s Product Security
Incident Response Team (PSIRT) and Cisco Talos to discuss security concerns with their Cisco Adaptive Security
Appliances (ASA). PSIRT and Talos came together to launch an investigation to assist the customer. During that
investigation, which eventually included several external intelligence partners and spanned several months, we
identified a previously unknown actor now tracked as UAT4356 by Talos and STORM-1849 by the Microsoft Threat
Intelligence Center. This actor utilized bespoke tooling that demonstrated a clear focus on espionage and an in-depth
knowledge of the devices that they targeted, hallmarks of a sophisticated state-sponsored actor. 
UAT4356 deployed two backdoors as components of this campaign, “Line Runner” and “Line Dancer,” which were
used collectively to conduct malicious actions on-target, which included configuration modification, reconnaissance,
network traffic capture/exfiltration and potentially lateral movement.  
Critical Fixes Available 
Working with victims and intelligence partners, Cisco uncovered a sophisticated attack chain that was used to implant
custom malware and execute commands across a small set of customers. While we have been unable to identify the
initial attack vector, we have identified two vulnerabilities (CVE-2024-20353 and CVE-2024-20359), which we detail
below. Customers are strongly advised to follow the guidance published in the security advisories discussed below.  
Further, network telemetry and information from intelligence partners indicate the actor is interested in — and
potentially attacking — Microsoft Exchange servers and network devices from other vendors. Regardless of your
network equipment provider, now is the time to ensure that the devices are properly patched, logging to a central,
2/9
secure location, and are configured to have strong, multi-factor authentication (MFA). Additional recommendations
specific to Cisco are available here.  
Timeline 
Cisco was initially alerted to suspicious activity on an ASA device in early 2024. The investigation that followed
identified additional victims, all of which involved government networks globally. During the investigation, we identified
actor-controlled infrastructure dating back to early November 2023, with most activity taking place between
December 2023 and early January 2024. Further, we have identified evidence that suggests this capability was being
tested and developed as early as July 2023.   
Cisco has identified two vulnerabilities that were abused in this campaign (CVE-2024-20353 and CVE-2024-20359).
Patches for these vulnerabilities are detailed in the Cisco Security Advisories released today.
Initial Access 
We have not determined the initial access vector used in this campaign. We have not identified evidence of pre-
authentication exploitation to date. Our investigation is ongoing, and we will provide updates, if necessary, in the
security advisories or on this blog.
Line Dancer: In-Memory Implant Technical Details 
The malware implant has a couple of key components. The first is a memory-only implant, called “Line Dancer.” This
implant is a memory-resident shellcode interpreter that enables adversaries to upload and execute arbitrary shellcode
payloads.  
On a compromised ASA, the attackers submit shellcode via the host-scan-reply field, which is then parsed by the
Line Dancer implant. Note that the use of this field does not indicate the exploitation of CVE-2018-0101 which was
NOT used as a component of this campaign. The host-scan-reply field, typically used in later parts of the SSL VPN
session establishment process, is processed by ASA devices configured for SSL VPN, IPsec IKEv2 VPN with “client-
services" or HTTPS management access. The actor overrides the pointer to the default host-scan-reply code to
instead point to the Line Dancer shellcode interpreter. This allows the actor to use POST requests to interact with the
device without having to authenticate and interact directly through any traditional management interfaces. 
Line Dancer is used to execute commands on the compromised device. During our investigation, Talos was able to
observe the threat actors using the Line Dancer malware implant to: 
3/9
Disable syslog. 
Run and exfiltrate the command show configuration. 
Create and exfiltrate packet captures. 
Execute CLI commands present in shellcode; this includes configuration mode commands and the ability to
save them to memory (write mem). 
Hook the crash dump process, which forces the device to skip the crash dump generation and jump directly to
a device reboot. This is designed to evade forensic analysis, as the crash dump would contain evidence of
compromise and provide additional forensic details to investigators. 
Hook the AAA (Authentication, Authorization and Accounting) function to allow for a magic number
authentication capability. When the attacker attempts to connect to the device using this magic number, they
are able to establish a remote access VPN tunnel bypassing the configured AAA mechanisms. As an alternate
form of access, a P12 blob is generated along with an associated certificate and exfiltrated to the actor along
with a certificate-based tunnel configuration.  
Host-Scan-Reply hook overview 
In the Line Dancer implant’s process memory, we found a function (detailed below) that checks if a 32-byte token
matches a pattern. If so, it base64-decodes the payload, copies it into the attacker's writable and executable memory
region, and then calls the newly decoded function. Either way, it ends by calling processHostScanReply(). 
The function processHostScanReply() is normally accessed through a function pointer in the elementArray
table, associated with the string host-scan-reply. In the captured memory, the entry that should point to
processHostScanReply()now instead points to the attacker's function that decodes and runs its payload. Since
this change is in the data section of memory, it doesn't show up in hashes/dumps of text. 
 The attacker function that decodes and runs its payload has the following decompilation: 
Line Runner: Persistence Mechanism 
The threat actor maintains persistence utilizing a second, but persistent, backdoor called “Line Runner” on the
compromised ASA device using functionality related to a legacy capability that allowed for the pre-loading of VPN
clients and plugins on the device. At boot, the ASA is designed to look for the presence of a file on disk0: matching
the Lua regular expression:
 ^client_bundle[%w_-]*%.zip$  
If the file exists, it will unzip it and execute the script csco_config.lua. Once processed, the ZIP file is deleted. This is
assigned CVE-2024-20359 and more details are available in this Cisco Security Advisory.  
In at least one case, there is another vulnerability, CVE-2024-20353, that was abused by the actor to facilitate this
process. The attackers were able to leverage this vulnerability to cause the target ASA device to reboot, triggering the
unzipping and installing the second component of the threat actor’s malware implant, Line Runner. 
The threat actor’s ZIP file has the following files: 
4/9
The scripts in the zip file allow the threat actor to maintain a persistent HTTP-based Lua backdoor to the ASA, which
survives across reboots and upgrades. Line Runner was observed being used by UAT4356 to retrieve information
that was staged through the use of Line Dancer.  
csco_config.lua 
The csco_config.lua file is run at boot and makes the following modifications to the system: 
 • Create disk0:/csco_config/97/webcontent/ if it doesn't already exist 

• Create disk0:/csco_config/97/webcontent/1515480F4B538B669648B17C02337098 from hash.txt 

• Append index.txt to disk0:/csco_config/97/webcontent/index_bp.ini and put the result in
disk0:/csco_config/97/webcontent/index.ini 

• Move the original client_bundle.zip file to /run/lock/subsys/krbkdc6

• Prepend umtfc.txt to /etc/init.d/umountfs 

• Copy stgvdr.txt to /asa/scripts/lina_cs 

• Backup /asa/scripts/lina_exe_cs.sh to /asa/scripts/lina_exe_cs_bp.sh 

• Replace /asa/scripts/lina_exe_cs.sh with laecsnw.txt 

• Copy csco_config2.lua over csco_config.lua 

• Disable the importPlugin function for the next call only  
csco_config2.lua 
The csco_config2.lua file cleans up the modifications made by csco_config.lua (above) and removes itself. 
hash.txt 
Used as content for disk0:/csco_config/97/webcontent/1515480F4B538B669648B17C02337098. 
Intercepts HTTP requests to the ASA. The threat actor’s code looks for an HTTP request with a set of 32-character
parameters that are victim-dependent. If they match, then the payload contained within one of these parameters is
written to a Lua script and executed. This is the backdoor’s command and control mechanism. 
index.txt 
Adds webContent information so hash.txt is processed. 
laecsnw.txt 
Temporarily replaces /asa/scripts/lina_exe_cs.sh. 
Executes /asa/scripts/lina_cs as a background process (see below). Removes itself. Then restore the backup
/asa/scripts/lina_exe_cs_bp.sh.  
stgvdr.txt 
Runs as /asa/scripts/lina_cs. 
After sleeping for 30 seconds, sets expected owner and times on /etc/init.d/umountfs. Removes the hash API
endpoint, the index.ini, and either restores the backup index.ini or removes the webcontent directory entirely. Finally,
removes itself.  
umtfc.txt
Prepended to /etc/init.d/unmountfs. 
The unmountfs script is called at shutdown to unmount the filesystems. The threat actor’s modifications perform the
following functionality: 
5/9
• If disk0:/csco_config/97/webcontent/1515480F4B538B669648B17C02337098 exists, it removes it and
index.ini. 

• Copy /run/lock/subsys/krbkdc6 to disk0:client_bundle_install.zip
This sets up the zipfile to be executed at the next boot, maintaining persistence. 
Forensic Recovery and Identification of Line Runner 
To identify the presence of Line Runner on an ASA, the following methods can be used. Note also that the device
should be upgraded to a fixed version as identified in the first method. 
Method 1: 
After updating the device to a software release that contains the fix for CVE-2024-20359, a review of the contents of
disk0: should be conducted. If a new file (e.g., “client_bundle_install.zip” or any other unusual .zip file) appears on
disk0: following the update, this suggests that Line Runner was present on the device in question. Note that
because the updated software is not vulnerable to CVE-2024-20359, Line Runner will no longer be active on the
device. 
Method 2: 
To detect (and remove) Line Runner, the following series of commands will create an innocuous file with a .zip
extension. Note that it will not create a valid zip file, but the file will still be read by the ASA at reboot. Upon execution
of the following commands, if a new .zip file appears on disk0: following the reload, this suggests that Line Runner
was present on the device in question. Deletion of the “client_bundle_install.zip” file will remove Line Runner. Note
that the malicious ZIP containing the Line Runner functionality could have other names that fit the naming pattern
outlined previously.  
If you discover a newly created .zip file, copy that file off the device using the copy command and contact
psirt@cisco.com referencing CVE-2024-20359. Include the outputs of the dir disk0: and show version commands
from the device and the .zip file extracted from the device. 
Anti-Forensics/Anti-Analysis Capabilities 
UAT4356 took clear and deliberate steps to attempt to prevent forensic capture of malicious artifacts. This tradecraft
suggests a thorough understanding of the ASA itself and of the forensic actions commonly performed by Cisco for
network device integrity validation. Additional steps were taken on a case-by-case basis to hide actions being taken
on the device. These steps included hooking the AAA (Authentication, Authorization and Accounting) function of the
device to allow the actor to bypass normal AAA operations. We also identified some instances where UAT4356
disabled logging to perform operations on or from the ASA and not have those operations or actions logged.  
Line Dancer appears to have been intentionally placed into a difficult-to-reach region of memory. In addition, it hooks
into functions such as the core dump function, which is commonly used to collect information for debugging and
forensic purposes, which were made in memory such that this function simply jumped to a reboot. This means that on
reboot, Line Dancer itself would no longer be present and none of the collections present in the core dump function
would have been executed, all resulting in a complete loss of debug information and memory-based forensic
artifacts. 
Attribution  
As a part of our ongoing investigation, we have also conducted analysis on possible attribution of this activity. Our
attribution assessment is based on the victimology, the significant level of tradecraft employed in terms of capability
development and anti-forensic measures, and the identification and subsequent chaining together of 0-day
vulnerabilities. For these reasons, we assess with high confidence that these actions were performed by a state-
sponsored actor.
Recommendations 
6/9
There are some known indicators of compromise that customers can look for if they suspect they may have been
targeted in this campaign. First, organizations should look for any flows to/from ASA devices to any of the IP
addresses present in the IOC list provided at the bottom of this blog. This is one indication that further investigation is
necessary. 
Additionally, organizations can issue the command show memory region | include lina to identify another
indicator of compromise. If the output indicates more than one executable memory region (memory regions having r-
xp permissions, see output examples), especially if one of these memory sections is exactly 0x1000 bytes, then this
is a sign of potential tampering.   
Output of the ‘show memory region’ command for a compromised device (top) vs. a clean device (bottom).
Note that the earlier provided steps to identify the presence of Line Runner can still be followed even in the absence
of more than one executable memory region as we have seen cases where Line Runner was present without Line
Dancer being present. We still recommend following the steps to upgrade to a patched version even if customers
believe that their device has not been compromised.  
Next, follow the steps detailed in the Cisco ASA Forensic Investigation Procedures for First Responders. When
following these procedures first responders should NOT attempt to collect a core dump (Step 5) or reboot
the device if they believe that the device has been compromised, based on the lina memory region output.
The previous steps up to and including a collection of the memory text section should be followed. In addition, we
have released some Snort signatures to detect the activity on the wire including access attempts. Signatures 63139,
62949, and 45575 have been released to detect the implants or associated behaviors. Please note that the device
must be set up to decrypt TLS for these signatures to be effective. 
CVE-2024-20353 (ASA DOS/Reboot) - 3:63139 
‘Line Runner’ – Persistence Mechanism Interaction – 3:62949 
‘Line Dancer’ – In-Memory Only Shellcode Interpreter Interaction – 3:45575 
Note that this signature was originally built to detect an unrelated CVE but it also detects Line Dancer
interaction 
If your organization does find connections to the provided actor IPs and the crash dump functionality has been
altered, please open a case with Cisco TAC.  
UAT4356 Infrastructure 
7/9
Key components of the actor-controlled infrastructure used for this operation had an interesting overlap of SSL
certificates which match the below pattern while also appearing as an ASA, during the same period, to external
scanning engines such as Shodan and Censys as reported by the CPE data on the same port as the noted SSL
certificate. The SSL certificate information suggests that the infrastructure is making use of an OpenConnect VPN
Server (https://ocserv.openconnect-vpn.net) through which the actor appeared to be conducting actions on target.

Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)  
There are several known indicators of compromise that defenders can look for when assessing whether their ASA
device has been compromised as a result of this attack, as outlined earlier in this post. For example, if any gaps in
logging or any recent unexpected reboots are observed, this should be treated as suspicious activity that warrants
further investigation. Also, below is a list of IP addresses we identified as having been used by UAT4356. Please note
that some of these IPs are part of publicly known anonymization infrastructure and not directly controlled by the
attackers themselves. If your organization does find connections to the provided actor IPs and the crash dump
functionality has been altered, please open a case with Cisco TAC.
