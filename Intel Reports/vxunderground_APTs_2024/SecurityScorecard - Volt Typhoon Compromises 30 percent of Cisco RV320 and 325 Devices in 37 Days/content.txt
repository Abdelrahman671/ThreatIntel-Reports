Cisco devices possibly affected by 
vulnerabilities publicly disclosed in 2019
Cyber Conflict and the Erosion of Trust    |     2
The SecurityScorecard Threat Research, Intelligence, Knowledge, and Engagement (STRIKE) Team has 
identified new infrastructure that appears to be linked to the threat actor group tracked as Volt Typhoon. 
•	 Volt Typhoon is a state-sponsored group based in China that typically focuses on espionage and 
information gathering.
Approximately 30% of the Cisco RV320/325 devices observed by SecurityScorecard in a 37-day 
period may have been compromised by Volt Typhoon. 
•	 The Cisco RV320/325 vulnerability was publicly disclosed in January 2019. 
•	 For RV320, there are 35 known vulnerabilities for the Dual Gigabit Wan VPN Router Firmware, 
all with a CVSS score of 9. 
•	 Two vulnerabilities from 2019 mentioned in the CISA KEV list (CVE-2019-1653, CVE-2019-
1652) could have been exploited by Volt Typhoon.
•	 SecurityScorecard research illustrates state-sponsored threat actor groups’ ongoing ability to 
identify vulnerable devices in anattempt to compromise targetnetworks.  
•	 The STRIKE Team observed frequent connections between these devices and known Volt 
Typhoon infrastructure from 12/1/23 to 1/7/2024, suggesting a very active presence.
•	 The devices are end-of-life, so Cisco has not released and will not release software updates to 
address vulnerabilities affecting them. 
SecurityScorecard researchers uncovered evidence of a previously unspecified webshell, fy.sh, on 
Cisco routers and other network edge devices targeted by the group. 
•	 China Chopper is probably the best-known web shell used by China-linked APT groups; 
SecurityScorecard has now observed evidence of another.
•	 The STRIKE Team observed possible targeting of U.S., U.K., and Australian government assets by 
two such devices. 
•	 Public reporting on Volt Typhoon has not previously noted its targeting of Australian or U.K. 
government assets in addition to U.S. ones.
Researchers identified two previously unidentified IP addresses belonging to a cluster of activity 
linked to Volt Typhoon, 45.63.60[.]39 and 45.32.174[.]131.
The file name and IP addresses the STRIKE Team discovered may offer further indications of Volt 
Typhoon’s preparation of new infrastructure, which other recent reports have also observed.

Following the publication of reports of new activity attributed to the threat actor group tracked as Volt 
Typhoon and Bronze Silhouette, which the cybersecurity community believes to conduct espionage 
on behalf of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), the STRIKE Team began to track and identify covert 
infrastructure linked to the campaign. The reports already published about the group note varying 
levels of complexity, but its use of compromised small office and home office (SOHO) equipment such 
as routers and firewalls to conduct attacks abroad is a recurring feature. This research is based on the 
infrastructure that SecurityScorecard’s global internet data and other passive signals collections identified.
Lumen’s Black Lotus Labs’ recently-published report identified a group of compromised SOHO devices 
appearing to constitute a botnet that threat actors including but not limited to Volt Typhoon have used 
to covertly transfer data. The compromised devices the botnet uses include Cisco and DrayTek routers, 
NETGEAR firewalls, and Axis IP cameras. STRIKE researchers used the indicators of compromise 
(IoCs) published alongside that report to conduct further research, which led to the newly-identified 
infrastructure discussed below.

Further research suggests that the Volt Typhoon-linked botnet’s compromise of Cisco RV320 
and RV325 routers may be more extensive than previously reported. Researchers additionally 
used a strategic partner’s network flow (NetFlow) data to develop additional insights into 
activity involving this population of possible target devices and found that approximately 
30% of them (325 of 1,116 devices) communicated with two IP addresses previously named 
as proxy routers used for command and control (C2) communications, 174.138.56[.]21 and 
159.203.113[.]25, in a thirty-day period. Communication with known botnet C2 infrastructure 
may suggest participation in that same botnet’s activities.

The continued activity by one of the aforementioned C2 proxies, 159.203.113[.]25, into early 
January, appears to reflect a shift in the botnet’s C2 infrastructure, which the dates provided 
by Black Lotus Labs may also reflect. Prior to mid-November, another DigitalOcean IP address 
named as an IoC linked to the same botnet, 159.203.72[.]166, appears to have been more 
active, but the increased activity from 159.203.113[.]25, another DigitalOcean IP address, from 
November 17 onward, suggests that the latter took the former’s place. A similar shift appears to 
have occurred in the botnet’s Vultr infrastructure as well, with activity involving 144.202.49[.]189 
increasing and activity involving 140.82.20[.]246 diminishing in mid-November.

Additionally, SecurityScorecard’s scan data has revealed a group of Cisco routers with 
metadata containing an IP address the Black Lotus Labs report cited above named as a 
payload server, which suggests compromise by Volt Typhoon or another threat actor using the 
same botnet. This metadata refers to a wget command featuring 45.11.92[.]176, a known Volt 
Typhoon IoC, and references a file, fy.sh, that the devices in question retrieve and execute 
from 45.11.92[.]176. However, as of January 8, 2024, the payload server is offline.
SecurityScorecard Threat Research: Volt Typhoon   |     8
Metadata for the following IP addresses indicates that they contact the payload server at the 
IP address listed among other new IoCs associated with Volt Typhoon. Given that they do not 
themselves appear in the previously published list, they may represent previously unidentified IoCs 
related to Volt Typhoon activity:
•	 46.10.197[.]206
•	 176.102.35[.]175
•	 93.62.0[.]77
•	 194.50.159[.]3
•	 80.64.80[.]169
•	 24.212.225[.]54
•	 208.97.106[.]10
•	 70.60.30[.]222
•	 184.67.141[.]110

Findings:

SecurityScorecard Threat Research: Volt Typhoon   |     9
Researchers additionally noted that the infrastructure observed communicating with 
45.11.92[.]176 features a webshell implant. This implant performs a wget request to the 
payload server to download a file named fy.sh.
Of the IoCs Lumen circulated, the two files identified by the SHA256 hashes 
7043ffd9ce3fe48c9fb948ae958a2e9966d29afe380d6b61d5efb826b70334f5 (the file 
named Kv-all.sh) and 36c63d0c2a78497ccf555e84f0233a514943faeff38281d99d00baf5df23f184 
are, as indicated by the .sh extension they have in common with fy.sh, shell files. A sample 
of the particular file named fy.sh that 45.11.92[.]176 served does not yet appear to be 
publicly available, but two files with that name have appeared in VirusTotal. These two files, 
however, appear to be unrelated to the recent campaign; vendors detect them as macOS 
adware and both were last seen in Summer 2021, while the activity discussed in Lumen’s 
report began in February 2022. The fy.sh served by 45.11.92[.]176 may therefore more likely 
correspond to a different file also named fy.sh, one which may be similar to either of the 
.sh files Lumen named as IoCs, both given that an IP address named as an IoC in the same 
report as those files has served fy.sh and that it is, in general, fairly common for PRC-linked 
APT groups to use webshells (the China Chopper webshell is perhaps the most famous 
example but by no means the only one).
Findings: 
Additional NetFlow 
Analysis
SecurityScorecard Threat Research: Volt Typhoon    |     10
Researchers conducted further analysis of NetFlow data to develop additional insights into 
activity that may be related to the campaign. The analysis below focuses on traffic involving 
the payload server discussed above, devices observed communicating with it, and other 
newly-identified compromised devices; communications between these compromised 
devices and other network devices may also offer insights into the campaign’s victimology. 
Researchers identified new IP addresses that belong to the Volt Typhoon-linked C2 
infrastructure Lumen termed the “JDY Cluster” on the basis of the recurrence of the same 
common name, “jdyfj,” in the SSL certificates observed at the IP addresses in this cluster. 
The two new IP addresses belonging to the cluster are 45.63.60[.]39 and 45.32.174[.]131.
To identify these IP addresses, researchers first used SecurityScorecard’s scan data to 
collect a group of IP addresses where products Volt Typhoon is known to compromise 
are in use and then leveraged a strategic partner’s network flow (NetFlow) data to 
collect traffic samples for those IP addresses. 202.22.227[.]179 is one such IP address; 
SecurityScorecard’s data indicates that a Cisco RV325 device is in use there and, according 
to the traffic samples for established Volt Typhoon-linked IoCs, it has communicated 
regularly IP addresses previously linked to Volt Typhoon.
SecurityScorecard’s Attack Surface Intelligence module indicates that 202.22.227[.]179 is 
located in Noumea, New Caledonia and belongs to Micro Logic Systems (mls[.]nc), a New 
Caledonian internet service provider (ISP). 
FIGURE 11: 
SecurityScorecard 
locates 
202.22.227[.]179 
in New Caledonia 
and attributes it to a 
New Caledonian ISP.
Its location and attribution to an ISP may further suggest 202.22.227[.]179’s use as a transit 
point for Volt Typhoon-related traffic; New Caledonia is an island chain in the Southwest Pacific, 
so it may be a common occurrence for traffic between the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region and the 
Americas to pass through New Caledonian communications infrastructure en route to a final 
destination either elsewhere in APAC or in the Americas. The available analysis of Volt Typhoon 
has highlighted its targeting of communications between APAC and the Americas – its intrusions 
into the networks of telecommunications providers and other critical infrastructure in Guam 
attracted particular attention in previous reporting–so its exploitation of telecommunications 
infrastructure on another Pacific island may be in keeping with this previous behavior. 
However, a separate traffic sample focused specifically on 202.22.227[.]179 indicated frequent 
communication between 202.22.227[.]179 and both 45.63.60[.]39 and 45.32.174[.]131. 
45.63.60[.]39 communicated with 202.22.227[.]179 3,097 times between December 28 and 31 
and 45.32.174[.]131 communicated with it 3,358 times over the same period. Both of these IP 
addresses belong to the same hosting provider as others previously identified as Volt Typhoon 
IoCs and both feature SSL certificates issued to jdyfj, the same subject that appeared in the 
SSL certificates at IP addresses Lumen previously named as part of the JDY cluster. Both 
45.63.60[.]39 and 45.32.174[.]131 are therefore likely previously unidentified parts of that cluster. 
SecurityScorecard Threat Research: Volt Typhoon   |     11
SecurityScorecard Threat Research: Volt Typhoon   |     12
Additional activity involving 45.63.60[.]39 may further reflect behavior associated with Volt 
Typhoon. It and 67.205.139[.]175, a Tor exit node, communicated twenty-five times between 
December 28 and December 30. Previous reports have noted that Volt Typhoon has used Tor 
for its C2 communications, so this traffic may reflect C2 communications between different 
Volt Typhoon-controlled resources (one routing traffic through Tor and the other hosted at 
45.63.60[.]39).
STRIKE Team researchers additionally observed four instances of communication between 
31.19.153[.]48, an IP address where SecurityScorecard’s data indicates another product 
Volt Typhoon has been observed exploiting, a DrayTek Vigor 2960 router, is in use and 
202.22.227[.]179 on November 18. Given that Volt Typhoon is known to compromise the 
specific DrayTek and Cisco devices in use at 31.19.153[.]48 and 202.22.227[.]179, that 
they were communicating with one another, and that 202.22.227[.]179 also communicated 
regularly with other Volt Typhoon-linked IP addresses, communications between these two IP 
addresses may also reflect Volt Typhoon activity, although it is not clear at present if the IP 
addresses represent infrastructure particular to Volt Typhoon. 
Researchers also collected and analyzed samples of traffic involving known Volt Typhoon 
infrastructure, given that the behavior originating IP addresses named as Volt Typhoon-related 
IoCs could offer additional insights into the group’s activity. This sample led researchers 
to other IP addresses that may represent additional, previously unidentified Volt Typhoon 
infrastructure. 144.202.49[.]189, an IP address Lumen identified as a proxy router for Volt 
Typhoon’s C2 communications, and 82.117.159[.]158, an IP address where SecurityScorecard’s 
data indicates a Cisco router is in use, communicated 68,164 times between December 1 and 
December 7. Given the frequency of its communication with a known Volt Typhoon asset, 
and the observation of a product Volt Typhoon has been observed exploiting in use at it, 
82.117.159[.]158 may represent an additional Volt Typhoon-linked IoC. 
FIGURE 12: 
Communications 
between some 
targeted Cisco 
models and 
Volt Typhoon 
infrastructure.
As with the findings discussed previously, these communications may suggest that the botnet 
linked to Volt Typhoon is more extensive than previously reported, as communications between 
known IoCs linked to it and devices it is known to exploit could suggest compromise (and 
subsequent malicious reuse) of those devices.
The payload server’s traffic sample, meanwhile, featured communication between it and 
fourteen IP addresses that appear to host routers and other devices like those listed in Lumen’s 
recent report on the botnet Volt Typhoon has used from November 9th to December 18th. The 
use of these devices and the IP addresses’ communication with the payload server, may, taken 
together, suggest that the following are the fourteen IP addresses also represent previously 
unpublished IoCs linked to the botnet identified by Lumen:
•	 192.149.47[.]110
•	 212.11.106[.]139
•	 89.203.140[.]246
•	 94.125.218[.]19
•	 183.82.110[.]178
•	 117.239.157[.]74
•	 210.212.224[.]124
•	 49.204.75[.]92
•	 61.2.141[.]161
•	 49.204.75[.]90
•	 114.143.222[.]242
•	 117.211.166[.]22
•	 49.204.65[.]90
•	 49.204.73[.]250 

While STRIKE Team researchers have not observed published vulnerabilities affecting the 
products at the IP addresses above in SecurityScorecard’s datasets, they did note that many 
of these products may be outdated. Twelve of the fourteen IP addresses above feature SSL 
certificates for NETGEAR products issued in either 2007 or 2013. If these certificates’ issue 
dates are also an indication of their products’ age, it may suggest that these products have 
reached end-of-life. This may, in turn, reflect the previously published observation that Volt 
Typhoon and other threat actors using the newly-identified botnet appeared to be taking 
advantage of the widespread use and easy accessibility of end-of-life SOHO devices.

In order to identify additional, possibly-compromised infrastructure involved in the same 
activity, researchers next filtered the traffic sample by product type and focused on IP 
addresses where the strategic partner furnishing the sample observed DrayTek routers, 
given that in one cluster of activity discussed in Lumen’s report, DrayTek devices comprised 
distinct layers of infrastructure through which the threat actors tunneled traffic from other 
compromised devices. This yielded the following IP addresses:
•	 112.120.122[.]88
•	 219.76.184[.]200
•	 14.224.157[.]129
•	 31.120.199[.]123
•	 110.175.91[.]70
•	 125.227.15[.]174
•	 37.224.98[.]249
•	 218.161.3[.]216
•	 82.69.127[.]130
Finally, researchers collected separate traffic samples for each of the IP addresses where 
SecurityScorecard’s partner observed a DrayTek device and then compared these samples 
to identify IP addresses that recurred across them, as their recurrence may suggest that the 
IP addresses correspond to other layers in the same cluster of activity represented by the 
DrayTek routers should this group of DrayTek devices constitute such a layer. The following 
are the IP addresses that appeared in multiple DrayTek devices’ traffic samples:
•	 212.11.108[.]127
•	 212.11.107[.]193
•	 212.11.124[.]98 
•	 129.132.120[.]59 
•	 212.11.106[.]139 
•	 147.87.210[.]109

IP addresses in

Potential Victimology 
STRIKE Team researchers additionally observed communication between two Czech IP 
addresses that appeared in the payload server’s traffic sample and IP addresses hosting 
U.S. government domains. SecurityScorecard’s Attack Surface Intelligence tool indicates 
that both Czech IP addresses host NETGEAR ProSAFE devices.
SecurityScorecard Threat Research: Volt Typhoon    |     16
The recently published reports on new Volt Typhoon activity have noted that it exploited 
NETGEAR firewalls with some regularity. Given that SecurityScorecard’s data reflects the 
use of NETGEAR products at the IP addresses observed and that the same IP addresses 
both contacted a payload server previously linked to Volt Typhoon and other IP addresses 
hosting US government domains, these IP addresses may not only be previously unidentified 
components of Volt Typhoon’s network of compromised devices, but may also reflect Volt 
Typhoon’s targeting of a U.S. and allied government entities. 
An initial traffic sample for these two possibly compromised IP addresses reflected 
communication between them and seven IP addresses to which two different .gov domains, 
login[.]gov and login.gov.external-domains-production.cloud[.]gov, and one Australian 
government domain, login.service.nsw[.]gov[.]au, resolved at the time of observation. 
A second, more recent traffic sample for these same two Czech IP addresses revealed 
repeated communication between them and twenty-seven IP addresses hosting a total 
of sixty-nine U.S. U.K., Australian, and Indian government sites. Given that these domains 
appear to correspond to government assets and that Volt Typhoon has previously targeted 
U.S. government entities, this traffic may reflect additional targeting of the U.S. and allied 
governments by Volt Typhoon or a similar group, although it does not indicate a successful 
compromise. It also bears noting that the IP addresses with which the possible Volt Typhoon 
assets communicated belong to cloud services and content distribution networks, so the 
government domains are likely just a few of many that resolved to them within the observation 
period. That being the case, the possibility that the observed traffic involved other, non-
government domains at the same IP addresses and therefore does not reflect targeting of 
government assets also merits consideration.
While public reporting on Volt Typhoon has not previously noted its targeting of Australian or 
U.K. government assets in addition to U.S. ones, such activity would be in keeping with PRC 
nation-state cyber activity more generally, as these countries’ roles in the Western alliance 
system (including their Five Eyes and AUKUS membership) have contributed to their frequent 
targeting by China-linked APT groups. 
Black Lotus Labs’ recent report assessed that the Volt Typhoon activity observed likely 
reflected the group’s development of new infrastructure in preparation for a period of 
renewed activity. The communications between targeted models of Cisco routers and 
known Volt Typhoon IoCs, which STRIKE Team researchers observed, suggests that these 
preparations are ongoing and extensive, as almost a third of the Cisco devices appearing in 
SecurityScorecard’s dataset communicated with these IoCs in a seven-day period. 
Similarly, the newly-identified IP addresses specified above that may represent new, Volt 
Typhoon-linked IoCs may offer further indication that the group’s preparation of new 
infrastructure has continued. Given their communication with known Volt Typhoon IoCs and 
the appearance of other Volt Typhoon-linked artifacts in SecurityScorecard’s scan data about 
them, the STRIKE Team assesses with moderate confidence that the following IP addresses 
represent previously unidentified Volt Typhoon IoCs:
•	 45.63.60[.]39
•	 45.32.174[.]131
•	 82.117.159[.]158 
•	 46.10.197[.]206
•	 176.102.35[.]175
•	 93.62.0[.]77
•	 194.50.159[.]3
•	 80.64.80[.]169
•	 24.212.225[.]54
•	 208.97.106[.]10
•	 70.60.30[.]222
•	 184.67.141[.]110
•	 89.203.140[.]246
•	 94.125.218[.]19
•	 183.82.110[.]178
•	 117.239.157[.]74
•	 210.212.224[.]124
•	 49.204.75[.]92
•	 61.2.141[.]161
•	 49.204.75[.]90
•	 114.143.222[.]242
•	 117.211.166[.]22
•	 49.204.65[.]90
•	 49.204.73[.]250
While certain contextual factors (the use of devices Volt Typhoon has previously targeted and 
communication with other such devices, including some that in turn communicated with IP 
addresses linked to Volt Typhoon) may suggest that the other IP addresses discussed elsewhere 
in this document are involved in Volt Typhoon-linked activity, the available evidence does not 
appear, at present, to indicate that they represent Volt Typhoon-specific infrastructure.
