An Analysis of the “Destructive” Malware
Behind FBI Warnings
By Trend Micro ⋮
TrendLabs engineers were recently able to obtain a malware sample of the “destructive malware”
described in reports about the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) warning to U.S. businesses last
December 2. According to Reuters, the FBI issued a warning to businesses to remain vigilant against this
new “destructive” malware in the wake of the recent Sony Pictures attack. As of this writing, the link
between the Sony breach and the  malware mentioned by the FBI has yet to be verified.
The FBI flash memo titled “#A-000044-mw” describes an overview of the malware behavior, which
reportedly has the capability to override all data on hard drives of computers, including the master boot
record, which prevents them from booting up.
Below is an analysis of our own findings:
Analysis of the BKDR_WIPALL Malware 
Our detection for the malware detailed in the FBI report is BKDR_WIPALL. Below is a quick overview of
the infection chain for this attack.
2/7
The main installer here is diskpartmg16.exe (detected as BKDR_WIPALL.A). BKDR_WIPALL.A’s overlay
is encrypted with a set of user names and passwords as seen in the screenshot below:
Figure 1. BKDR_WIPALL.A’s overlay contains encrypted user names and passwords
These user names and passwords are found to be encrypted by XOR 0x67 in the overlay of the malware
sample and are then used to log into the shared network. . Once logged in, the malware attempts to grant
full access to everyone that will access the system root.

The dropped net_var.dat contains a list of targeted hostnames:

The next related malware is igfxtrayex.exe (detected as BKDR_WIPALL.B), which is dropped by
BKDR_WIPALL.A. It sleeps for 10 minutes (or 600,000 milliseconds as seen below) before it carries out
its actual malware routines:

This malware’s routines, aside from deleting users’ files, include stopping the Microsoft Exchange
Information Store service. After it does this, the malware sleeps for another two hours. It then forces the
system to reboot.

It also executes several copies of itself named taskhost{random 2 characters}.exe with the following
parameters:
5/7
taskhost{random 2 characters}.exe -w – to drop and execute the component Windows\iissvr.exe
taskhost{random 2 characters}.exe -m – to drop and execute Windows\Temp\usbdrv32.sys
taskhost{random 2 characters}.exe -d – to delete files in all fixed or remote (network) drives

The malware components are encrypted and stored in the resource below:

Additionally, BKDR_WIPALL.B accesses the physical drive that it attempts to overwrite:

We will be updating this post with our additional analysis of the WIPALL malware.
Analysis by Rhena Inocencio and Alvin Bacani
Update as of December 3, 2014, 5:30 PM PST
Upon analysis of the same WIPALL malware family, its variant BKDR_WIPALL.D drops
BKDR_WIPALL.C, which in turn, drops the file walls.bmp in the Windows directory. The .BMP file is as
pictured below:
Figure 11. Dropped wallpaper
This appears to be the same wallpaper described in reports about the recent Sony hack last November
24 bearing the phrase “hacked by #GOP.” Therefore we have reason to believe that this is the same
malware used in the recent attack to Sony Pictures.
Note that BKDR_WIPALL.C is also the dropped named as igfxtrayex.exe in the same directory of
BKDR_WIPALL.D.
We will update this blog entry for more developments.
