Next, the attacker performs second-stage reconnaissance. To elevate privileges, the attacker exploits the CVE-2017-0213 vulnerability in the Windows COM Aggregate Marshaler to run arbitrary code with elevated privileges. Having achieved privilege escalation, the attacker sometimes deploys a VirtualBox virtual machine (VM) with a Windows XP image to evade detection: an early use of a virtual machine image in this manner to run the ransomware encryption attack. The technique has been adopted since by the Maze family of ransomware operators. </p><p>The specially-crafted VM image is loaded to the VirtualBox VM, mapping all local drives as read/writable into the virtual machine. This allows the ransomware process running inside the VM to encrypt all files. To the host files, the encryption appears to be a trusted VirtualBox process and thus will be ignored by many security products.</p><p>Next, the Ragnar Locker operator deletes any extant shadow copies, disables any detected antivirus countermeasures, and uses a PowerShell script to move from one company network asset to another one. Finally, before launching Ragnar Locker ransomware, the attacker steals sensitive files and uploads them to one or more servers to publish them if the victim refuses to pay the ransom.</p><h3><span>Obfuscation</span></h3><p>The ransomware code is protected with obfuscation techniques that include adding junk code as well as encryption. The sample code snippet below shows such junk arithmetic instructions, the results of which are not used:</p><p>After performing its most resource-intensive operations, Ragnar Locker allocates 7680 (1E00) bytes of free memory space in the current process via VirtualAllocEx(). </p><p>It then fills the memory space with shellcode to run it.</p><p>The shellcode’s main goal is to allocate the ransomware executable in memory and call it.</p><p>The first call of VirtualAlloc() allocates 9218 bytes of memory to store the encrypted payload.</p><p>The second call of VirtualAlloc() allocates 48640 (BE00) bytes of memory to store the decrypted payload (PE file).</p><p>The hashes of the decrypted payload are as follows:</p><p>MD5: 6360B252B21FE015D667B093F6497E33</p><p>SHA256: 1DE475E958D7A49EBF4DC342F772781A97AE49C834D9D7235546737150C56A9C</p><p>After resolving the address of the .text section, the ransomware jumps to the original entry point (OEP) of the unpacked sample.</p><h3><span>Locale check</span></h3><p>Ragnar Locker checks the locale info to avoid CIS countries from being infected. It identifies the following languages for exclusion:</p><p>It uses GetLocaleInfoW() with LANG_SYSTEM_DEFAULT and LOCALE_SENGLISHLANGUAGENAME to retrieve the operating system default language of the victim’s machine.</p><p>If the machine’s default language matches one on the CIS list, the ransomware process is terminated with the “666” exit code.</p><h3><span>Command-line arguments</span></h3><p>Ragnar Locker can be run with ‘-list’ or ‘-force’ command-line options. The “-list” argument is passed with a file containing the list of files to be encrypted.</p><p>The ‘-force’ argument is passed with a path pointing to where the encryption should start.</p><p>By default, the ransomware is run without any command-line options, thereby encrypting the whole system.</p><h3><span>Ragnar Locker encryption</span></h3><p>The payload PE file contains a section with the name “.keys” in which the crypto keys and obfuscated configuration strings are stored.</p><p>The ransomware uses hardcoded obfuscated strings, decrypted in runtime.</p><p>The first decrypted value is a unique sample ID.</p><p>Next, it references a list of services to be terminated by Ragnar Locker that include strings related to backup and antivirus solutions (such as ‘sophos’ and ‘veeam’), as well as remote management software (RMM) tools like ConnectWise and Kaseya that are typically used by managed service providers (MSPs).</p><p>The blacklist of processes includes text, database, and email processors. As a result, after terminating the processes, valuable target files such as documents, documents, and emails are released and available for encryption. </p><p>The embedded master RSA-2048 public key uses the PEM format.</p><p>The hardcoded ransom note includes the name of the target organization.</p><p>Ragnar Locker generates two key data arrays of 40 bytes and 32 bytes for use by Salsa20 cipher. </p><p>A custom-named GenKey function uses CryptGenRandom(), then manually initializes a SHA-512 hash with corresponding constants and effects some permutation to encrypt using randomly-generated keys.</p><p>These keys are encrypted by the master RSA-2048 public key and added to the footer of a file.</p><p>To import a RSA-2048 key, the ransomware decodes it from Base64, then executes CryptDecodeObjectEx() to decode the structure of the RSA-2048 key.</p><p>After getting the value ‘1.2.840.113549.1.1.1’ -- which stands for RSAES-PKCS1-v1_5 encryption scheme -- Ragnar Locker imports the public key by using CryptImportPublicKeyInfo().</p><p>With the keys for encryption in hand, the malware next deletes any extant shadow copies by running processes with the following commands:</p><p><i>Wmic.exe shadowcopy delete</i></p><p><i>Vssadmin delete shadows /all /quiet</i></p><p>Ragnar Locker then commences the encryption process in 64 simultaneous threads.</p><p>A whitelist includes the following folders, files and extensions to skip during encryption:</p><p>The file names:</p><p>The file extensions:</p><p>Ragnar Locker uses the Salsa20 encryption algorithm with a custom matrix, which is filled in with generated keys placed in rearranged order. The matrix used for Salsa20 is 64 bytes in size, where 8 bytes defines the stream position, so the ransomware removes 16 bytes from the second key to be matched with the matrix size, and leaves the stream position values with zero bytes.</p><p>Ragnar Locker randomizes file extensions per user by retrieving the computername value and passing it to the next piece of code.</p><p>As output from the code above, ransomware gets 8 bytes and creates the ‘ragnar_{computer_id}’ string to append it to the filename.</p><p>The encrypted file contains the encrypted Salsa20 key data (40+32 bytes) with the signature ‘_RAGNAR_’ added to the footer at the very end.</p><p>To complete the ransom note, Ragnar Locker adds a hardcoded company_id encoded with Base64.</p><p>The ransom note file is named RGNR_{computer_id}.txt:</p><p>*****************************************************************************************************************</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HELLO EDP.com !</p><p>&nbsp;If you reading this message, then your network was PENETRATED and all of your files and data has been ENCRYPTED</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by RAGNAR_LOCKER !</p><p>*****************************************************************************************************************</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;!!!!!

service, using brute force to guess weak passwords or with stolen credentials bought on the Dark Web. Next, the attacker performs second-stage reconnaissance. To elevate privileges, the attacker exploits the CVE-2017-0213 vulnerability in the Windows COM Aggregate Marshaler to run arbitrary code with elevated privileges. Having achieved privilege escalation, the attacker sometimes deploys a VirtualBox virtual machine (VM) with a Windows XP image to evade detection: an early use of a virtual machine image in this manner to run the ransomware encryption attack. The technique has been adopted since by the Maze family of ransomware operators. </span></p><p class="post-paragraph" data-v-5bdddea5><span class="a-dangerous-html" data-v-5bdddea5>The specially-crafted VM image is loaded to the VirtualBox VM, mapping all local drives as read/writable into the virtual machine. This allows the ransomware process running inside the VM to encrypt all files. To the host files, the encryption appears to be a trusted VirtualBox process and thus will be ignored by many security products.</span></p><p class="post-paragraph" data-v-5bdddea5><span class="a-dangerous-html" data-v-5bdddea5>Next, the Ragnar Locker operator deletes any extant shadow copies, disables any detected antivirus countermeasures, and uses a PowerShell script to move from one company network asset to another one. Finally, before launching Ragnar Locker ransomware, the attacker steals sensitive files and uploads them to one or more servers to publish them if the victim refuses to pay the ransom.</span></p><div class="post-title-wrap" data-v-5bdddea5><!----> <h3 id="vF5jfqD8K5" class="post-title" data-v-5bdddea5><span class="a-dangerous-html" data-v-5bdddea5>Obfuscation</span></h3></div><p class="post-paragraph" data-v-5bdddea5><span class="a-dangerous-html" data-v-5bdddea5>The ransomware code is protected with obfuscation techniques that include adding junk code as well as encryption.

By doing so, Mac users retain all the benefits of AFP file sharing and nearly instant Network Spotlight full-content search, while gaining access to resources that have traditionally only been available through SMB\u002FWindows file sharing.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},{"title":"Will Acronis Files Connect recognize clustered configurations?","content":"\u003Cp\u003EAcronis Files Connect is a cluster-aware application that can be run on active\u002Factive clustered configurations.

Multiple instances of Acronis Files Connect can run on a single server node. The configuration of multiple virtual servers provides server consolidation and load management benefits.

So, with a 100-client license, you could have 90 Mac computers and 75 mobile users connected to your Acronis Files Connect server. A “mobile user” is defined as one named user and that user is allowed to connect up to three mobile devices to the server.
