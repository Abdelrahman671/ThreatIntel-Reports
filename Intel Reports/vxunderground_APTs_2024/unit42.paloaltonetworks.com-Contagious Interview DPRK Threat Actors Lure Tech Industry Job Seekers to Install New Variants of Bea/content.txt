Contagious Interview: DPRK Threat Actors Lure Tech Industry Job
Seekers to Install New Variants of BeaverTail and InvisibleFerret
Malware
Unit 42 ⋮ ⋮ 10/9/2024
Executive Summary
Unit 42 has tracked activity from threat actors associated with the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK),
where they pose as recruiters to install malware on tech industry job seekers’ devices. We call this activity the CL-
STA-240 Contagious Interview campaign, and we first published about it in November 2023. Since that publication,
we’ve observed additional online activity from the fake recruiters, as well as code updates to two pieces of malware
associated with the campaign; the BeaverTail downloader and the InvisibleFerret backdoor.
The BeaverTail malware associated with this campaign has been compiled using the Qt framework as early as July
2024. We have observed multiple samples of BeaverTail that are compiled for both macOS and Windows platforms.
In addition, we observed continuous code updates to the InvisibleFerret backdoor delivered by the BeaverTail
downloader.
In this article, we will discuss the online activity of fake recruiters and technical details of the campaign, including the
following specifics:

Social Engineering and Infection: Fake Recruiters and Job Interviews
As described in our previous article on Contagious Interview, the threat actor behind CL-STA-0240 contacts software
developers through job search platforms by posing as a prospective employer. The attackers invite the victim to
participate in an online interview, where the threat actor attempts to convince the victim to download and install
malware. Recent reporting and social media activity like this thread on X (formerly Twitter) indicate this activity
continues.
A June 2024 Medium article describes a relatively recent example. In this case, a fake recruiter account using the
name Onder Kayabasi contacted the writer over LinkedIn.
While this LinkedIn account is no longer available, a similar account for Onder Kayabasi remained active on X
(formerly known as Twitter) as recently as August 2024. Figure 1 shows the X profile for this user.

After the attacker set up a technical interview online, the attacker convinced the potential victim to execute malicious
code. In this case, the potential victim purposefully ran the code in a virtual environment, which eventually connected
back to the attacker's command and control (C2) server 95.164.17[.]24:1224, as noted below in Figure 2.

Another social media post noted the same type of activity and IP address on Reddit as noted below in Figure 3. This
is the same IP address and TCP port used by the new version of the BeaverTail malware that we analyze in the next
section.

This activity is consistent with our previous report on the CL-STA-0240 Contagious Interview campaign. And like
previous activity from this campaign, the initial malware is BeaverTail.
Analysis of BeaverTail's New Cross-Platform Version
BeaverTail is a downloader and infostealer associated with the CL-STA-0240 campaign, which we first reported on in
2023. In this campaign the attackers delivered BeaverTail via files masquerading as the following applications:
MiroTalk, a real-time video call application
FreeConference, a service that offers free conference calling
Threat actors often abuse, take advantage of or subvert legitimate products for malicious purposes. This does not
imply that the legitimate product is flawed or malicious.
Similar findings were also detailed in GROUP-IB’s recent research.
In recent months, the attackers created new versions of the BeaverTail malware. This time instead of coding it in
JavaScript like previous versions, they wrote the new version in Qt.
Since Qt enables developers to create cross-platform applications, the attackers could use the same source code to
compile applications for both Windows and macOS simultaneously. Figure 4 shows the installation process of
BeaverTail in both Windows and macOS.
5/10
Figure 4. Left: Fake MiroTalk BeaverTail installation in Windows. Right: Fake MiroTalk BeaverTail installation in macOS.
When installing the macOS variant of BeaverTail in the form of a fake MiroTalk package, the victim must mount the
MiroTalk.dmg disk image and run the package within that image. For Windows, the respective installation package file
is named MiroTalk.msi.
Objective-See published an article in July 2024 analyzing the macOS version of BeaverTail, describing its main
capabilities, such as data exfiltration and execution of additional payloads.
After the malicious applications are successfully installed, when the victim opens the applications for the first time,
they see a GUI as shown in Figure 5.
Figure 5. Left: BeaverTail opens a fake login window for FreeConference.com. Right: BeaverTail opens a fake login window for MiroTal
Meanwhile, BeaverTail executes its malicious code in the background, collecting data and exfiltrating it from the
victim's host without any visible indicators.
This Qt-based version of BeaverTail has largely the same functionality as the JavaScript-based version we analyzed
in November 2023. Additional features in this new Qt version of BeaverTail include:
Stealing browser passwords in macOS
Stealing cryptocurrency wallets in both macOS and Windows (shown in Figure 6)
This last feature is consistent with the ongoing financial interests of North Korean threat actors.

Additionally, this newer Qt version of BeaverTail targets 13 different cryptocurrency wallet browser extensions,
compared to only nine wallets previously targeted by the JavaScript variant. Of the current 13 extensions, the authors
added 5 for new wallets, and removed one. Table 1 lists the cryptocurrency wallet browser extensions IDs, names
and targeted browsers.

After exfiltrating collected data to the C2, BeaverTail attempts to download the Python programming language to the
infected machine from the URL hxxp://<c2_server>:1224/pdown. Downloading Python is essential to successfully
executing the InvisibleFerret backdoor payload, which is written in Python. This enables InvisibleFerret to be cross
platform as well.
Figure 7 below shows the code responsible for downloading Python from BeaverTail’s C2 server.

Next, the malware will download the first stage of InvisibleFerret from the URL
hxxp://<c2_server>:1224/client/<campaign_id>, as shown in Figure 8.

The Final Python Backdoor Payload: InvisibleFerret
InvisibleFerret is a Python backdoor that we fully analyzed in our previous article on the Contagious Interview
campaign. InvisibleFerret has multiple components:
7/10
An initial downloader: Responsible for downloading the other two components listed below
Main payload component - Its capabilities include:
Fingerprinting the infected endpoint
Remote control of the infected endpoint
Keylogging
Exfiltrating sensitive files
Downloading the AnyDesk client on-demand for additional remote control capabilities
Browser stealer component: Enables the attackers to steal browser credentials and credit card information
Figure 9 shows the execution flow of InvisibleFerret’s components as described in our previous analysis.

By examining the latest InvisibleFerret versions deployed in this campaign during the past year, we saw slight code
changes implemented over time. While its general functionality remains nearly identical, these changes suggest that
the malware authors are actively working on the malware’s code in between the waves of their attacks.
In this section we will examine the code changes between the InvisibleFerret backdoor deployed by the BeaverTail
installer that masquerades as MiroTalk and the BeaverTail installer that masquerades as the FreeConference service
application. Noticeable code modifications are shown in Table 2.
Command InvisibleFerret Installed by Fake
MiroTalk Installer
InvisibleFerret Installed by Fake FreeConference
Installer
ssh_cmd
Checks if the argument value is equal
to delete and if so, closes the session.
To notify the C2 server, it sends the
message string [close].
Checks the OS type. If the OS type is Windows, it tries to
kill python.exe via the taskkill command.
If the OS type is not Windows, it tries to kill Python via the
killall command
ssh_env
Collects content from specific folders
(Documents and Downloads for
Windows, /home and /Volumes for
others), and uploads these files to the
attacker’s FTP server.
On Windows:

Collects .env files from all folders under the following
drives:  C:\, D:\, E\, F:\, G:\ while ignoring folders named
node_modules. Other OSes: Collects .env files from all
folders under the home directory (~) while ignoring folders
named node_modules
Table 2. InvisibleFerret code updates.
Figure 10 shows a comparison of the ssh_cmd function code between the different versions of InvisibleFerret.
Figure 10. ssh_cmd code comparison between the different versions of InvisibleFerret.
Another interesting change was implemented in one of the subcommands of ssh_upload named ss_ufind. This
subcommand enables the attackers to search for files matching a given pattern.
In the older InvisibleFerret version, the attackers first collected the names of all the files and only then did the Python
code filter out names by pattern. In the newer version, InvisibleFerret uses the Windows findstr or macOS find
8/10
commands to search for the files by a specific pattern, thus making the code more efficient.
Conclusion
In this article, we present recent activity from the CL-STA-0240 Contagious Interview campaign.
In this campaign, the attackers targeted job-seeking individuals on LinkedIn, luring them to download and execute
malware that masquerades as a legitimate video call application. This campaign is a continuation of activity we
initially reported in November 2023.
The attackers behind this campaign introduced a new Qt version of the BeaverTail malware as early as July 2024.
The malware authors compiled BeaverTail variants for both Windows and macOS from the same source code using
the Qt programming language.
North Korean threat actors are known to conduct financial crimes for funds to support the DPRK regime. This
campaign may be financially motivated, since the BeaverTail malware has the capability of stealing 13 different
cryptocurrency wallets.
The infection chain culminates in deploying the InvisibleFerret Python backdoor, which enabled the attackers to
maintain control of the machine and exfiltrate sensitive data. We also detailed new features of the InvisibleFerret
Python backdoor variant seen in this campaign.
Another important risk that this campaign poses is potential infiltration of the companies who employ the targeted job
seekers. A successful infection on a company-owned endpoint could result in collection and exfiltration of sensitive
information.
It is essential for individuals and organizations to be aware of such advanced social engineering campaigns. We
encourage the community to leverage our findings to inform the deployment of protective measures to defend against
such threats.
