Cyber attack on the Ukrinform information and
communication system (CERT-UA#5850
In the Telegram channel "CyberArmyofRussia_Reborn" on 17.01.2023 at around 12:39, information was
published about the violation of the normal functioning of several elements of the information and
communication system (hereinafter - ICS) of the Ukrainian National Information Agency "Ukrinform".
At
the Agency's request, the Government Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine CERT-UA
initiated measures to investigate a cyberattack on January 17, 2023.
As of January 27, 2023, 5 samples
of malicious programs (scripts) were detected, the functionality of which is aimed at violating the integrity
and availability of information (writing files/disks with zero bytes/arbitrary data and their subsequent
deletion), namely:
CaddyWiper (Windows)
ZeroWipe (Windows)
SDelete (Windows)
AwfulShred (Linux)
BidSwipe (FreeBSD)
It was found that the attackers made an unsuccessful attempt to disrupt the regular
operation of users' computers using the CaddyWiper and ZeroWipe malicious programs, as well as the
legitimate SDelete utility (which was supposed to be launched using "news.bat"). At the same time, for
the purpose of centralized distribution of malicious programs, a group policy object (GPO) was created,
which, in turn, ensured the creation of corresponding scheduled tasks.
There are reasons to believe that
the intelligence stage of the ICS of the Ukrainian National Information Agency "Ukrinform" will be
conducted no later than 07.12.2022. It was established that the final stage of the cyber attack was
initiated on 17.01.2023, however, it was only partially successful, in particular, in relation to several data
storage systems.
In the process of research, an element of ICS was identified, with the help of which the
prerequisites for unauthorized remote access to the Agency's information resources were created.
Taking
into account the results of the study, we believe it is possible to state that the cyber attack was carried out
by the UAC-0082 (Sandworm) group, whose activities are associated with the Russian Federation.
It
should be noted that the mentioned Telegram channel, along with typical messages about DDoS attacks
and defaces, exclusively highlights the destructive activity carried out by the mentioned group.
