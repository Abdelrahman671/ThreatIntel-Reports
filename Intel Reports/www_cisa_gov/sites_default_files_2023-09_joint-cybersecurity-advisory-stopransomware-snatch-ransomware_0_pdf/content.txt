#StopRansomware: Snatch Ransomware 
SUMMARY 
Note: This joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) is part of 
an ongoing #StopRansomware effort to publish 
advisories for network defenders that detail various 
ransomware variants and ransomware threat actors. 
These #StopRansomware advisories include recently 
and historically observed tactics, techniques, and 
procedures (TTPs) and indicators of compromise (IOCs) 
to help organizations protect against ransomware. Visit 
stopransomware.gov to see all #StopRansomware 
advisories and to learn more about other ransomware 
threats and no-cost resources. 
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency 
(CISA) are releasing this joint CSA to disseminate known ransomware IOCs and TTPs associated 
with the Snatch ransomware variant identified through FBI investigations as recently as June 1, 2023. 
Since mid-2021, Snatch threat actors have consistently evolved their tactics to take advantage of 
current trends in the cybercriminal space and leveraged successes of other ransomware variants’ 
operations. Snatch threat actors have targeted a wide range of critical infrastructure sectors including 
the Defense Industrial Base (DIB), Food and Agriculture, and Information Technology sectors. Snatch 
threat actors conduct ransomware operations involving data exfiltration and double extortion. After 
data exfiltration often involving direct communications with victims demanding ransom, Snatch threat 
actors may threaten victims with double extortion, where the victims’ data will be posted on Snatch’s 
extortion blog if the ransom goes unpaid. 
FBI and CISA encourage organizations to implement the recommendations in the Mitigations section 
of this CSA to reduce the likelihood and impact of ransomware incidents. 
For a downloadable copy of IOCs, see: 
• 
AA23-263A STIX XML (80 KB) 
• 
AA23-263A STIX JSON (56 KB) 
Actions to take today to mitigate 
malicious cyber activity: 
• 
Secure and closely monitor Remote 
Desktop Protocol (RDP). 
• 
Maintain offline backups of data. 
• 
Enable and enforce phishing-
resistant multifactor authentication 
(MFA).

TECHNICAL DETAILS 
Note: This advisory uses the MITRE ATT&CK for Enterprise framework, version 13. See the MITRE 
ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques section for a table of the threat actors’ activity mapped to MITRE 
ATT&CK® tactics and techniques. For assistance with mapping malicious cyber activity to the MITRE 
ATT&CK framework, see CISA and MITRE ATT&CK’s Best Practices for MITRE ATT&CK Mapping 
and CISA’s Decider Tool. 
First appearing in 2018, Snatch operates a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model and claimed their 
first U.S.-based victim in 2019. Originally, the group was referred to as Team Truniger, based on the 
nickname of a key group member, Truniger, who previously operated as a GandCrab affiliate. Snatch 
threat actors use a customized ransomware variant notable for rebooting devices into Safe Mode 
[T1562.009], enabling the ransomware to circumvent detection by antivirus or endpoint protection, 
and then encrypting files when few services are running. 
Snatch threat actors have been observed purchasing previously stolen data from other ransomware 
variants in an attempt to further exploit victims into paying a ransom to avoid having their data 
released on Snatch’s extortion blog. Note: Since November 2021, an extortion site operating under 
the name Snatch served as a clearinghouse for data exfiltrated or stolen from victim companies on 
Clearnet and TOR hosted by a bulletproof hosting service. In August 2023, individuals claiming to be 
associated with the blog gave a media interview claiming the blog was not associated with Snatch 
ransomware and “none of our targets has been attacked by Ransomware Snatch…”, despite multiple 
confirmed Snatch victims’ data appearing on the blog alongside victims associated with other 
ransomware groups, notably Nokoyawa and Conti.[1] 
Initial Access and Persistence 
Snatch threat actors employ several different methods to gain access to and maintain persistence on 
a victim’s network. Snatch affiliates primarily rely on exploiting weaknesses in Remote Desktop 
Protocol (RDP) [T1133] for brute-forcing and gaining administrator credentials to victims’ networks 
[T1110.001]. In some instances, Snatch affiliates have sought out compromised credentials from 
criminal forums/marketplaces [T1078].  
Snatch threat actors gain persistence on a victim’s network by compromising an administrator 
account [T1078.002] and establishing connections over port 443 [T1071.001] to a command and 
control (C2) server located on a Russian bulletproof hosting service [T1583.003]. Per IP traffic from 
event logs provided by recent victims, Snatch threat actors initiated RDP connections from a Russian 
bulletproof hosting service and through other virtual private network (VPN) services [T1133]. 
Data Discovery and Lateral Movement 
Snatch threat actors were observed using different TTPs to discover data, move laterally, and search 
for data to exfiltrate. Snatch threat actors use sc.exe to configure, query, stop, start, delete, and add 
system services using the Windows Command line. In addition to sc.exe, Snatch threat actors also 
use tools such as Metasploit and Cobalt Strike [S0154]. 
Prior to deploying the ransomware, Snatch threat actors were observed spending up to three months 
on a victim’s system. Within this timeframe, Snatch threat actors exploited the victim’s network 
 
 
 
FBI | CISA  
TLP:CLEAR 
 
Page 3 of 16  |  Product ID: AA23-263A 
TLP:CLEAR 
 
[T1590], moving laterally across the victim’s network with RDP [T1021.001] for the largest possible 
deployment of ransomware and searching for files and folders [T1005] for data exfiltration [TA0010] 
followed by file encryption [T1486]. 
Defense Evasion and Execution 
During the early stages of ransomware deployment, Snatch threat actors attempt to disable antivirus 
software [T1562.001] and run an executable as a file named safe.exe or some variation thereof. In 
recent victims, the ransomware executable’s name consisted of a string of hexadecimal characters 
which match the SHA-256 hash of the file in an effort to defeat rule-based detection [T1036]. Upon 
initiation, the Snatch ransomware payload queries and modifies registry keys [T1012][T1112], uses 
various native Windows tools to enumerate the system [T1569.002], finds processes [T1057], and 
creates benign processes to execute Windows batch (.bat) files [T1059.003]. In some instances, the 
program attempts to remove all the volume shadow copies from a system [T1490]. After the execution 
of the batch files, the executable removes the batch files from the victim’s filesystem [T1070.004]. 
The Snatch ransomware executable appends a series of hexadecimal characters to each file and 
folder name it encrypts—unique to each infection—and leaves behind a text file titled HOW TO 
RESTORE YOUR FILES.TXT in each folder. Snatch threat actors communicate with their victims 
through email and the Tox communication platform based on identifiers left in ransom notes or 
through their extortion blog. Since November 2021, some victims reported receiving a spoofed call 
from an unknown female who claimed association with Snatch and directed them to the group’s 
extortion site. In some instances, Snatch victims had a different ransomware variant deployed on their 
systems, but received a ransom note from Snatch threat actors. As a result, the victims’ data is 
posted on the ransomware blog involving the different ransomware variant and on the Snatch threat 
actors’ extortion blog. 
Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) 
The Snatch IOCs detailed in this section were obtained through FBI investigations from September 
2022 through June 2023. 
Email Domains and Addresses 
Since 2019, Snatch threat actors have used numerous email addresses to email victims. Email 
addresses used by Snatch threat actors are random but usually originate from one of the following 
domains listed in Tables 1 and 2:

Table 2 shows a list of legitimate email domains offering encrypted email services that have been 
used by Snatch threat actors. These email domains are all publicly available and legal. The use of 
these email domains by a threat actor should not be attributed to the email domains, absent specific 
articulable facts tending to show they are used at the direction or under the control of a threat actor.

MITIGATIONS 
The FBI and CISA recommend organizations implement 
the mitigations below to improve your organization’s 
cybersecurity posture on the basis of the Snatch threat 
actor’s activity. These mitigations align with the Cross-
Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs) 
developed by CISA and the National Institute of 
Standards and Technology (NIST). The CPGs provide a 
minimum set of practices and protections that CISA and 
NIST recommend all organizations implement. CISA 
and NIST based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity 
frameworks and guidance to protect against the most 
common and impactful threats, tactics, techniques, and 
procedures. Visit CISA’s Cross-Sector Cybersecurity 
Performance Goals for more information on the CPGs, 
including additional recommended baseline protections. 
• 
Reduce threat of malicious actors using remote access tools by: 
o Auditing remote access tools on your network to identify currently used and/or 
authorized software. 
o Reviewing logs for execution of remote access software to detect abnormal use of 
programs running as a portable executable [CPG 2.T]. 
o Using security software to detect instances of remote access software being loaded only 
in memory. 
o Requiring authorized remote access solutions to be used only from within your network 
over approved remote access solutions, such as virtual private networks (VPNs) or virtual 
desktop interfaces (VDIs). 
o Blocking both inbound and outbound connections on common remote access 
software ports and protocols at the network perimeter. 
• 
Implement application controls to manage and control execution of software, including 
allowlisting remote access programs. 
o Application controls should prevent installation and execution of portable versions of 
unauthorized remote access and other software. A properly configured application 
allowlisting solution will block any unlisted application execution. Allowlisting is important 
because antivirus solutions may fail to detect the execution of malicious portable 
executables when the files use any combination of compression, encryption, or 
obfuscation. 
• 
Strictly limit the use of RDP and other remote desktop services. If RDP is necessary, 
rigorously apply best practices, for example [CPG 2.W]: 
o Audit the network for systems using RDP. 
o Close unused RDP ports. 
o Enforce account lockouts after a specified number of attempts. 
These mitigations apply to all stakeholders. The 
authoring agencies recommend that software 
manufactures incorporate secure-by-design and 
-default principles and tactics into their software 
development practices for hardening software 
against ransomware attacks (e.g., to prevent 
threat actors from using Safe Mode to evade 
detection and file encryption), thus 
strengthening the secure posture for their 
customers.

CISA’s Secure by Design and Default webpage 
and joint guide.

o Apply phishing-resistant multifactor authentication (MFA). 
o Log RDP login attempts. 
• 
Disable command-line and scripting activities and permissions [CPG 2.N]. 
• 
Review domain controllers, servers, workstations, and active directories for new and/or 
unrecognized accounts [CPG 4.C]. 
• 
Audit user accounts with administrative privileges and configure access controls 
according to the principle of least privilege (PoLP) [CPG 2.E]. 
• 
Reduce the threat of credential compromise via the following: 
o Place domain admin accounts in the protected users’ group to prevent caching of 
password hashes locally. 
o Refrain from storing plaintext credentials in scripts. 
• 
Implement time-based access for accounts set at the admin level and higher [CPG 2.A, 
2.E]. 
In addition, the authoring authorities of this CSA recommend network defenders apply the following 
mitigations to limit potential adversarial use of common system and network discovery techniques, 
and to reduce the impact and risk of compromise by ransomware or data extortion actors: 
• 
Implement a recovery plan to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary 
data and servers in a physically separate, segmented, and secure location (i.e., hard drive, 
storage device, the cloud). 
• 
Maintain offline backups of data and regularly maintain backup and restoration (daily or 
weekly at minimum). By instituting this practice, an organization limits the severity of disruption 
to its business practices [CPG 2.R]. 
• 
Require all accounts with password logins (e.g., service account, admin accounts, and 
domain admin accounts) to comply with NIST's standards for developing and managing 
password policies. 
o Use longer passwords consisting of at least eight characters and no more than 64 
characters in length [CPG 2.B]. 
o Store passwords in hashed format using industry-recognized password managers. 
o Add password user “salts” to shared login credentials. 
o Avoid reusing passwords [CPG 2.C]. 
o Implement multiple failed login attempt account lockouts [CPG 2.G]. 
o Disable password “hints.” 
o Refrain from requiring password changes more frequently than once per year. 
Note: NIST guidance suggests favoring longer passwords instead of requiring regular and 
frequent password resets. Frequent password resets are more likely to result in users 
developing password “patterns” cyber criminals can easily decipher. 
o Require administrator credentials to install software. 
• 
Require phishing-resistant multifactor authentication (MFA) for all services to the extent 
possible, particularly for webmail, virtual private networks (VPNs), and accounts that access 
critical systems [CPG 2.H]. 
• 
Keep all operating systems, software, and firmware up to date. Timely patching is one of 
the most efficient and cost-effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to

cybersecurity threats. Prioritize patching known exploited vulnerabilities in internet-facing 
systems [CPG 1.E]. 
• 
Segment networks to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can help 
prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and access to—
various subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement [CPG 2.F]. 
• 
Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the 
indicated ransomware with a networking monitoring tool. To aid in detecting the 
ransomware, implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic and activity, including 
lateral movement, on a network. Endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools are particularly 
useful for detecting lateral connections as they have insight into common and uncommon 
network connections for each host [CPG 3.A]. 
• 
Install, regularly update, and enable real time detection for antivirus software on all 
hosts. 
• 
Disable unused ports and protocols [CPG 2.V]. 
• 
Consider adding an email banner to emails received from outside your organization [CPG 
2.M]. 
• 
Disable hyperlinks in received emails. 
• 
Ensure all backup data is encrypted, immutable (i.e., ensure backup data cannot be 
altered or deleted), and covers the entire organization’s data infrastructure [CPG 2.K, 2.L, 
2.R]. 
VALIDATE SECURITY CONTROLS 
In addition to applying mitigations, FBI and CISA recommend exercising, testing, and validating your 
organization's security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK for 
Enterprise framework in this advisory. FBI and CISA recommend testing your existing security 
controls inventory to assess how they perform against the ATT&CK techniques described in this 
advisory. 
To get started: 
1. Select an ATT&CK technique described in this advisory (see Tables 4-16). 
2. Align your security technologies against the technique. 
3. Test your technologies against the technique. 
4. Analyze your detection and prevention technologies’ performance. 
5. Repeat the process for all security technologies to obtain a set of comprehensive performance 
data. 
6. Tune your security program, including people, processes, and technologies, based on the 
data generated by this process. 
FBI and CISA recommend continually testing your security program, at scale, in a production 
environment to ensure optimal performance against the MITRE ATT&CK techniques identified in this 
advisory.

REPORTING 
The FBI is seeking any information that can be shared, to include boundary logs showing 
communication to and from IP addresses, a sample ransom note, communications with Snatch threat 
actors, Bitcoin wallet information, decryptor files, and/or a benign sample of an encrypted file. The FBI 
and CISA strongly discourage paying ransom as payment does not guarantee victim files will be 
recovered. Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, 
encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit 
activities. Regardless of whether you or your organization have decided to pay the ransom, the FBI 
and CISA urge you to promptly report ransomware incidents to the FBI Internet Crime Complaint 
Center (IC3) at ic3.gov, a local FBI Field Office, or to CISA at report@cisa.gov or (888) 282-0870.
