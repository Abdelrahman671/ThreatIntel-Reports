ELECTRUM Targeted Ukrainian Electric Entity Using Custom Tools
and CaddyWiper Malware, October 2022

Dragos, Inc.
On November 9, 2023, Mandiant released new details from forensic investigations following a disruptive attack
against Ukraine electric substation which started in June 2022 and culminated in two events on October 10 and 12,
2022. Dragos associates this activity with the ELECTRUM threat group (has technical overlaps with SANDWORM
Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)). ELECTRUM is responsible for several cyber attacks on Ukrainian electric utilities
and a 2016 power outage that resulted in the disruption of power to ¼ million homes, and this newly disclosed attack
shares similarities with previous attacks.
Understanding the tactics and tools employed by ELECTRUM from an intelligence perspective and the ability to hunt
and monitor for their known behaviors and indicators in OT environments should be prioritized for ICS assets located
in Ukraine, and where the European electric industry is concerned.
ELECTRUM Cyber Breach Timeline
In June of 2022, ELECTRUM gained access to a hypervisor running an end-of-life (EOL) version of MicroSCADA
software in the electric substation’s OT environment. ELECTRUM then attempted to execute a set of custom living off
the land (LOTL) scripts to impact the availability and control of the substation. ELECTRUM also utilized a new version
of CaddyWiper to remove their operational footprint from the electric substation’s compromised IT systems. These
actions by ELECTRUM satisfy Stage 1 and Stage 2 of the ICS Cyber Kill Chain.
ELECTRUM Cyber Breach Timeline
At that same time in October, Russia attacked Ukraine with massive missile strikes targeting key energy
infrastructure, damaging 30 percent of the energy infrastructure in Ukraine with power supply interruptions in many
locations.

Currently, Dragos is unsure of exactly what ELECTRUM’s dormancy suggests other than potential system
reconnaissance and collections activities. Dragos cannot confirm whether this attack was successful in interrupting
the substation and thus impacting power in Ukraine. The initial compromise vector for the June-October events has
not been identified.
ELECTRUM Attacks on the Ukraine Electric Sector
The State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection of Ukraine (SSSCIP) reported that
Ukraine’s Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-UA) recorded 2,100 cyber incidents in 2022. While only a
subset of incidents is associated with ELECTRUM, the energy sector was a particular focus in the region and
ELECTRUM has been responsible for several major attacks on the electric sector going back to 2015.
In April 2022, the security firm ESET identified multiple malware capabilities at a Ukrainian utility provider. During the
incident, ELECTRUM remained dormant on the electric entity’s network for at least one month before the attack was
to occur. This is a consistent pattern for ELECTRUM: gain access to a network, remain dormant, potentially collect
system details, and then build custom scripts and tools prior to executing a destructive cyber attack. This attack used
a new version of CaddyWiper, other custom wipers, and Industroyer2 (a scaled-back version of CRASHOVERRIDE).
This marked the third time ELECTRUM had attacked a Ukrainian utility provider.
Given ELECTRUM’s destructive history, ELECTRUM’s likely objectives were to execute the commands against the
MicroSCADA utility to impact the availability and control of the electric substation. It is interesting that MicroSCADA
software, designed for legitimate purposes in operational technology environments, was used during this incident.
While the effect of use remains unclear, this tactic is noteworthy and should be used to update and inform threat
models for future cyber attacks.
MicroSCADA has been deployed in more than 10,000 substations and monitors the electric supply for more than 10
percent of the world’s population. In addition, the compromised version of MicroSCADA was considered end-of-life
(EOL), which means that it was software that the manufacturer or vendor no longer supported. Similarly, the creation
of the PIPEDREAM ICS-specific malware involved the implementation and use of known industrial protocols OPC-UA
and Modbus. This reinforces the importance of considering the role of native software and capabilities in OT-focused
cyber attacks.
Recommendations
Dragos recommends referencing the five critical controls for OT cybersecurity identified by the SANS Institute for a
framework for defending against adversary activity directed against ICS/OT system environments.
Among the critical controls is ensuring OT network monitoring. In addition to scanning for known indicators of
compromise (IOCs), Dragos also recommends monitoring in the form of proactive threat hunting to identify potentially
malicious tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) in the environment. If an adversary somehow gains access to a
network, threat hunting serves as an essential last line of defense to find and stop a breach before significant impacts
occur, like execution of a wiper or causing physical effects in a process control environment.
As noted above, ELECTRUM attacks against electric utilities have typically involved long dwell times between initial
access and finally turning out the lights. In the latest attack reported by Mandiant, threat hunting for the following
types of suspicious behaviors in the OT network during that dwell time could have helped uncover the adversary
before they achieved their objectives:
Unexpected file transfers from the enterprise network (or an external sever) into to the OT/ICS network,
specifically, the transfer of an .iso file to a “Crown Jewel” SCADA system
Transfer and execution of unexpected scripts like PowerShell (.ps1), Visual Basic (.vbs), and Batch (.bat) files
on a SCADA server
Unexpected commands issued from SCADA servers to RTUs
These are just a few examples of the wide range of behaviors that proactive threat hunting can help reveal to thwart
an intrusion. The Dragos OT Watch team provides managed threat hunting and serves as a force multiplier for
existing security teams seeking assistance with threat hunting in their OT environments. Threat-based detections for
ELECTRUM TTPs are codified in the Dragos Platform for enhanced visibility of threats to ICS assets.
