# ThreatIntel-Reports

A repository of extracted content from thousands of threat intelligence reports, with an automatic extraction of reports from various feeds !

## Usage

  - **Search by Keyword on the [site](https://mthcht.github.io/ThreatIntel-Reports/)** : Use the search bar to explore predefined search results. (Currently expanding to cover over 2000 tools and some APT Groups. Let me know if youâ€™d like a specific keyword added by default !)

  - **Search by Keyword in CLI**: Clone the repository and execute `python search_keyword.py`. The script will prompt you to enter one or multiple keywords separated by commas. It will search for the keywords in all the available reports and save the results in a JSON file that can be integrated into the site if desired (to be searchable on the UI).
