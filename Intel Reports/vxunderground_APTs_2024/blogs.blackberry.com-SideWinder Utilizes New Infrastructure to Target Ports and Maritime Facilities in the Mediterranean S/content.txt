SideWinder Utilizes New Infrastructure to Target Ports and Maritime
Facilities in the Mediterranean Sea
The BlackBerry Research and Intelligence Team ⋮ ⋮ 7/25/2024
Summary
As part of our continuous threat hunting efforts, the BlackBerry Threat Research and Intelligence team has
discovered a new campaign by the nation-state threat actor known as SideWinder. We have been actively tracking
this threat actor since our last report on the group in mid-2023. SideWinder has since upgraded its infrastructure and
now utilizes new techniques and tactics in its efforts to compromise victims.
By analyzing the data uncovered during our research, which includes highly specific logos and themes in the phishing
emails sent by the group, we conclude with medium confidence that SideWinder’s new campaign is targeting ports
and maritime facilities in the Indian Ocean and Mediterranean Sea.
Domains and documents used with the first stage delivery imply targeting of Pakistan, Egypt and Sri Lanka.
Subdomains used with the second stage delivery indicate additional targeting of Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nepal and
the Maldives.
Based on SideWinder's prior campaigns, we believe that the goal of this new campaign is espionage and intelligence
gathering.

Technical Analysis
Context
The SideWinder APT group, also known as Razor Tiger, Rattlesnake, and T-APT-04, is believed to originate from
India. As one of the oldest nation-state threat actors, SideWinder has been active since at least 2012. The group has
previously been observed targeting military, government, and business entities, with a particular focus on Pakistan,
Afghanistan, China, and Nepal.
SideWinder makes use of email spear-phishing, document exploitation and DLL side-loading techniques in an
attempt to avoid detection and deliver targeted implants. Typically, the victim downloads a malicious document with
very shallow detection on VirusTotal and opens it, triggering the next stage of the attack chain.
Visual Bait Documents
The malicious document is very carefully prepared by the threat actor to pass muster as a legitimate document from
an official organization already known to the target. It may include elements such as familiar logos, company names
and themes the target recognizes due to their job location or field of work. In this instance, we observed falsified
“visual bait” documents that claimed to be associated with very specific port infrastructure, including the Port of
Alexandria in the Mediterranean Sea. We also observed a visual lure masquerading as the Port Authority of the Red
Sea.
During our research, we detected a total of three visual decoys used by the threat actor. Visual decoys may not in
themselves be malicious; their primary purpose is to distract the victim from realizing they are being compromised.
They achieve this goal by using document titles calculated to cause anxiety in the reader, who is presumably an
employee at a target organization. For example in Figure 2 below, emotive phrases such as “employee termination”
and “salary cut” are used in the body copy.
Threat actors hope that by eliciting strong emotions such as fear or anxiety, the target will be compelled to
immediately open and read the document. The victim will then be so distracted that they won’t notice strange events
on their device such as (for example) system popups or increased fan noise caused by high CPU utilization, which is
often an early warning sign of a malware infection in progress.

Figure 1: A visual lure contained in one of the malicious documents.
The visual decoy in Figure 1, above, was one of the last used by the threat actor in the campaign we analyzed. Note
the typical red flags of a phishing campaign present in this faked letter, including the highly charged subject matter
and emotive phrases like “grave seriousness”, “prosecution” and “breaking the law.” There is also a call-to-action
that urges the reader to “read the investigation report carefully and thoroughly.”
The overall effect of this letter is calculated to make the recipient stop whatever they are doing and give immediate
attention to the letter and the report it is referring to.

Figure 2: Another visual lure that abuses the logo of the (legitimate) Red Sea Port Authority in Egypt.
The same tactics are used in the visual lure shown in Figure 2, above. See how the threat actor has taken the
additional step of adding bold formatting the most emotionally loaded phrases in the decoy letter, which include
“depleted most of our financial reserves,” “serious concern,” and “terminate employment.” Even the title of the
document — “EMPLOYEE TERMINATION AND SALARY CUT NOTICE” — is intended to make any employee at
any company fearful for the safety of their job. The threat actor hopes the target will immediately open and read the
letter in a stake of high anxiety.

These malicious documents all use a remote template injection technique (CVE-2017-0199) to gain initial access to
the target’s system. This CVE is a known vulnerability in Microsoft Office. Exploitation of this vulnerability requires
that a user open or preview a specially crafted file with an affected version of Microsoft Office or WordPad. In a
phishing email attack scenario, an attacker exploits the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted file to the user and
then convinces them (via the methods we’ve outlined above) to open the file.
The patch for this CVE has been available since 2017, so threat actors are hedging their bets that many large
organizations with outdated, fragmented or antiquated infrastructures may have a number of endpoints that are not
properly patched.
Malware authors very commonly use Word documents in phishing attacks because they are widely used and are
easily disguised as legitimate files. They also support malicious macros and embedded objects, making them a highly
effective vector for malware delivery and execution on outdated or unpatched systems.
That much said, let’s dive back into the SideWinder attack chain. The body of the document delivered as a phishing
email contains a URL in plain text, which links to a malicious site (usually owned by the threat actor) where the next
stage file will be downloaded from. Once the lure document is opened, it contacts the specified URL address and
downloads the next stage of the attack.

Next, a rich text format (RTF) file downloads a document that exploits the CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability. It contains
shellcode that will be executed after opening the file. This technical detail is notable because, in a previous
SideWinder campaign, the malware used JavaScript (JS) concealed in an RTF file.
The purpose of the shellcode is to check the victim's system to see if the system is real and not a virtual environment
such as a VM (virtual machine), which is typically used by defenders. The shellcode checks the system’s processor
type, and only allows the program to continue its execution if the processor type is Intel or AMD. This ensures that the
attack chain stays under the radar and is not halted by security operation center (SOC) teams.
If the system on which the shellcode is running is found to be suitable for the threat actor, the program next decrypts
and runs a tiny JavaScript code. This code will load the next execution step from the remote server, which will also be
a JavaScript code.

Based on our historical data, SideWinder started using this second-stage technique with shellcode in October 2023.
Through careful analysis, we were able to obtain second-stage payloads, in the form of RTF files. The malicious IP
addresses used to deliver them are listed in the IoCs section of this report.
Network Infrastructure
The stage two command-and-control (C2) utilizes an old Tor node, 91[.]223.208[.]175, possibly as a means of
obfuscating network analysis. Tor, an acronym for The Onion Router, is a network that masks online traffic to provide
anonymous web browsing.
However, delivery infrastructure for the second stage can still be identified via an 8 byte file, a RTF document
returned by the C2 when outside of the geofence.
Similar domain naming structure and registration times show multiple domains ready to be used by Sidewinder.
Similarly, protective DNS (PDNS) data for the stage two C2 yields a number of targets. PDNS is a security service
that analyzes DNS queries and takes action to mitigate threats, such as preventing access to domains known to be
malicious.

Conclusion
The SideWinder threat actor continues to improve its infrastructure for targeting victims in new regions. The steady
evolution of its network infrastructure and delivery payloads suggests that SideWinder will continue its attacks in the
foreseeable future.
At the time of publication, we haven’t yet observed any samples of the JavaScript delivered in the last stage of the
attack. However, based on SideWinder's prior campaigns, we believe that the goal of this campaign is espionage and
intelligence gathering.
The BlackBerry Threat Research and Intelligence team is actively monitoring this threat group’s tooling and malicious
files. All the files and network artefacts we identified in this campaign have been listed in the Appendix below for the
benefit of defenders and cybersecurity professionals.
Countermeasures
The good news is that BlackBerry customers are protected against the SideWinder IoCs listed in this blog post by
endpoint protection solutions such as CylanceENDPOINT™.
CylanceENDPOINT leverages advanced AI to detect threats before they cause damage, minimizing business
disruptions and the costs incurred during a ransomware attack.
Additional Recommendations
Due to the abuse of CVE-2017-0199 by SideWinder in this campaign, it would be prudent for organizations to
keep all systems, especially those using Microsoft Office, current with the most recent security patches. See
Microsoft’s official Security Updates site for the relevant patches.

Phishing awareness training is a must for any organization, large or small. Employees should be taught the ‘red
flags’ of a phishing email or document, encouraged to report suspicious emails, and trained (though security
exercises if need be) not to open attachments or click on links in unsolicited documents.

In addition, we recommend implementing advanced email filtering solutions to identify and block phishing
emails that could carry malicious Word documents. Since the advent of deepfakes and generative AI, it’s
getting harder for even well-trained personnel to tell the difference between a real and a falsified
communication from what appears to be an official source.

It’s also worth considering investing in advanced threat detection and response solutions capable of real-time
threat identification and remediation, and subscribing to cyber threat intelligence services to stay up to date with
attacker tactics, techniques and procedures.
