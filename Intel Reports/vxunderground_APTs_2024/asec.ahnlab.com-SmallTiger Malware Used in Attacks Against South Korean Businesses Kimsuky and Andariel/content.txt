SmallTiger Malware Used in Attacks Against South Korean
Businesses (Kimsuky and Andariel)
By ASEC ⋮ ⋮ 6/11/2024
AhnLab SEcurity intelligence Center (ASEC) is responding to recently discovered cases that are using the SmallTiger
malware to attack South Korean businesses. The method of initial access has not yet been identified, but the threat
actor distributed SmallTiger into the companies’ systems during the lateral movement phase. South Korean defense
contractors, automobile part manufacturers, and semiconductor manufacturers are some of the confirmed targets.
The attacks were first found in November 2023, and the malware strains found inside the affected systems seemed to
indicate that the Kimsuky group was utilizing their typical method. However, instead of taking an orthodox Kimsuky
group approach, the threat actor exploited the software updater programs of the companies during the internal
propagation phase. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the backdoor malware installed at the end is DurianBeacon, a
malware strain found in Andariel’s past attack cases.
The same threat actor resumed attacks in February 2024, and the malware distributed at the end was replaced with a
downloader named SmallTiger. The malware was still being used in attacks as of May 2024.
1. DurianBeacon Attack Case
The cases of attacks using the MultiRDP malware and Meterpreter were found in November 2023. The malware
classified as MultiRDP patches the memory of the currently running remote desktop service so that multiple users
can connect with remote desktop protocol (RDP). The threat actor can utilize it to log into the affected system without
the user realizing it, and it is a method the Kimsuky group deploys. Meterpreter is a backdoor malware strain provided
by Metasploit, a penetration tester framework. It supports features similar to Cobalt Strike such as command
execution, information theft, and lateral movement that can be used to seize control of company networks.

Inside the system, another malware was installed via the company’s software updater program. The malware
installed at the end was DurianBeacon RAT, which was found in Andariel’s past attacks. In addition, the attack
technique used when distributing malware is similar to the one the Andariel group has been using.
The malware first installed during the internal propagation phase is a dropper that decrypts three files that exist in the
resource and installs them using a service named “mozillasvcone”. “%SystemDirectory%\mozillasvcone.dll”, the file
executed via the “mozillasvcone” service, loads a DLL created in the
“%SystemDirectory%\0OGPWm4uRZ0CAkHZ9o\c0FcEpj86LSNmZ5.dll” path and calls the RyXmqIUMXViyw6Uvkf()
function. “c0FcEpj86LSNmZ5.dll” reads the encrypted data files created inside the
“%SystemDirectory%\OQAuagarc0wDTo\mNyKQBP3vV4uX” path and decrypts the files to execute them inside the
memory.
The DurianBeacon that is ultimately executed in the memory is the updated version of DurianBeacon that was
mentioned in the ASEC Blog article “Analysis of Andariel’s New Attack Activities.” [1] The updated version is also
developed in the Go language and uses the SSL protocol to communicate with the C&C server.
Figure 2. Comparing the past and the present versions
Like the previous version, DurianBeacon sends the infected system’s IP information, user name, desktop name,
architecture, and file names before awaiting commands after the initial access. When a command is sent, it returns a
result. The difference is that the commands 0x10 and 0x12 were added for the roles of self-deletion and Socks Proxy.

Table 1. The list of DurianBeacon commands
It appears that the threat actor distributed DurianBeacon inside the target companies to control their inner
infrastructures after the initial access and used the malware to steal information.
2. SmallTiger Attack Case #1
Since February 2024, there have been confirmed cases in which the same threat actor abused different software in
their attack. The malware in the form of DLL is ultimately installed during the internal propagation phase. It is a
downloader that accesses the C&C server to download a payload and executes it inside the memory. The
downloader malware in this case is classified as SmallTiger based on the name of the DLL given by the developer
(threat actor).

The threat actor also installed Mimikatz and ProcDump during the infiltration stage and dumped the memory of the
LSASS process using the ProcDump tool to hijack the infected system’s credentials.

In this case, the malware that steals the information from NirSoft’s WebBrowserPassView and web browser was also
discovered. It is a command line tool similar to WebBrowserPassView in that it extracts and shows the account and
history information saved in Google Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer.

3. SmallTiger Attack Case #2
Unlike in November 2023 where the threat actor used a dropper that creates DurianBeacon, a downloader with the
same name (j******n.exe) was used in April 2024. The malware downloads a malicious JavaScript from the C&C
server using the mshta command and runs it. The downloaded JavaScript creates a payload that is included
internally at the “C:/Users/Public/printsys.dll:mdata” path—the alternate data stream (ADS) area—and runs it using
rundll32. As a result, SmallTiger is created.

In May 2024, GitHub was used instead of the usual C&C server to distribute SmallTiger. “pk.dll” is the file that is
installed at the end, and it is the SmallTiger malware just like the past attack cases.

4. Conclusion
Since November 2023, ASEC has confirmed cases of attacks targeting South Korean companies that led to
SmallTiger’s distribution. The first case used DurianBeacon—employed by the Andariel group in the past—as the
final payload, but it was found alongside malware strains that the Kimsuky group used in its previous attacks. The
attacker has been using a different strain of malware named SmallTiger since February 2024.
Users must be particularly cautious against attachments in emails from unknown sources and executable files
downloaded from web pages. Additionally, security administrators in companies must enhance the monitoring of
security programs and apply patches for any security vulnerabilities in security. Users should also apply the latest
6/7
patch for OS and programs such as Internet browsers, and update V3 to the latest version to prevent malware
infection in advance.
