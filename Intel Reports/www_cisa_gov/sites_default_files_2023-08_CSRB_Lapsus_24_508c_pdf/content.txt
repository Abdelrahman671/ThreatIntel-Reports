MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIR AND DEPUTY CHAIR 
In 1983, the movie WarGames captured the imagination of a society navigating its way towards the personal computing 
revolution. Therein, a seemingly ordinary high school student, with a keen sense of curiosity, uses esoteric magic to 
hack into the U.S. Department of Defense using just a phone line and an acoustic coupler. Having made a connection, 
he meets the AI-powered NORAD computer known as the WOPR (or Joshua). The WOPR’s primary job is running war 
simulations for the government, but Joshua also moonlights as a loveable tic-tac-toe opponent thanks to a set of easter 
eggs implanted by its creator. This moment in movie history came to mind as we took on this review, just as AI and 
large language models are being incorporated into systems globally. We see one other, more obvious, parallel: 
teenagers are compromising well-defended organizations using a creative application of many techniques. Not much 
seems to have changed in the last 40 years. Yet, we saw a clear distinction that stood in stark relief as we dove deeper 
into the details of the review: namely the vast global for-profit online criminal landscape that curious young people are 
now encountering. Everything on this front has changed significantly. 
In this review, the Board’s second, we focused on a loosely organized group of threat actors that styled itself as 
Lapsus$ for a short period of time in 2021 - 2022. Lapsus$ drew the attention of cybersecurity professionals and the 
press almost immediately after providing unparalleled transparency into the inner workings of how it targeted 
organizations and individuals, organized its attacks, and interacted within itself and with other threat groups. Its 
mindset was on full display for the world to see and Lapsus$ made clear just how easy it was for its members 
(juveniles, in some instances) to infiltrate well-defended organizations. Lapsus$ seemed to work at various times for 
notoriety, financial gain, or amusement, and blended a variety of techniques, some more complex than others, with 
flashes of creativity. But Lapsus$ did not fall into that category of threat actor that grabs most of the headlines: the 
nation-state threat actor with well-resourced offensive tactics that lurks behind the scenes for years at a time or the 
transnational ransomware groups that cost the global economy billions of dollars. In fact, Lapsus$ did not use the type 
of novel zero-day techniques the industry is used to seeing frequently in the news.  
Lapsus$ was not unique in the criminal landscape in which it operated; it had membership in common with other 
similarly motivated groups globally. But Lapsus$ was unique for its effectiveness, speed, creativity, and boldness; it 
operated in a way that gifted the Board a propitious lens through which we could see systemic issues in the digital 
ecosystem. Our attention was drawn immediately towards the identity and access management ecosystem; the way 
threat actors abused telecommunications providers; the relationships between organizations and their outsourcing 
companies; and how the law enforcement ecosystem plays a vital role in deterrence. 
Organizations must act now to protect themselves, and the Board identified tangible ways to do so, with the help of the 
U.S. government and the companies that are best prepared to provide safe-by-default solutions to uplift the whole 
ecosystem. Many of the Board’s recommendations come within the broader theme of “security by design,” reflecting 
the larger industry conversation, including the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency’s (CISA’s) Secure by 
Design1 efforts.  
We need better technologies that move us towards a passwordless world, negating the effects of credential theft. We 
need telecommunications providers to design and implement processes and systems that keep attackers from 
hijacking mobile phone service. We need to double down on zero trust architectures that assume breach. We need 
organizations to design their security programs to cover not only their own information technology environments, but 
also those of their vendors that host critical data or maintain direct network access. We need to give law enforcement 
the means to disrupt all manner of threat actors. And we need to help curious young people use their growing digital 
skills for positive purposes. The Board developed actionable recommendations for all these issues and more.  
As we reflect on our second review as an institution, we are proud that the Board has further proved this model of deep, 
after-action reviews of the most significant incidents. The recommendations are strong and specific because we were 
able to draw from the diverse expertise of the Board’s public-private membership, including law enforcement, incident 
response experts, a critical infrastructure Chief Information Security Officer, and more.

We are grateful that, among the impacted companies, several cooperated actively with the Board’s work. Their 
perspectives were critical to the insights and recommendations in this review, and their contributions highlight the 
public safety need for the Board to gather all information required to do our work effectively. We appreciate as well the 
voluntary contributions of over 30 other companies, cybersecurity firms, law enforcement organizations, security 
researchers, and academics that had insights to share. Unfortunately, some organizations that were known to have 
been impacted by Lapsus$ declined to participate in the review, limiting the Board’s opportunity to learn from a range 
of experiences that would have further enriched our work. 
Earlier this year, the Administration recommended that Congress authorize the Board and provide it with the 
appropriate authorities to ensure that the Board can gather the information needed to advise the cyber community—
voluntarily where possible, but with a limited subpoena authority as a backstop when necessary. We are hopeful that 
Congress will act quickly on this important legislation. 
We are grateful to Alejandro N. Mayorkas, Secretary of Homeland Security, for his continued belief in the important 
mission of this Board, and to Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Director Jen Easterly for commissioning 
our second review and offering CISA’s resources and support to ensure the Board could conduct its independent work. 
Finally, we give thanks to the many companies and individual experts that offered their support to this comprehensive 
review. We also express our sincere appreciation to our colleagues on the Board and the talented and dedicated staff 
that has supported its work.  
We look forward to our coming reviews. We will in the meantime continue to fortify the CSRB and its supporting 
infrastructure, for this Board has become an enduring part of our cybersecurity ecosystem as a true public-private model.

REVIEW OF THE ATTACKS ASSOCIATED WITH LAPSUS$ AND RELATED THREAT GROUPS

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Beginning in late 2021 and continuing late into 2022, a globally active, extortion-focused cyber threat actor group 
attacked dozens of well-known companies and government agencies around the world. It penetrated corporate 
networks, stole source code, demanded payments while rarely following up, lodged political messages in shadowy 
online forums, and swiftly moved on to its next targets. The cyberattacks were not the work of a nation-state actor, nor 
did they always involve particularly complex or advanced tooling or methods. Yet the attacks were consistently effective 
against some of the most well-resourced and well-defended companies in the world. These headline-grabbing incidents 
were perpetrated by a loosely organized threat actor group known as Lapsus$. Lapsus$ exploited systemic ecosystem 
weaknesses to infiltrate and extort organizations, sometimes appearing to do so for nothing more than attention and 
public notoriety.  
Lapsus$ operated against a backdrop of other criminal groups employing similar methods that were studied as part of 
this review. These groups demonstrated the still-prevalent vulnerabilities in our cyber ecosystem. They showed 
adeptness in identifying weak points in the system—like downstream vendors or telecommunications providers—that 
allowed onward access to their intended victims. They also showed a special talent for social engineering, luring a 
target’s employees to essentially open the gates to the corporate network.  
Lapsus$’s and similar groups’ success sounds a warning to organizations across the globe, shining a light on the 
fragility of our interconnected digital infrastructure. Lapsus$ exploited, to great and wide effect, a playbook of effective 
techniques, which other threat actors can also use. If richly resourced cybersecurity programs were so easily breached 
by a loosely organized threat actor group, which included several juveniles, how can organizations expect their 
programs to perform against well-resourced cybercrime syndicates and nation-state actors? The Cyber Safety Review 
Board (CSRB, or the Board) therefore focused intently on what additional security controls and improvements can bring 
needed change to the status quo.  
The Board found that the multi-factor authentication (MFA) implementations used broadly in the digital ecosystem 
today are not sufficient for most organizations or consumers. In particular, the Board saw a collective failure to 
sufficiently account for and mitigate the risks associated with using Short Message Service (SMS) and voice calls for 
MFA. In several instances, attackers gained initial access to targeted organizations through Subscriber Identity Module 
(SIM) swapping attacks, which allowed them to intercept one-time passcodes and push notifications sent via SMS, 
effectively defeating this widely used MFA control. A lucrative SIM swap criminal market further enabled this pay-for-
access to a target’s mobile phone services. Despite these factors, adopting more advanced MFA capabilities remains a 
challenge for many organizations and individual consumers due to workflow and usability issues.  
Initial access brokers (IABs) and the “infostealer” malware ecosystem—whereby anyone can buy valid login credentials 
for a target (“access as a service”)—were highly effective means of initial entry. Threat actor groups highly leveraged 
these underground markets to directly target organizations, but also targeted the organization’s third-party servicers 
and business process outsourcers (BPOs). Organizations did not always consider third parties and BPOs in their risk 
management programs.  
Lapsus$ was not successful in all its attempted attacks. The Board found that organizations with mature, defense-in-
depth controls were most resilient to these threat actor groups. Organizations that used application or token-based 
MFA methods or employed robust network intrusion detection systems, including rapid detection of suspicious account 
activity, were especially resilient. Organizations that maintained and followed their established incident response 
procedures significantly mitigated impacts. Highly effective organizations employed mechanisms such as out-of-band 
communications that allowed incident response professionals to coordinate response efforts without being monitored 
by the threat actors. 
Through extensive efforts, international law enforcement eventually apprehended several of the perpetrators. Yet, 
those and similar United States (U.S.) government cybersecurity efforts remain unnecessarily hamstrung. In general, 
law enforcement remains underfunded for resource- and data-intensive investigations and disruptions against the full 
breadth of cyber threat actors. Similarly, chronic underreporting from the private sector of threats or incidents hampers 
the federal government’s ability to warn other targeted entities, recommend mitigation measures, take down malicious 
infrastructure, seize ill-gotten cryptocurrency or fiat currency, bring those responsible to justice, or otherwise disrupt 
malicious activity. 
 
REVIEW OF THE ATTACKS ASSOCIATED WITH LAPSUS$ AND RELATED THREAT GROUPS 
 
v 
 
In this review, the Board learned that some of the perpetrators were teenagers. In several jurisdictions, a perpetrator’s 
juvenile status can yield lighter penalties and less severe consequences that may encourage young cybercriminals to 
re-offend. The Board also noted that while the United Kingdom and the Netherlands have nascent efforts to create 
pathways for steering talented young hackers away from cybercrime, similar community prevention programs do not 
exist in the U.S. Resourcing both law enforcement and intervention efforts needs rebalancing. 
KEY RECOMMENDATIONS 
The Board recommends that organizations urgently implement improved access controls and authentication methods 
and transition away from voice and SMS-based MFA; those methods are particularly vulnerable. Instead, organizations 
should adopt easy-to-use, secure-by-default, passwordless solutions such as Fast IDentity Online (FIDO)2-compliant, 
phishing-resistant MFA methods. Device and software manufacturers will need to innovate and deliver effective 
solutions that the global digital ecosystem can quickly adopt. To facilitate the transition to passwordless authentication, 
the Board recommends that the federal government develop and promote a secure authentication roadmap for the 
nation. The roadmap should include standards, frameworks, guidance, tools, and technology that can enable 
organizations to assess, progress, and implement leading practices for passwordless authentication.  
The Board also calls attention to the risks introduced through use of mobile devices for authentication and urges 
telecommunications providers to mitigate risk through technological, process, and oversight measures. Carriers should 
implement more stringent authentication methods for SIM swapping to continue enabling legitimate business 
processes while introducing more friction to discourage malicious actors. The Board recommends that carriers mitigate 
retail point-of-sale vulnerabilities by improving asset management. For example, carriers can develop methods to detect 
and mitigate theft and abuse of point-of-sale devices and tablets by remotely wiping the devices. Carriers can also 
implement zero trust architecture concepts in retail stores. To this end, technology providers and developers should 
also harden their applications and application programing interfaces (APIs) by applying industry best practices for 
sensitive assets. 
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) should engage in oversight and 
regulatory activities to standardize best practices and combat SIM swapping within the telecommunications industry. 
The Board recommends that the FCC and FTC strengthen their oversight and enforcement activities focused on SIM-
swapping by encouraging regular reporting by telecommunications providers regarding fraudulent SIM swapping 
prevalence, documenting and enforcing best practices, and incentivizing better security at telecommunications 
providers.  
The Board also recommends that organizations prioritize resiliency and fast recovery to defend against these kinds of 
attacks. Planning efforts need to extend to third-party suppliers, including BPOs. Organizations should plan for 
disruptive cyber intrusions by requiring their whole business (including outside sources) to invest in prevention, 
detection, response, and recovery capabilities. This includes developing and implementing modern enterprise network 
architectures, developing and testing a cyber incident response plan, communicating with law enforcement and federal 
response officials, and conducting after-action reviews on incidents.  
Organizations should incorporate cybersecurity requirements into contract language and require that third-party service 
providers and BPOs adhere to similar standards as the company. Furthermore, BPOs should establish information 
sharing relationships with their industry peers and the federal government should support the maturation of this 
approach.  
Finally, the Board recommends the advancement of “whole-of-society” programs and mechanisms to prevent juvenile 
cybercrime. Congress should explore funding juvenile cybercrime prevention programs, fostering interruption and 
redirection programs, and reducing criminal incentives by exploring ways to ensure continuity between federal and 
state law enforcement authorities.

METHODOLOGY 
The Board engaged with nearly 40 organizations and individuals, including representatives from threat intelligence firms, 
incident response organizations, targeted organizations, international law enforcement, as well as individual researchers 
and subject matter experts. The engagements comprised a mixture of interviews and written responses to requests for 
information, in addition to reviewing publicly available information from approximately 130 unique sources. See Appendix 
A for a list of participating organizations. 
Throughout its review, the Board prioritized the use of primary sources, namely those with first-hand observations such as 
targeted organizations and threat intelligence subject matter experts. Given the unique nature of how the threat actor 
groups operated in view of the public, the Board found it appropriate to leverage media coverage and industry blogs, as 
they provided a valuable archive of perceived attacker movements and events. 
The Board is grateful for all the contributions, which helped build the timeline of events, corroborate facts, and develop 
recommendations. The proceeding sections of the report—Facts, Findings, and Recommendations—detail the attacks and 
their impact, and offer lessons learned that can be applied to any public or private sector organization (domestic or 
foreign).  
SCOPE OF INQUIRY 
Lapsus$ was a loosely organized threat actor group that operated against a backdrop of a broader criminal ecosystem, 
with which it regularly interacted in a fluid and dynamic way. For this reason, threat intelligence experts experienced 
challenges consistently attributing particular attacks to specific threat actor groups rather than others. Therefore, the 
Board opened the aperture of its inquiry and looked at reasonably adjacent attack activity that may be attributed to a 
broader set of threat actors. Similarly, the Board did not attempt to rectify the conflicting views of experts on threat actor 
naming conventions nor attempt to conclusively attribute any attacks to Lapsus$, preferring instead to focus on the in-
common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that would allow companies and individuals to better protect 
themselves against similar attacks. Accordingly, the report uses the term “threat actors” or "this class of threat actors” to 
refer to the superset of group activity the Board studied. 
WORKING WITH TARGETED ORGANIZATIONS 
The Board engaged targeted organizations directly to understand how they approached incident response and post-
incident mitigation. The Board selected specific organizations to engage based upon public disclosures the organizations 
had previously made. Several of these organizations generously shared their insights with the Board, which 
complemented the information provided by experts, including threat intelligence firms and law enforcement. Although 
some organizations did not agree to participate in the Board’s review, the Board believes it was able to obtain enough 
information to conduct a meaningful review and deliver strong recommendations that will have a meaningful impact on 
the cybersecurity ecosystem. 
In conducting this review, the Board remained committed to its Core Principles,2 namely, conducting an objective, 
forward-looking review. As such, this report does not reference targeted organizations by name unless doing so was 
specifically approved by that organization or where a public reference such as a news article or indictment was available. 
This approach is consistent with the President’s National Cyber Strategy, which is rooted in collaboration between 
industry and government to minimize harm from cyber incidents.

REVIEW OF THE ATTACKS ASSOCIATED WITH LAPSUS$ AND RELATED THREAT GROUPS

1. FACTS 
Lapsus$ emerged in 2021 within a broad ecosystem of cybercriminal activity, conducting extortion-focused attacks 
against a wide range of targets. The group gained notoriety because it successfully attacked well-defended 
organizations using highly effective social engineering; targeted supply chains by compromising business process 
outsourcing (BPOs) and telecommunications providers; and used its public Telegram channel to discuss its operations, 
targets, and successes, and even to communicate with and extort its targets. 
1.1. 
THE THREAT ACTORS  
Lapsus$ was a transnational group3 of threat actors based mainly in the United Kingdom (U.K.) and Brazil,4 with 8 to 
10 known members as of April 2022.5 By some accounts, it formed out of members from two earlier cybercriminal 
groups known as Cyberteam6 and Recursion Team.7 Consistent with the group’s own statements,8 the Cyber Safety 
Review Board (CSRB, or the Board) received no evidence suggesting Lapsus$ was affiliated with a nation-state or 
political entity. In general, the threat intelligence community first observed and tracked Lapsus$ as a named group 
between September and December 2021, which is when the group first posted on its public Telegram channel and 
attacked South American targets before pivoting to infiltrate many well-known international companies.9, 10 However, 
some researchers identified individuals using the Lapsus$ moniker in forums to claim credit for alleged attacks as early 
as June 2021,11, 12 indicating that the group or its members may have been active prior to the fall. Additionally, security 
researchers observed suspected Lapsus$ Telegram activity in March 2022 when a channel belonging to another 
extortion group reposted content from the official Lapsus$ Telegram channel.13 However, confirmation of Lapsus$ 
involvement was not verified, and the Board saw no other apparent connection between the two groups.  
Although Lapsus$ as a named group does not appear to be active at the time of this report,14 the Board cannot rule out 
the possibility that Lapsus$ members and affiliates have decided to limit their public profile, join other cybercrime 
groups, or rebrand.15 As the Board cannot be definitive about the current existence of Lapsus$, for simplicity, this 
report refers to Lapsus$ in the past tense. 
Lapsus$ operated against the backdrop of a dynamic ecosystem of threat actors, each having specific tactics, 
preferring certain target sectors, malware, or methodology. Within this threat ecosystem, Lapsus$ emerged with 
different approaches to targeting, credential theft, and direct interaction with the public. For example, Lapsus$ used its 
private and public Telegram channels as a primary communication platform for operational coordination and

engagement with its tens of thousands of followers, sharing efforts to recruit insiders at target companies, announcing 
its attacks, and taking polls on whom to target next.16, 17, 18 
Security researchers have faced challenges delineating Lapsus$ activity from that of other threat actor groups. The 
relative commonality of their attack techniques and the connections between Lapsus$ members and those in other 
threat actor groups have resulted in fragmented threat intelligence reporting and attribution.19 Some of these groups 
have provable ties to one another,20 but the specifics of any individual relationships are difficult to determine. Due to 
the fluid and overlapping nature of observed activity, the Board increased the aperture of study, and thusly, this report 
also includes some activities attributed by experts to other threat groups, including those named below. 
• 
Yanluowang: Broadly identified as a ransomware affiliate group that is reported to have some connection with 
Lapsus$ members.21 The group was active as of August 2021 and targeted organizations in the financial, 
manufacturing, information technology (IT), consultancy, and engineering sectors.22 
• 
0ktapus or Roasted 0ktapus: A financially motivated group that is focused on accessing corporate services, 
obtaining crypto-related account information,23 and stealing source code.24 
• 
Karakurt: A data extortion group25 known for operating a dedicated leak site to auction stolen data.26 
• 
Nwgen Team: A financially motivated group that split off from Lapsus$ mid-2022 and blended its original 
tradecraft with additional use of ransomware.27  
• 
#NotLapsus: Two other unidentified groups, #NotLapsus1 and #NotLapsus2, which have successful alliances 
with Lapsus$ members and other cybercriminals, such as Yanluowang.28 
This report uses the term “threat actors” or "this class of threat actors” to refer to this superset of group activity the 
Board studied, referring specifically by name to any one group only where relevant. 
1.1.1. Motivation  
Many security researchers attribute the primary motive of the broader set of threat actors studied for this report as 
financial in nature, based on observed activity that involved selling stolen data on underground criminal markets,29 use

of extortion and ransomware to coerce money out of targeted organizations,30 theft of cryptocurrency,31 and even 
cryptocurrency mining in a few cases.32 
However, researchers hold a diverse range of opinions on Lapsus$’s motivations. While the group claimed publicly that 
its only motivation was profit, other plausible motivations appear to include notoriety, amusement, and ideology.33, 34 
Security researchers noted that successfully attacking highly visible targets, including publicly shaming them, generally 
enabled Lapsus$ to expand its reputation and credibility in the cybercriminal environment.35 At the same time, 
Lapsus$’s activity in many of these attacks was consistent with ideological motives. For example, publicly visible chats 
suggest radical opposition to Brazilian health policies during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, 
which may explain targeting of the Brazilian Ministry of Health in December 2021.36 The Board did not receive 
information determining whether these possible differences in motivation were due to the interests of different group 
members or individual members conducting independent campaigns attributed to the whole group. 
1.2. 
TACTICS, TECHNIQUES, AND PROCEDURES (TTPs) 
The threat actors described in this report leveraged a wide diversity of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), 
described by researchers as often mixing both non-complex methods and tools with advanced technical knowledge.37, 
38 The threat actors initiated some attacks by employing common phishing methods or leveraging stolen credentials, 
which they purchased from initial access brokers (IABs).39 Other attacks demonstrated a deeper familiarity with a 
target’s business and engineering workflows.40 
Generally, the threat actors did not deploy custom tools, preferring well-known tools built by others41 or “living off the 
land” (LOTL).42 The speed of the attacks and the use of different tools and techniques were notable and, in some 
cases, appeared automated.43 
The following sections outline some of the notable TTPs threat actors used as they worked across the aggregated set of 
targeted entities and are provided here to support the findings and recommendations below. Where possible, 
descriptions of attack techniques are aligned to the MITRE ATT&CK® Framework taxonomy.44 
1.2.1. Reconnaissance and Resource Development 
The Reconnaissance and Resource Development stages of an attack involve activities such as gathering intelligence 
and information about a target system or network, then establishing resources to support operations.

The threat actors used a variety of well-understood research methods on targets of interest to identify weaknesses that 
they could exploit. For example, they used social engineering to increase their understanding of a target’s business 
operations, including information about personnel, structure, and crisis response procedures.45 They also probed 
networks using standard penetration testing methods, such as port scanning, to find vulnerable external services.46 
Evidence also suggests that the threat actors solicited login credentials on underground criminal forums and, in the 
case of Lapsus$, this also occurred in its public Telegram channel.47, 48 
Attacker Infrastructure 
The threat actors used a variety of systems to launch and control their attacks, which included infrastructure for 
command-and-control (C2) servers and destination points for exfiltrated data.49, 50 Some of the threat groups used 
dedicated cloud infrastructure from known virtual service providers (VSPs), enabling the group to stage, launch, and 
execute an operation rapidly.51 In some cases, threat actors reused infrastructure across multiple targeted 
organizations, including Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and server-side components like web shells,52, 53 making 
attribution tracking across intrusions more straightforward. Threat researchers understand these tactics well; the threat 
actors did not appear to introduce any novel capabilities in this regard.  
To mask its attack traffic, the threat group attempted to use anonymization services like Tor to connect to targeted 
networks, but then in some instances established new virtual private network (VPN) sessions through residential IP 
addresses to appear less suspicious.54 Commercial VPN services such as NordVPN served a similar purpose by 
allowing the threat actors to select servers in similar geographic locations to their targets to avoid security detections 
such as “impossible travel” signals (activity from disparate locations between which travel in a given timeframe is 
humanly impossible).55, 56, 57 
Emergency Disclosure Request (EDR) Abuse 
Several of the threat actors studied for this report, and in particular some members of Lapsus$, used fraudulent 
Emergency Disclosure Requests (EDRs) to obtain sensitive information about targets that could be used to develop 
extortion attacks against targeted individuals, for example by taking over their online accounts to access personal 
photos. The use of fraudulent EDRs for this purpose is a known tactic, although it is still a relatively recent development 
in the criminal underground.58 Underlining the scope of this issue, the Board learned that security researchers are 
tracking at least 112 domains, including those belonging to international law enforcement agencies, that attackers 
have used to disseminate fraudulent EDRs.59

Fraudulent EDRs 
18 United States Code (U.S.C.) § 2702 enables service providers to immediately respond to governmental entity 
requests of an emergency nature, i.e., EDRs, to address immediate life-safety issues in the interest of the public. 
Governmental entities make these requests directly to service providers, which detail their procedures for receiving 
requests on their website.60 Providers may also decide to divulge records if they learn about an emergency through 
another source, such as a concerned parent. Attackers can exploit this method of requesting data to create fake 
requests by impersonating law enforcement agents and other requestors, for example by embedding official police 
logos and crests into their requests.61 
1.2.2. Use of Supply Chain Attacks 
Many of the threat actors covered in this study extensively exploited the trust relationships between third-party service 
providers and their clients or customers to develop attacks against the downstream entity.62, 63, 64 Since 2019, the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has observed a wide variety of threat actor groups targeting suppliers in this 
way.65 The Board saw discernable patterns in the targeting of three specific sectors for this purpose: BPOs; 
telecommunications providers; and software as a service (SaaS) providers. 
Business Process Outsourcing Companies (BPOs) 
BPOs are involved in providing scaled operations to organizations, operating as a third-party supplier, which enables 
their clients to focus on core competencies while gaining overall cost efficiencies.66 These services may include 
extended workforce staffing for customer and technical support, data entry, security services, software development, 
and many others. Due to their role in their clients’ business, and the access required to carry out the necessary 
operations, BPOs are an attractive consolidation point for threat actors looking to compromise multiple downstream 
targeted organizations.67 The threat actors outlined in this report targeted multiple BPOs in this way.  
Telecommunications Providers 
Telecommunications providers, and in particular mobile phone operators, provide critical infrastructure for the nation, 
and in recent years have become pivotal in the adoption of multi-factor authentication (MFA) by facilitating the delivery 
of one-time passcodes (OTPs) via Short Message Service (SMS) and voice calls. The threat actors outlined in this report 
made use of compromised access to telecommunications provider infrastructure, business processes, and accounts to 
hijack these OTPs.68  
Third-Party Service Providers 
While the use of third-party service providers, such as SaaS, in enterprise has grown in popularity,69 the federation of 
enterprise data and capabilities into these cloud-based platforms comes with security risks that industry may not

always manage.70 The threat actors studied for this report are aware of the third-party service provider business trends 
and the relationship those providers have with their customers, and exploited those partnerships to gain access to their 
customer data and systems.  
Case Study in Supply Chain Attacks 
In January 2022, a threat actor studied for this report gained access to privileged internal tools of a third-party 
service provider by compromising the computer of a customer support contractor from one of its BPOs. The real 
target of this attack was not the third-party service provider, nor the BPO, but rather the downstream customers of 
the service provider itself. This is a remarkable example of a creative three-stage supply chain attack used by this 
class of threat actors.71 
1.2.3. Initial Access 
The initial access stages of an attack provide an attacker with a foothold through which they can facilitate further 
activity. This may involve a variety of techniques to compromise systems, software, identities, or network access. 
Social Engineering 
Social engineering was used extensively, and creatively, by most of the threat actors to gain initial access to their 
targets. The ability to effectively leverage direct contact with employees throughout the lifecycle of the attack, using a 
wide range of techniques, and in multiple languages, was a hallmark of this class of threat actor.72 Some 
characterizations and examples are provided below for illustration.  
• 
Threat actors used publicly available data about targets, including employee profile pictures, department 
structures, business processes, workflows, and business relationships, to impersonate legitimate personnel.73 
• 
Threat actors used spear-phishing that had target employees visit spoofed or hacked websites. These sites 
tricked employees and contractors into entering their usernames and passwords into the attacker-controlled 
website.74 In other cases, these websites were backed by toolkits such as Evilginx2 that passively stole login 
credentials and session tokens.75 
• 
Threat actors used voice phishing (vishing) to impersonate a trusted entity over voice. Information gathered 
during the reconnaissance phase of the attack, including answers to security questions, helped threat actors to 
convince support desk employees to reset account credentials over the phone.76  
• 
Threat actors used SMS phishing (smishing) to deliver instructions or website links via SMS to a victim’s phone. 
These messages often contained links to seemingly legitimate domains, such as a similar website address, 
containing user login fields but were instead used by threat actors to harvest user credentials.77

• 
Threat actors used MFA fatigue, spamming employees with MFA prompts with the goal of overwhelming them 
with access approval requests until they said yes. Sometimes these prompts occurred late at night, or during 
inconvenient times,78 possibly to increase the likelihood of the employee accepting the prompt.  
• 
In a few cases, the threat actor impersonated help desk personnel over direct chat messages and encouraged 
employees to approve the MFA prompts.79  
• 
Threat actors convinced employees to navigate to credential-harvesting websites or download remote 
monitoring and management (RMM) tools, allowing the threat actor to remotely connect and control the 
target’s system.80 
Hijacking Delivery of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Passcodes 
During its research, the Board heard about threat actors’ ability to exploit SMS and voice MFA through fraudulent 
Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) swaps, as depicted in Figure 1. SIM swapping, a generally benign business process 
that enables mobile phone customers to switch their phone number to new devices was especially pertinent to this 
review. Threat actors can abuse this business process to fraudulently activate an attacker-controlled SIM with the 
victim’s phone number. This enables the threat actor to intercept SMS and voice calls and receive MFA-related 
messages that control access to online accounts.81  
 
Figure 1 - Example of a Fraudulent SIM Swap 
To execute fraudulent SIM swaps, Lapsus$ obtained basic information about its victims, such as their name, phone 
number, and customer proprietary network information (CPNI). Lapsus$ learned the information through a variety of 
ways, including issuing fraudulent EDRs and using account takeover techniques, to hijack the accounts of 
telecommunications provider employees and contractors. It then performed fraudulent SIM swaps via the 
telecommunications provider’s customer management tools.82, 83 After executing the fraudulent SIM swaps, Lapsus$ 
took over online accounts via sign-in and account recovery workflows that sent one-time links or MFA passcodes via 
SMS or voice calls.84, 85

REVIEW OF THE ATTACKS ASSOCIATED WITH LAPSUS$ AND RELATED THREAT GROUPS

Impact of Fraudulent SIM Swaps on National Security 
Threat actor groups persistently targeted telecommunications providers of United States (U.S.) federal employees to 
gain access to internal tools that would enable convenient SIM swapping (for hijacking MFA pass codes). In one case 
Lapsus$ targeted one U.S. telecommunications providers and attempted to use this illegitimate access to 
compromise mobile phone accounts associated with FBI and Department of Defense (DOD) personnel.86 This was 
unsuccessful due to extra protections on these accounts. While the Board did not learn of any nexus between this 
particular threat actor group and nation-state threat actors, the tactics and techniques shown here would be easily 
adaptable for any threat actor wishing to target U.S. national security interests. 
Insider Recruitment 
Some of the threat actors used monetary incentives to recruit employees and contractors of targeted organizations, 
who then took actions on behalf of the threat actors. This included handing over access credentials to the threat actor, 
approving upstream MFA requests, and performing actions directly for the attacker using their internal company 
access. Lapsus$ posted advertisements offering sums of money for access to targeted systems. For access to several 
telecommunications providers, the group offered as much as United States Dollars (USD) 20,000 per week to conduct 
SIM swaps.87, 88  
Vulnerability Exploitation to Gain Initial Access 
A limited set of the threat actors exploited known software and configuration vulnerabilities to gain initial access. As 
threat actors discovered potential vulnerabilities and identified targets using tools such as Shodan,89, 90 they 
sometimes circulated the information in online forums, allowing several additional threat actors to take advantage of 
the exposure. All the observed vulnerabilities during this study were well known, with patched software available; 
security researchers observed no use of novel or "zero-day” vulnerabilities.91, 92 Some notable examples of these 
vulnerabilities are provided below for illustrative purposes. 
• 
Exploitation of a vulnerability in ForgeRock OpenAM (Common Vulnerability and Exposure [CVE]-2021-35464) 
allowed a threat actor to get initial access and elevate privileges within the victim cloud environment.93 
• 
Exploitation of a well-known vulnerability in WSO2 servers (CVE-2022-29464) enabled one of the threat actors 
to upload its tools and web shells to a targeted server to establish persistence.94, 95 
Initial Access Brokers (IABs) 
IABs are part of a broader criminal ecosystem involved in the theft and sale of access to targeted networks (“access as 
a service”). They use a variety of techniques to obtain this access, including those outlined in this report: social 
engineering; recruiting insiders; malware (“malware as a service”); scanning for open remote services with guessable 
passwords; exploiting vulnerabilities; and selling password database dumps from breaches. IABs obtain access, for 
 
86 Evidence for this comes from screenshots taken by the threat actors and shared privately between themselves. These private chats were 
observed by a journalist and reported in publication. The Board chose to include this specific article as part of overall review of the facts, as 
it provided deeper insight into how Lapsus$ operated. Source: Krebs, Brian; Krebs on Security, “Leaked Chats Show LAPSUS$ Stole T-

example via an affiliate model, and then sell it in online forums.96 The threat actors studied in this report leveraged 
IABs in some cases to gain access to targeted networks, including paying with cryptocurrency that had been stolen or 
extorted from other targets. 
1.2.4. Privilege Escalation, Lateral Movement, Persistence 
Once an attacker has initial access to a system, the foothold is typically used to elevate privileges, laterally move to 
desired areas of a victim’s systems, and establish long-term access (persistence). 
To perform reconnaissance of the network and facilitate privileged access, the threat actors exploited the tendency for 
enterprises and their employees to document internal procedures, share information on collaboration platforms, and 
use ticketing systems to perform internal help desk operations. In some cases, they impersonated employees, including 
help desk and administrator personnel, and conducted social engineering attacks. They scanned systems, searched 
information repositories, and exploited vulnerabilities to raise privileges.97, 98 An overview of some notable techniques 
is outlined in the sections below. 
Privilege Escalation via Improperly Stored Passwords and Keys 
A prevalent method of escalating privilege seen across the organizations involved the threat actors searching for, and 
exploiting, situations where the organization had improperly secured credentials. This enabled them to use legitimate 
credentials to further their attack goals, which had the added benefit of appearing to be legitimate user behavior in the 
forensic record. Examples included: 
• 
administrative passwords documented in a spreadsheet;99 
• 
Amazon Web Services (AWS) access keys stored in Slack;100 
• 
sensitive data stored in collaborative platforms, code repositories, and communication channels;101  
• 
processes for accessing source code stored in enterprise knowledge shares;102 
• 
privileged credentials embedded in a PowerShell script, stored on a misconfigured network share;103 and 
• 
credentials from password databases, browser password caches, and keychains.104, 105 
Privilege Escalation and Lateral Movement using Common Tools 
The threat actors leveraged initial and privileged access to further elevate access and laterally move to other systems. 
A mix of system utilities, diagnostic extensions, administrative databases, and malicious tools was used.106, 107 The

REVIEW OF THE ATTACKS ASSOCIATED WITH LAPSUS$ AND RELATED THREAT GROUPS 
 
10 
 
following is not an exhaustive list of all techniques used across the threat actor groups but is a representative sample 
to show the extensive understanding of post-compromise exploitation techniques known to this threat actor community. 
Examples included: 
• 
deploying credential dumping using tools such as MiniDump and Impacket, as well as other offensive security 
tools like Cobalt Strike, PowerSploit,108 Metasploit,109 and LinPEAS;110, 111 
• 
abusing Windows “ntdsutil.exe” utility to dump NT Directory Services (NTDS),112 a Windows credential 
database, to extract credentials used in the targeted environment, and administrative tools like RustScan113 
and AdFind;114 
• 
leveraging internal communication channels, such as internal Slack, to impersonate employees and conduct 
internal social engineering attacks;115  
• 
using built-in cloud diagnostic extensions to back up virtual machines (VMs) and collect logs from systems;116 
and  
• 
using compromised AWS tokens to request and assume permissions of an instance role and creating 
temporary credentials for non-existent users with open source cloud management tools like AWS_consoler.117 
Privilege Escalation by Exploiting Vulnerabilities 
In some cases, the threat actors leveraged well-known vulnerabilities to elevate privileges in critical systems. Examples 
include: 
• 
exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities in Microsoft’s Active Directory (AD);118 specific to Lapsus$, an estimated 
40-60% of compromises involved exploitation of AD;119 
• 
exploiting Microsoft Exchange Servers using ProxyShell attacks, which leverage three known CVEs: CVE-2021-
34473; CVE-2021-34523; and CVE-2021-31207;120, 121

REVIEW OF THE ATTACKS ASSOCIATED WITH LAPSUS$ AND RELATED THREAT GROUPS 
 
11 
 
• 
exploiting vulnerabilities against Windows User Profile Service to escalate local privileges, including CVE-2021-
34484122 and CVE-2022-21919;123 
• 
leveraging lateral movement techniques to abuse weaknesses in Windows environments with hashed 
credentials, such as pass-the-hash attacks;124, 125 and 
• 
exploiting vulnerabilities in Confluence, JIRA, and GitLab to obtain privileged access to information.126  
Persistence via Threat Actor-Added Resources 
The threat actors created and maintained access and administrative privileges by adding their own accounts and 
devices to the targeted organization’s environment. Examples include: 
• 
adding an administrator account using the built-in Windows “net.exe,” then adding it to the local Administrators 
group;127 
• 
registering attacker-controlled devices for MFA and modifying settings to possibly disable or register their own 
MFA during an intrusion;128 and 
• 
creating new accounts within the target’s cloud infrastructure.129 
Persistence via Legitimate and Malicious Remote Access Tools 
Some of the threat actors established persistence in the targeted environment for ongoing access, but this was not a 
consistent practice across all groups. Methods included the use of legitimate utilities, remote access administration 
tools, and malware. Some threat actors had access to more advanced toolkits than others. The following is not an 
exhaustive list, but the examples cited below show the breadth of capability generally available to this threat actor 
community. Examples include: 
• 
using stolen employee credentials to log into virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) environments such as 
Citrix;130 
• 
deploying reverse Secure Shell Protocol (SSH) tunnels to establish communication with an attacker controlled 
C2 server;131 
• 
leveraging reverse proxy tools, including rsocx132 and ngrok;133

• 
installing or using stolen employee credentials to log into a target’s RMM tools like RealVNC,134 Remote 
Desktop Protocol (RDP), ManageEngine, AnyDesk, LogMeIn, TeamViewer, and ThinScale;135, 136 
• 
implanting simple backdoors via commands sent in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) that communicated via 
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP);137 and 
• 
deploying malicious Remote Access Trojans (RATs) such as Quasar RAT.138 
Disabling Security Monitoring Tools 
Several threat actors studied for this report intentionally bypassed or disabled usage of enterprise security solutions to 
either hide their presence or facilitate further access. Some notable examples are that threat actors: 
• 
used “Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver” (BYOVD) attacks to deploy malicious kernel drivers signed by stolen 
code-signing certificates (obtained from another targeted entity) to bypass security detection and disable 
security controls;139 
• 
modified the host firewall, for example to allow RDP connections;140 and 
• 
used a Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) bootkit called “BlackLotus.”141 
1.3. 
IMPACT 
The threat actors stole proprietary data, extorted organizations, disrupted services, and harassed individuals. Due to 
the dynamic and ongoing nature of the attacks described in this report, and the threat actors’ ongoing extended 
influence and impact within the broader criminal ecosystem, quantifying the impact of their attacks with a high level of 
specificity is difficult. The sections below provide examples of some of the identifiable impacts that these attacks had 
on organizations and their employees and customers. 
1.3.1. Data Compromise and Theft 
In many instances, attackers compromised and stole data that would be most useful to them for extortion, ransom, or 
harassment purposes, or to sell later on criminal forums. This included intellectual property for marquis high-profile 
software products, user data, and other data types that were leveraged in further attacks. However, in some cases, 
attacks appeared to reflect a “smash-and-grab” approach that seemed to prioritize speed over strategy and sometimes

139 Code-signing certificates are used to establish the legitimate creator and distributor of software. By signing malware with a stolen code-
signing certificate, the code can appear as legitimate to the system and any security related software. In this instance the, signed malware 
was used in combination with CVE-2015-2291 to “use the privileged driver space provided by the vulnerable Intel driver to overwrite specific 
routines in the CrowdStrike Falcon sensor driver with adversary-created trampoline code.” CrowdStrike also observed threat actors using this 
technique to bypass other endpoint tools. Source: Intelligence Team; CrowdStrike, “SCATTERED SPIDER Exploits Windows Security

accessed individual user accounts at cryptocurrency exchanges and stole cryptocurrency holdings.163 
1.3.2. Extortion and Ransoms 
Threat actor groups frequently attempted to extort organizations and ransom stolen data. However, the effectiveness of 
these coercion techniques is difficult to quantify. Threat actor groups demanded payment directly by communicating 
with the targeted organizations, but these attempts were uneven in their approach, with some being posted publicly to 
embarrass or harass the target, or poorly coordinated in their demands for payments and deadlines. 
The effectiveness of extortion as a technique and whether the threat actors monetarily gained from their attempts is 
unclear. The Board spoke with targeted companies, threat intelligence firms, and law enforcement, and while 
ransomware attacks are widely acknowledged to have been lucrative in the past,164 interviewees expressed no clear 
consensus on how much, if any, money was ever paid to any of the threat actors to alleviate extortion. In fact, FBI 
reported that it was not aware of Lapsus$ selling stolen data, nor had it found evidence that anyone ever paid ransoms. 
However, FBI has not ruled out the possibility that some paid ransoms without informing law enforcement.165 This 
contrasts with other experts that observed Lapsus$ extorting organizations with some paying ransoms.166 
The following examples enumerate public reporting, attacker claims, and authorized disclosures to the Board for 
inclusion in this report. This is not an exhaustive list but demonstrates the breadth of experiences shared across 
targeted organizations. 
• 
Threat actors attempted to extort one technology company by threatening to release its confidential and

Threat actors attempted to extort a company with different demands, which had different amounts and 
deadlines. The attempts coincided with the threat actors posting stolen source code for an online auction.172 
• 
Threat actors attempted to extort a gaming company (over email) to negotiate a potential ransom for an 
unspecified amount.173 The threat actors also offered to the sell the company’s source code for a well-known

• 
Threat actors defaced a media company’s website with a ransom note, though it did not demand a specific 
amount.177 
1.3.3. Network and Service Disruptions 
Some of the threat actors, and Lapsus$ in particular, made use of disruptive and destructive techniques to bring 
negative attention to organizations and force public admissions of attacks, potentially as an angle on extortion 
attempts.178, 179 In most instances, damage to resources occurred before organizations knew about the attack, giving 
threat actors the means to create a crisis.180

• 
Threat actors destroyed cloud environments, including mass deletion of VMs, storage, and configurations.184 
• 
Threat actors disrupted a gaming company’s online games, systems, and services.185 
• 
Threat actors disabled the website and several internal systems of a non-U.S. agency, including resources 
related to the nation’s immunization program and issuance of digital vaccination certificates.186 The attack 
rendered the website dysfunctional and resulted in significant data loss, including the deletion of the country’s 
entire COVID-19 vaccination records database.187 
1.3.4. Harassment 
Multiple organizations and individuals involved in responding to the attacks experienced varying levels of personal 
harassment from some of the threat actors, with an intent to retaliate, halt investigations, or silence researchers.  
A technology company reported that it was now tracking several groups as part of a new class of cybercriminal threat 
that has added targeted harassment to its toolbox and observed them targeting incident response professionals and 
their family members.188 Some experts view this as an escalation in violence that is the result of cybercrime gangs 
competing for dominance.189 
The seriousness of this activity ranged from mischief to dangerous behavior. Lapsus$ was known to join and monitor 
an organization’s incident response channels, and in one instance took over a screen share and deleted resources live 
in front of the victim. Similarly, Lapsus$ publicly posted screenshots of victim environments190 to demonstrate their 
access.191 On the more serious end of this behavior, loosely affiliated threat actors threatened and harassed security 
professionals by publishing their personal information online, i.e., doxing,192 and pestered targeted organizations’ 
employees on Keybase, Twitter, and other online forums.193 The Board also heard of a subset of threat actors that 
recruited forum members to hijack cybersecurity professionals’ online accounts,194 and conducted swatting attacks195 
against them and their families.196 This demonstrates the potentially serious physical threat these groups posed. 
1.4. 
PRIVATE SECTOR RESPONSE AND MITIGATION 
Private sector organizations experienced varying levels of success in incident response and mitigation. However, 
organizations that prepared incident response and mitigation plans reported better recovery outcomes against 
incidents involving Lapsus$.197, 198 At times, organizations simultaneously had to manage an active attack on their 
internal systems and harassment from the threat actor in public settings. In general, most organizations found they

needed to adapt their existing incident response procedures and implement new security controls rapidly, adjusting to 
the dynamism of the threat actors. The following sections outline some of these measures. 
1.4.1. Operational Security 
Organizations initiated stricter security controls and communication strategies to limit future and ongoing accessibility 
by threat actors. One victim company enhanced its operational security by prohibiting bring-your-own-device (BYOD) 
usage in high-risk areas of the enterprise and selectively granting employees access to necessary resources.199 Some 
organizations also made use of “out-of-band communications” (any alternative system or technology that allows 
communication separate from the primary channel),200 an incident response procedure best established ahead of 
attacks,201 to improve response operations by prohibiting threat actors from observing incident response 
communications and activities or taunting response teams.202, 203, 204 
1.4.2. Disruption and Security Posture 
Organizations adjusted their security posture to eradicate the threat actor from their environment and prevent re-entry. 
Authentication, employee verification, and access weaknesses combined to create a central theme in how the threat 
actors targeted organizations. The following section outlines some of the measures that organizations employed to 
mitigate the attack impact mid- and post-attack. 
Mitigations were often disruptive to the organization’s business operations as changes were rolled out rapidly or took 
critical business resources offline. In some situations, organizations needed to shut down resources to mitigate the 
attack. However, they sometimes did not know which resources they could safely take offline. Organizations needed to 
update their system inventories and document their architectures before completely understanding which systems they 
could safely shut down.205 As events unfolded, one organization with existing security monitoring processes identified 
the issue and moved to respond, for example by disabling affected and potentially affected tools and locking down its 
codebase to prevent potential code changes.206  
After threat actors gained access to corporate credentials and bypassed MFA to access victim systems, one 
organization took steps, such as conducting enterprise-wide password resets207 while another required all employees 
to re-authenticate after restoring internal tool access.208 An organization also disabled global SMS one-time passwords 
(OTP), enabled an ability for employees to flag suspected false authentication requests, and only allowed MFA that 
required employees to use a passcode on their screen to validate or leverage hardware-based authentication.209  
Post-attack, organizations took additional steps to improve their security posture. For example, some organizations 
shortened their authentication and session lengths to force more frequent re-authentication for access to company 
platforms.210, 211 Other organizations also rotated keys to many internal services to effectively reset access,212 required

all access to company internal systems to originate from corporate-managed machines, and blocked third-party remote 
desktop support software.213 
Companies took targeted steps to improve MFA practices, including 
• 
implementing phishing-resistant hardware tokens for MFA;214 
• 
eliminating MFA push alerts;215 
• 
verifying employee identities through video verification to reduce social engineering when fulfilling MFA reset 
requests;216 and 
• 
transitioning to using Fast IDentity Online (FIDO)-supported applications and passwordless authentication.217, 
218 
Organizations also adjusted their audit procedures and established additional security requirements for their service 
providers to ensure they meet an acceptable level of security. These measures varied but included the adoption of zero 
trust architecture (ZTA),219 use of MFA for authentication, and safer access methods such as VDIs.220 
1.4.3. Detection 
Organizations found that early detection of attacks was important to enabling effective response. Companies took both 
mid- and post-attack actions to better detect and block suspicious events and attacks.  
After detecting an attack, an organization increased monitoring of its internal environment to identify any further 
suspicious activity.221 Discovering how a threat actor used compromised credentials to access its Slack environment, 
another organization implemented session fingerprinting to identify potentially re-used Slack sessions to detect 
attackers that were session hijacking.222 
Post attack, an organization increased the resiliency of its detection by creating endpoint detection and response agent 
redundancy after discovering that threat actors deleted its original detection and response platform from its cloud 
environment.223 One company improved its logs by making them more transparent to customers and enabling alerts 
every time support personnel accessed their information.224  
Regarding fraudulent SIM swaps, an organization also shared a historically practiced and successful method to detect 
suspicious anomalies where certain legitimate information relating to a customer is vastly different from that provided 
in connection with the requested SIM swap.225 
1.4.4. Personnel Security Awareness 
As part of preventative strategies to mitigate attacks, some organizations create awareness and education programs to 
enable employees to better recognize attacker TTPs and intrusion attempts. One organization developed an internal 
risk mitigation awareness campaign to engage and educate almost 100,000 employees and contractors in its 
workforce, creating increased incident reporting and a dramatic improvement of workers identifying simulated phishing

attempts after training.226 To simulate as authentic an attack as possible, one company trains its agents using actual 
vishing attempts (voice phishing) to familiarize employees.227 A company impacted by Lapsus$ also emphasized the 
importance of training employees of attack methods, which it credited with suspicious login reporting across its 
enterprise.228 
1.4.5. Threat Intelligence and Information Sharing 
Multiple organizations reported that sharing threat intelligence, including TTPs and indicators of compromise (IOCs), 
with peer companies and law enforcement contributed to a more effective response by helping to attribute threat 
activity and develop meaningful mitigations.229, 230, 231 Information was distributed through public avenues such as 
websites, blogs, and threat intelligence notices.232 In the aftermath of attacks, generally speaking, organizations are 
improving their threat intelligence sharing network to better prepare themselves and their customers against similar 
cyber threats. The following outlines some examples of where organizations successfully leveraged information sharing. 
It is not an exhaustive list but illustrates some positive outcomes. 
Industry Initiatives: 
• 
A victim organization initiated threat intelligence sharing arrangements with technology industry leaders, threat 
intelligence companies, and other corporate entities.233  
• 
An impacted company created an in-house threat intelligence team to share weekly intelligence with clients 
and peer organizations.234 
Customer-Facing Initiatives: 
• 
One organization shared customized threat briefings to educate customers on how to identify threat actor 
behavior in their environments.235 
• 
After an attack, an organization began reviewing its communication policies to adopt new systems that would 
help quickly and clearly notify customers when security or availability issues exist.236 
Law Enforcement Initiatives: 
• 
Leveraging an existing relationship with the cyber branch of the local FBI field office, one affected organization 
was able to contact an international law enforcement agency and share information that led to the arrest of 
one of the attackers.237 
1.5. 
DISRUPTION EFFORTS 
Successful coordination and collaboration with U.S., international law enforcement, and other government partners, 
was necessary to disrupt Lapsus$ and related threat actors. The sections below highlight how incident reporting plays 
into disrupting threat actors and summarize international law enforcement actions against Lapsus$.

1.5.1. Incident Reporting 
The Board heard that multiple targeted organizations reported attacks to FBI,238 and is aware of at least one prior 
victim company that confirmed FBI was able to share information with it about the threat actor, which was obtained 
from information shared with law enforcement.239 Another company reported to the Board that it shared information 
with the U.S. government beyond FBI and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) by reaching out to the 
General Services Administration (GSA), Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), the Defense 
Industrial Base Network (DIBNet), and briefing select members of Congress and the White House regarding its Lapsus$ 
attack.240 A victim company found the interaction with law enforcement to be collaborative and mutually beneficial.241 
Reporting Cyber Incidents to the U.S. Government 
In the U.S., law enforcement agencies and private sector organizations often cooperate to effectively counter threat 
actors. Federal law enforcement agencies have the authority to carry out sweeping countermeasures and otherwise 
act to disrupt a threat actor’s malicious activities. The agencies also have authority to enable widespread data 
sharing to improve resiliency and mitigation practices. Private industry has a dual mandate to defend its own 
organizations and ensure adequate information sharing with law enforcement and its peers within industry to enable 
the most comprehensive response to threat actors. 
FBI and CISA reported to the Board that their effectiveness and responsiveness in supporting organizations impacted 
by cyber intrusions can benefit from those organizations having prior relationships with FBI or CISA, the timely 
reporting of incidents to either FBI or CISA, and the organization’s willingness to voluntarily report and share further 
threat and incident information to help protect others from being targeted by similar malicious activities using the 
same infrastructure or TTPs.242 
FBI and CISA informed the Board that victim organizations sometimes choose to rely on third-party incident response 
firms without reporting the incident to FBI or CISA.243 An organization’s decision not to report limits the U.S. 
government’s ability to take disruptive action, such as the recovery of ransom payments or the decryption of data, 
either alone or in partnership with foreign and private sector partners.244 FBI and CISA stressed to the Board that 
victim organizations working with incident response firms and sharing information with the U.S. government will 
serve to maximize available remediation and disruption resources, improving outcomes for victim organizations and 
the cyber resilience of the U.S.245 
1.5.2. Investigations and Arrests 
Through the course of its review, the Board heard how U.S. agencies and global partners collaborated to disrupt 
Lapsus$. Notable examples include: 
• 
International law enforcement’s efforts to disrupt ongoing attacks by Lapsus$ and related members was 
evident when media sources publicly reported the arrests of several individuals in 2022. On March 24, 2022, 
the City of London Police released information about the arrest of seven individuals in connection with 
Lapsus$.246

REVIEW OF THE ATTACKS ASSOCIATED WITH LAPSUS$ AND RELATED THREAT GROUPS

• 
On April 1, 2022, the City of London Police announced that it had charged two juveniles with various cyber 
offenses related to an international police investigation into the Lapsus$ threat group.247, 248 
• 
On September 22, 2022, as part of an investigation by the U.K.’s National Crime Agency (NCA), the City of 
London Police arrested a seventeen-year-old from Oxfordshire on suspicion of hacking.249 While the related 
announcement did not disclose details about the nature of the investigation, media sources and one cyber 
threat intelligence firm believed the arrests were related to Lapsus$’s attacks against technology and gaming 
companies.250, 251 
• 
On October 19, 2022, as an offshoot of an operation codenamed “Operation Dark Cloud,” Brazilian police 
announced that they had arrested a Brazilian national suspected of belonging to Lapsus$.252 
Security researchers reported the group’s highly public communication style decreased after media sources reported 
that the City of London Police had arrested some of the group’s members in March 2022.253 However, researchers 
observed Lapsus$ attacking an organization in September 2022,254 and compromising and leaking content from a 
video game company in the same month.255, 256 Lapsus$ appears to have become inactive after September 2022.257 
Although this cannot be conclusively linked to law enforcement actions, the timing is noteworthy. Further, although the 
Board cannot rule out the possibility that the remaining Lapsus$ members have decided to limit their public profile, join 
other cybercrime groups, or rebrand, doing so often comes with an operational pause or other costs that are 
nonetheless positive developments from a cybersecurity perspective, even if only in the short term. 
1.5.3. Limiting Factors 
Law enforcement agencies face inhibiting factors when disrupting transnational networks of threat actors, as shown in 
the case of Lapsus$. The section below elaborates on three categories of issues that the Board heard. 
Information Sharing and International Collaboration 
International law enforcement and other government entities have made progress collaborating to advance cybercrime 
investigations. In recent years, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) conducted several successful multinational 
operations against cyber threat actors with partner countries.258 For example, law enforcement recently launched a 
coordinated international operation against the Genesis Market cybercrime marketplace that resulted in the arrest of 
many Genesis Market users around the world.259 In January 2023, the FBI announced it had covertly infiltrated the Hive 
ransomware network, preventing victims from having to pay, by conservative estimates, more than USD 130 million in 
ransom and providing over 1,000 decryption keys to victims. The FBI highlighted its coordination with international

partners including law enforcement and a tech-specific crime unit that led to the seizure of Hive servers and websites, 
dismantling its network.260 
Despite these successes, the Board heard that law enforcement-to-law enforcement information sharing can still be a 
challenge. Due to budgetary constraints, limited personnel are devoted to such cooperation in the cyber context, for 
example FBI has approximately 22 cyber-specific assistant legal attachés and DOJ has only one prosecutor focusing on 
coordinating international disruption operations, thereby limiting the number of planned coordinated operations that 
can be conducted at any given time.261 Legal frameworks and practices can also differ across countries, limiting the 
available consequences for cybercriminals or law enforcement’s ability to act against threat actors in certain countries 
(e.g., countries that traditionally serve as safe havens for cybercriminals, such as the Russian Federation [Russia], 
People’s Republic of China [PRC], Islamic Republic of Iran [Iran], and Democratic People’s Republic of Korea [DPRK, 
also known as North Korea]).262, 263 Additionally, countries may have different requirements for both informal and 
formal law enforcement information sharing, which in some cases must be conducted pursuant to the requirements of 
negotiated mutual legal assistance treaties that are often executed by a limited number of law enforcement personnel 
in each country.264 Finally, threat actor groups operated across many personas or group names and were also tracked 
under multiple identifiers265 across the cybersecurity industry, making it difficult to achieve consensus on the makeup 
of the groups and even their exploits in some cases.266 
Victim Engagement 
FBI faced challenges when engaging victim organizations following an incident due to the lack of pre-existing, trusted 
relationships with victims and their outside counsel; victims’ lack of familiarity with information-sharing mechanisms 
and protections; the lack of a continuous flow of information between victims and the FBI; multiple government entities 
requesting information from victims; and initial questions about attribution that may delay the assignment of agents 
with experience on the underlying threat groups.267, 268  
The Board heard from FBI that, following a high-profile incident, victims are often contacted by multiple government 
agencies with varying information needs, such as information regarding impact on victim company operations and 
threat actor TTPs and IOCs that are necessary to disrupt the threat actors' ongoing or future efforts. Such inquiries can 
take a victim’s incident response team away from critical recovery efforts and restoring business operations, delaying 
the reconstitution of services, and potentially causing further financial or reputational damage, or other consequences. 
FBI recognizes the need to balance the drive to pursue the threat actors and other governmental information 
requirements with the need to allow the victim’s incident response efforts to continue unimpeded.269 
Juvenile Offenders  
Many of Lapsus$ members’ high-profile arrests involved juvenile members (other threat groups likely have similar 
demographics). Some evidence from cybersecurity researchers suggests that existing perceptions, such as a lack of 
sufficient consequences for minors who engage in cybercrime, do not effectively deter some young people from 
repeatedly engaging in malicious behavior even when identified by law enforcement.270, 271 For example, on March 24, 
2022, media outlets reported that the City of London Police arrested seven juveniles in relation to the Lapsus$

group.272 However, shortly after the arrests, Lapsus$ announced it was “back from vacation” on March 29, posting a 
teaser screenshot of exfiltrated data and administrator credentials on its Telegram channel.273 Although juveniles are 
often swiftly released from custody, thus calling into question the level of disruption and impact from the juvenile 
justice system,274 FBI reported that it last observed Lapsus$ activity in September 2022 and assessed that the 
decrease in activity was likely due to the arrests of Lapsus$ members.275  
Threat groups’ recruitment of juveniles is a systemic issue.276 Forums and online games operate as pipelines for 
recruiting and developing juveniles. In one example, a security researcher observed a Lapsus$ member presenting 
early warning signs when the member posted on forums about network exploitation when as young as 11 or 12. The 
Board heard from a security researcher who believed that juvenile recruitment in cybercrime is a systemic issue with 
insufficient attention in the cyber ecosystem, as threats posed by juveniles are commonly underprioritized.277 Juvenile 
enforcement is further governed by certain procedures and laws that are not applicable to adult prosecutions.278 
Juvenile Pathways into Cybercrime 
Some studies have found that adolescents can start hacking between the ages of 10 and 15,279 primarily learning 
their skills through online forums and websites. This has a particular nexus with the development of cheats for 
popular video games.280 Forums, including those where game tips are shared and discussed, effectively serve as 
“talent development” pipelines for criminal elements that openly recruit juvenile and novice participants.281, 282 
Sandbox games, where players have a high degree of freedom to explore and interact, are acting as a gateway for 
minors to develop technical skills that can be leveraged for malicious intent.283 Sandbox games also offer an avenue 
for turning in-game currency into real money, and researchers have noted the intersection of a monetary incentive 
and a lack of adult supervision is a factor in adolescent participation in online criminal communities.284 Criminal 
gangs, in turn, exploit adolescents’ legal status in the criminal justice system, redirecting repercussions that could be 
imposed on adult threat actors operating in the background. Some members of Lapsus$ and its related groups seem 
to have followed this path.285

2. FINDINGS 
The Board’s findings and conclusions are the result of its independent review. They are based on information gleaned 
from literature searches, interviews, requests for information, and analysis of public, private, and government source 
information. The Board relied upon the voluntary participation of numerous organizations affected by this intrusion set.  
The findings and conclusions in this section are not intended to assign blame or fault to any individual or collective 
parties, but rather to highlight opportunities where the community can understand lessons and apply safety 
improvements for the future. 
2.1. 
SUMMARY OF FINDINGS  
Most organizations were not prepared to prevent the attacks described in this report, but most were able to rapidly 
change their security programs to account for vulnerabilities and make improvements to thwart future attacks. 
Companies that had prepared for the possibility of these kinds of attacks, against their own infrastructure as well as 
their suppliers, proved most resilient.  
The complex intersecting relationships between telecommunications providers and BPOs with their customers and 
clients were favored targets of the threat actors. The exploitation of insiders and insider processes in the supply chain 
of many organizations, especially, added an extra level of complexity for mitigating the attacks across the broader 
ecosystem. Unsurprisingly, successful social engineering techniques were also effective for atypical business 
processes, such as EDRs. 
The role of information sharing with law enforcement and the broader ecosystem played a vital role in the mitigation of 
attacks and disruption of threat actors. This is, however, an area with ongoing challenges. Organizations still experience 
friction in their ability or willingness to share information about attacks due to confusion about the government’s role, 
or perceived negative consequences of making attack details known, or a lack of familiarity with legal authorities 
designed to encourage such sharing. International and juvenile criminals also frustrate the under-resourced U.S. law 
enforcement apparatus.  
Finally, threat actors’ unauthorized access and theft of sensitive and proprietary data, in tandem with extortion, 
subjected targeted companies to repercussions, including reputational damage, service disruption, and regulatory 
implications. 
2.2. 
IDENTITY AND ACCESS MANAGEMENT (IAM) 
Identity and access management (IAM) weaknesses were a consistent theme in attacks across all targeted entities and 
present opportunities to make ongoing improvements.  
In the past decade, the emphasis on MFA has driven the adoption of more secure solutions to improve resiliency 
against attacks and phishing in particular.291 Enterprise and consumer adoption of MFA has been a beneficial step 
forward away from use of just passwords for authentication. However, the Board’s review found that the types of MFA 
used broadly in the online ecosystem today are not sufficient for most organizations or consumers defending against 
the type of attacks described in this report.292 In particular, OTP delivery and push notifications using SMS and voice 
calls (and even email) are vulnerable to social engineering and SIM swap attacks, and the attacker ecosystem is readily 
capable of exploiting these weaknesses. A lucrative SIM swap criminal market is enabling pay-for-access to victim 
 
291 The cybersecurity community has advocated for increased MFA adoption for over a decade, with modest success outcomes. For example, 
adoption of MFA for customers in the banking industry has increased substantially. Source: Sinigaglia, Federico et al.; Computers & Security

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cose.2020.101745 
292 This is a well-recognized finding by the broader cybersecurity community. For example, see: Kapko, Matt; Cybersecurity Dive, “Multifactor 
authentication is not all it’s cracked up to be,” October 5, 2022, https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/multifactor-authentication-

mobile phone services with a focus on hijacking SMS messages and voice calls.293, 294, 295 SMS was not designed to 
transact sensitive information such as OTPs, and its wide use as such incentivizes criminals to perform SIM swap 
attacks, porting fraud, and similar techniques. 
The use of MFA with number matching296 was an improvement for some organizations, and hardware-backed FIDO2 
MFA solutions proved most resilient. However, adopting advanced MFA capabilities remains a challenge for many 
organizations and individual consumers due to workflow and usability issues.297 The Board concurs that usable 
solutions will be necessary to evolve toward a more secure and passwordless user experience.298, 299 
Most of the attackers leveraged some form of social engineering at all stages of the attack chain, using a dynamic mix 
of phishing, vishing, and smishing to obtain passwords for initial entry, obtain sensitive information about the targeted 
organization, effect SIM swapping and call forwarding, negate ZTA (with device additions), and achieve other far-
reaching consequences. This tracks closely with industry observations on the human element being a factor in most 
breaches,300 and organizations will need to take additional measures to counter the effects of social engineering. 
Expensive endpoint security solutions were not an effective control to protect enterprise identities against social 
engineering. 
Attackers leveraging the “infostealer” malware ecosystem to buy target entity login credentials (“access as a service”) 
was a highly effective means of initial entry in many of the attacks perpetuated by these threat actors.301 The active 
development and deployment of malware toolkits (“malware as a service”) to steal web session cookies and other 
credentials from victim systems for later use has evolved into a lucrative and pernicious global pay-for-credentials 
underground market, whereby low-skill attacks can be initiated for a few thousand dollars and then deployed effectively 
against even well-defended organizations. Defense strategies against these types of attacks rely on endpoint security 
controls, and additional layers of defense are necessary to curb the increasing trend.

REVIEW OF THE ATTACKS ASSOCIATED WITH LAPSUS$ AND RELATED THREAT GROUPS

2.3. 
TELECOMMUNICATIONS VULNERABILITIES 
The Board heard from many experts that telecommunications providers are providing the government, enterprises, 
online commerce, and consumers with critical infrastructure. Threat actors clearly understand the role 
telecommunications providers play in the ecosystem and are targeting those providers to gain access to their 
customers. The defense of telecommunications infrastructure, service offerings, and operational processes that govern 
their business transactions is of vital importance for the nation’s security.302, 303  
The Board determined that customers are at risk when attackers can impersonate them and initiate changes to their 
mobile phone service, including for SIM swaps (when getting a new phone), number porting (when changing 
telecommunications providers), setting up call forwarding, and so on. The Board heard that improving these processes 
is challenging, as telecommunications providers need to maintain low-friction customer experiences for a wide range of 
user needs and account for unique and emergent situations, including domestic abuse, loss of identification cards, and 
global travel.304 Furthermore, the carriers currently have limited options for identity verification and other solutions may 
not be scalable. 
The Board learned through attackers’ public comments and interviews with targeted entities that attackers can socially 
engineer, coerce, or bribe telecommunications staff, including those in customer support centers, retail stores, and 
elsewhere. In comparable industries, such as banking, where employees need to access sensitive personal data to 
service customers, additional advanced insider threat controls and strong identity verification can be helpful in 
preventing threat actors from tricking, coercing, or bribing staff to act on their behalf.305  
The security of telecommunications infrastructure that provides service to customers is vital to the security of these 
transactions. In several instances, the threat actors leveraged known vulnerabilities to hijack telecommunications tools, 
placing backdoors for initial entry or otherwise modifying their behavior. This underscores the importance of using 
robust software development lifecycle and secure-by-default coding and system management practices to design, 
implement, and maintain internal systems over their lifetime. 
Telecommunications provider retail stores were also an effective avenue of attack, with attackers planting malware on 
point-of-sale systems and stealing retailer devices with privileged access to make fraudulent changes to customer 
mobile phone service. Attackers also co-opted employees as insiders in retail stores,306 a trend that is challenging to 
counter as these jobs are typically lower pay with low-vetted personnel, including juveniles, who can move untracked 
between companies. 
2.4. 
RESILIENCY WITH A FOCUS ON BUSINESS PROCESS OUTSOURCING (BPO) 
The Board found that the threat actors had a remarkable understanding of their targets’ core business, associated 
business processes, and their weaknesses. In some instances, they successfully leveraged low-complexity attack 
methods that circumvented security preventative and detective controls. Even well-defended companies fell prey, but 
those with layered, mature defense-in-depth controls were most resilient, including use of ZTA, strong authentication, 
robust detection, adaptable MFA capabilities, vulnerability management programs, response plans, and awareness 
 
302 The importance of telecommunications industry defense is globally recognized. In the past decade, coordinated attacks and criminal 
rings aimed at telecommunications providers gave rise to new efforts to bolster and mandate security improvements. For example, see: 
Industrial Cyber, “Cybersecurity issues in telecoms sector call for protection of network infrastructure and availability,” January 29, 2023, 
https://industrialcyber.co/features/cybersecurity-issues-in-telecoms-sector-call-for-protection-of-network-infrastructure-and-availability  
303 The U.S. government is asserting more stringent guidance and requirements for the security of telecommunications infrastructure and 
services. For example, see: CISA, “NSTAC Report to the President: Strategy for Increasing Trust in the Information and Communications 
Technology and Services Ecosystem,” February 21, 2023, https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-

training. These organizations either fully repelled or quickly recovered from attacks, with little long-term impact on their 
business.  
Other organizations that had not matured their security controls had more challenges recovering, and, in some cases, 
were hindered by misaligned cybersecurity budgets.307 For example, BYOD policies are cost efficient as they enable 
employees to use their own computers. However, BYOD enabled the threat actors studied for this report to pivot into 
corporate environments after compromising employees’ personal devices and accounts. The trend of using more cost-
effective workforce options, such as BPOs, for sensitive business workflows was another example of how cost-saving 
mechanisms may not be in line with an organization’s threat model.  
Employee awareness and insider risk management factored heavily into whether organizations defended well against 
this class of threat actors. The threat actors impersonated a wide range of legitimate company personnel via phishing, 
smishing, and vishing to trick employees into acting on their behalf, for example by accessing customer records. These 
social engineering tactics may require prevention, detection, and response capabilities that mirror insider threat 
programs so that privileged access cannot be abused by a threat actor leveraging an employee’s account.308 Designing 
employee awareness programs that cover this specific class of threat actors was also helpful in some organizations for 
early detection and resiliency against attacks.  
Enterprise-wide security hygiene was a major factor in whether organizations successfully repelled attacks. The Board 
heard of several intrusions that involved exploiting, for example, weak MFA implementations or misconfigured or 
unpatched AD infrastructure, which gave the threat actors their opportunity. Standard network and system-level 
visibility (telemetry) and programmable detection were also critical for organizations looking for past and ongoing attack 
activity. The Board concurs with the views of several briefers in determining that adopting perceived advanced, novel, 
or sophisticated (and often expensive) security solutions cannot replace the need for basic security hygiene and 
capabilities.309 
Having established and practiced response plans was the final important element of resiliency. For example, in 
instances where the threat actors took over internal communications used by the response teams, organizations that 
had previously setup out-of-band communications were able to avoid having their activities monitored or interrupted. 
Previously established industry and law enforcement relationships also enabled organizations to quickly attribute the 
attacks and share best practices for mitigating the threat actors. However, the Board also heard that some 
organizations may be hesitant to share information regarding security attacks due to concerns over loss of attorney-
client privilege, regulatory and legal implications, and reputational damage. These challenges are ongoing hinderances 
to frictionless collaboration. 
2.4.1. Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) Risks 
These attacks demonstrated how threat actors can exploit BPOs so the threat actors can then attack their clients, and 
how other serious threat actor groups, including nation-states, are using this class of attacks as a model. The U.S. 
government, the cybersecurity community, and BPO client organizations need to understand the specific risk exposures 
in the outsourcing sector, given the role BPOs are playing for organizations, including those supporting critical 
infrastructure.  
The BPO operating structure related to their clients’ trusted access and sensitive data enables threat actors to access 
targeted entities by bypassing the target’s defenses and going through the sometimes lesser defenses of the BPO. 
Some organizations the Board spoke with had not previously considered their BPOs in their attack surface and risk 
management programs, even though they hold sensitive levels of access to clients’ systems and data. Many BPO 
employees and workflows were onboarded and risk-managed differently from the client organization, leading to 
potential risk exposures and governance challenges for both the BPO and its clients. Industry-gathered data mirror 
these findings closely and suggest that many organizations lack confidence that a breach at their third-party supplier

would be reported to them and that breaches may be under-reported.310 The Board noted the broader industry 
conversation on these issues, including the increasing use of the legal system for recourse.311 
In the aftermath of the attacks, many targeted organizations pivoted slowly to improve the security posture at the BPO 
to be commensurate with their own if they could not insource workflows.312, 313 Other organizations terminated their 
partnerships with BPOs (bringing workflows in-house). Client organizations that remained with their BPOs found it 
challenging to verify the BPO was upholding sufficient security standards and found few mechanisms for accountability. 
Most legal contractual agreements did not clearly outline the roles and responsibilities between BPOs and their clients 
to support either preventative controls improvement or incident response activities. 
2.5. 
LAW ENFORCEMENT AND JUVENILE DISRUPTION 
The Board found that while arrests have chilling effects on the cybercriminal community, law enforcement is challenged 
by a lack of sufficient resources devoted to disrupting cybercrime; a hesitancy from victims and their legal advisors to 
report cybercrimes and share actionable information; vulnerabilities in the processes some providers have for requests 
to obtain consumer data from organizations during emergency situations; and countries that act as safe havens for 
cybercriminal activity. Additionally, the deterrence value of available criminal justice consequences remains limited for 
juvenile cybercrime offenders, and few (and no U.S.-based) cyber-specific intervention programs exist that can help 
divert potential offenders to legitimate cybersecurity-related activities. 
The Board found that the EDR process creates a significant exposure point for communications services providers 
because the process is not standardized across the industry and often lacks a method for authentication and 
validation. As a result, threat actors could exploit providers’ employees by spoofing EDR materials using compromised 
government email addresses and official logos. Further, the Board found that EDR process exploitation was not limited 
to Lapsus$, but points to a broader, systematic risk exposure issue, which threat actors can exploit to gain valuable 
intelligence about their targets. 
2.5.1. Victim Assistance Operations 
The Board heard that law enforcement is hampered in its efforts to effectively combat cyber threats if victim 
organizations do not report attacks with actionable information. However, targeted organizations and their legal 
counsel are often unfamiliar with the information-sharing mechanisms and protections for reporting incidents to 
government contacts, which hinders the much-needed flow of information between victims and FBI or other law 
enforcement and diminishes the support the government can provide to a victim, similarly situated victims, and would-
be victims. These findings indicate that prompt notifications to law enforcement about cyberattacks and above-board 
information sharing from organizations increase the likelihood of preserving critical evidence and recovering ransom 
payments or decrypting data, streamline government assistance, prevent uncoordinated government inquiries, and 
allow for more frequent and impactful cybercrime disruptions, all of which are a net cybersecurity benefit for society. 
That said, some organizations the Board spoke to were confused about the federal roles and responsibilities for 
cyberattacks and which agency they should call to receive assistance and aid in future disruptions. The Board 
recognizes that the federal government has improved its governance and incident response coordination with national 
policies such as the Presidential Policy Directive 41314 and its evolving implementation. However, clear messaging to 
the public and private sector about roles and responsibilities is lacking—in particular, where entities and individuals can 
go to receive specific services or meet statutory and regulatory reporting requirements. Therefore, the Board endorses

experienced a breach that originated from one of their third-party suppliers within the last 12 months, with the rates increasing over time.

the federal government’s plans, as stated in Strategic Objective 1.4 of the National Cybersecurity Strategy (Update 
Federal Incident Response Plans and Processes), to “strengthen processes, procedures, and systems to more fully 
realize the policy that ‘a call to one is a call to all.’”315 
2.5.2. Cybercrime Investigations 
The Board learned that disrupting transnational networks of threat actors presents myriad challenges. Law 
enforcement remains underfunded for resource- and data-intensive investigations against the full breadth of threat 
actors; has complex coordination processes with international partners, including obtaining evidence from multiple 
international jurisdictions; faces some victims’ reluctance to report incidents and share actionable information; and is 
restricted by sovereignties that disregard peacetime norms of responsible state behavior in cyberspace or otherwise act 
as safe havens for cybercriminals. But a properly resourced and dedicated investigative team can still find methods to 
impose consequences on these difficult-to-reach actors, as recently demonstrated by FBI’s Hive decryptor operation, 
Snake malware takedown, and the arrest of several enablers of the ransomware ecosystem. 
In addition, the cybersecurity industry tracks threat actors, which operate under many personas and group names, with 
multiple identifiers, such as TTPs, target geography, target sector, and motivation. This can delay attributing behaviors 
and attacks to the correct threat actors and may prolong assigning agents with experience to the appropriate case 
concerning specific threat groups.316 The National Cybersecurity Strategy317 recognizes many of these challenges, 
indicating that the successful coordination and collaboration of U.S. and international law enforcement and government 
partners, as well as a more agile and well-resourced law enforcement, can counter the threat posed by cybercriminals 
and mitigate existing response challenges. 
2.5.3. Early Intervention 
Law enforcement entities face an increasing cadre of technically savvy cybercriminals, some of whom begin their 
malicious activities as juveniles. However, the juvenile status of certain threat actors can limit federal law 
enforcement’s role and yield lighter penalties under their home countries’ legal frameworks. Depending on the 
applicable laws, the post-conviction punishment for a juvenile is typically not as severe as it would be for an adult.318 
Nevertheless, juvenile justice issues are not limited to the cyber context and reflect the relevant society’s broader 
conclusions about the criminal culpability and just punishment of minors. As a result, the Board found that less severe 
consequences may not adequately deter young cybercriminals from re-offending.  
To curb juvenile participation in cybercrime, the Board found that several law enforcement entities are implementing 
preventative tactics and program initiatives319 that demonstrate cost-effective means to identify and redirect at-risk 
juveniles that can also improve the pool of employable personnel to fill cybersecurity jobs.320 This finding indicates that 
encouraging positive and legal alternatives, for example events at gaming conferences, to channel the energy and 
technical savviness of youth may potentially support hobbies and careers that benefit juveniles’ technical skills 
advancement.  
Other last-resort interventions, including non-prosecutorial and deferred prosecutorial disruption,321 have proven useful 
for alerting unaware parents to juvenile cybercrime activity and dissuading future activity.

2.6. 
IMPACT ON BUSINESS OPERATIONS 
In aggregate, many organizations experienced costly and destructive impacts from these attacks. However, the Board 
learned that while some incidents directly affected targeted organizations’ revenue streams, the impact of cyberattacks 
on business extends far beyond immediate financial loss.  
Organizations lost control of “crown jewel” intellectual property and consumer data, subjecting them to remediation 
expenses, consumer notification and monitoring expenses, reputational harm, and litigation risk. As a result, the Board 
learned that differing costs exist between destructive attacks and data theft. For example, in a ransomware negotiation 
scenario, threat actors can financially impact an organization by destroying its IT infrastructure. However, regulatory 
implications can culminate in even greater costs to impacted organizations, ultimately giving threat actors more control 
over their targets.322  
Organizations also expended time, productivity, and money on incident response, remediation efforts, reputation 
management, and system reconfigurations, as well as other follow-on effects such as termination of contracts (among 
BPOs and client companies) and insurance adjustments. The Board determined the rise in cyberattacks necessitate 
investments in security measures and business processes; however, the ongoing cost of maintaining and updating 
these controls can pose a significant burden to organizations, possibly impacting customer friction, innovation, and 
profitability.  
The Board found that innocuous personal information such as job titles, employer information, and work locations, 
which employees often post on social media, can provide threat actors with enough information to cross-reference 
public information sources and discover important personal data about critical employees. While reinforcing 
operational security measures may diminish threat actors’ resources for leveraging dangerous harassment techniques, 
like doxing and swatting, the Board concluded that many of these measures are time-consuming and severely interrupt 
an employee’s private life.

3. RECOMMENDATIONS 
The Cyber Safety Review Board’s (CSRB, or the Board) recommendations are organized under four themes: 
strengthening identity and access management (IAM); mitigating telecommunications and reseller vulnerabilities; 
building resiliency across multi-party systems with a focus on business process outsourcers (BPOs); and addressing law 
enforcement challenges and juvenile cybercrime. 
The recommendations outlined in this section reflect the Board’s tasking to identify improvements for cybersecurity and 
make independent, strategic, and actionable recommendations to the President. The Board calls on organizations to 
implement improvements to build resiliency against the threats posed by groups like Lapsus$, particularly through 
stronger access controls and authentication methods, and mature risk management for their entire enterprises, 
including third party vendors. The Board calls on telecommunications providers to employ stronger security protocols to 
prevent SIM swapping, and on federal regulators such as the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and Federal 
Trade Commission (FTC) to ensure those improvements are made through appropriate regulatory oversight and 
supervision. The Board also calls on lawmakers to create and support community programs that disincentivize juveniles 
from engaging in, while helping law enforcement deter, cybercrime and ensuring government agencies receive 
adequate funding and resources. 
3.1. 
IDENTITY AND ACCESS MANAGEMENT (IAM) 
IAM weaknesses described in this report are some of the most serious vulnerabilities in the digital ecosystem. Dramatic 
improvements are necessary and will require a “whole of industry” approach to innovate and implement meaningful 
solutions. 
National Cybersecurity Strategy 
As laid out in the National Cybersecurity Strategy, the burden of change should fall on the organizations most 
capable and best positioned to make the digital ecosystem secure and resilient.323 In line with federal agencies’ 
adoption of modern multi-factor authentication (MFA),324 enterprises should implement appropriate controls and 
alternative authentication factors to better protect their environments, partners, suppliers, and employees. To 
support these efforts, the federal government should provide funding, incentives, and guidance for organizations to 
mature their authentication methods and work toward a passwordless world. 
3.1.1. Everyone Must Progress Toward a Passwordless World  
The attacks described in this report illustrate how easy attackers find obtaining authentication strings, including 
plaintext passwords, application programming interface (API) keys, session tokens, one-time passcodes, and other 
credentials via phishing and malware, as well as gaining access to password databases and credentials stored in 
source code. The digital ecosystem needs to prioritize moving beyond use of text-based strings for authentication. 
Technology Providers Should Design and Deliver Secure IAM Solutions by Default 
The Board recommends that technology providers innovate and deliver easy-to-use, secure-by-default IAM solutions 
that eliminate the need for text-based strings for authentication.  
• 
Web and mobile application developers should leverage Fast IDentity Online (FIDO)2-compliant, hardware-
backed solutions built into consumer devices by default.325, 326 Use of these built-in tokens should have easy

integration with applications and web-based services, leveraging standards such as WebAuthn327 and 
technologies such as Passkeys.328 
• 
Technology providers should immediately begin to transition away from Short Message Service (SMS) and 
voice MFA. Transitioning from SMS and voice MFA to stronger MFA methods is consistent with National 
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 800-63B (Rev. 3) and other globally accepted guidance.329, 330, 331 
See Appendix B for further details on the strengths and weaknesses of different authentication methods. 
• 
Operating system developers, web browser designers, and hardware manufacturers should address the 
widespread theft and monetization of authentication cookies, such as via infostealer malware, by 
implementing secure-by-default safety mechanisms that protect these credentials. For example, online service 
providers could automatically and silently reissue cookies, possibly every hour, to reduce the window of 
opportunity for attackers to reuse them. 
o 
Hardware-backed schemes could help raise the bar for 
defending against cookie theft. For example, proposals like 
Device Bound Session Credentials (DBSC) and Browser 
Proof-of-Possession (BPoP) aim to mitigate cookie and 
token theft techniques by providing application-level 
binding and browser-initiated refreshes.333, 334 
The U.S. Government Should Provide Standards, Guidance, and Tools to 
Support Organizations’ Authentication Journeys 
The United States (U.S.) government is responsible for shaping the digital ecosystem in a direction that puts the user 
first and harmonizes security and accessibility. The National Cybersecurity Strategy commits the U.S. government to 
take urgent steps in defending today’s digital ecosystem while simultaneously building a more sustainable and resilient 
future.335 Modernizing and securing authentication is at the forefront of this approach. The Office of Management and 
Budget’s (OMB) Zero Trust Strategy and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency’s (CISA) More Than a 
Password campaign emphasize the importance of MFA.336, 337 The Board recommends that the U.S. government 
support organizations’ authentication maturity roadmaps by providing guidance that addresses their respective realities 
and dependencies. 
The U.S. government, specifically OMB, NIST, and CISA, in consultation with the Office of the National Cyber Director 
and other Departments and Agencies, as appropriate, should collaborate with industry stakeholders to develop and 
promote a secure authentication roadmap that can help organizations make the transition to a world without 
passwords. This roadmap should include standards and frameworks, guidance, tools, and technology specific to 
organizations’ needs and circumstances that account for size, industry, threat profile, as well as privacy and civil 
liberties considerations. This guidance should also enable organizations to assess their authentication maturity and

progress toward leading practices, including password policies and strategies, zero trust architecture (ZTA) 
implementation, and authentication lifecycle management. 
3.1.2. Organizations Should Prioritize Efforts to Reduce the Efficacy of Social Engineering 
As organizations integrate more robust authentication capabilities within their environments, they have an opportunity 
to reduce the efficacy of social engineering attacks. This will require prioritizing culture alongside more effective 
technology capabilities. 
• 
Organizations should begin to require an explicit authentication event using a form of phishing-resistant MFA, 
such as FIDO2-backed tokens, for each sensitive transaction executed on their systems. The definition of a 
sensitive transaction will be dependent on the nature of the organization’s business but may include accessing 
a sensitive customer record; using privileged access in the infrastructure, for example to raise privileges to 
Administrator; or performing a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) swap. 
• 
Organizations should educate employees on a frequent and regular basis, possibly monthly, and in a relatable 
and easily digestible manner, on the latest threat landscape trends and how to prevent them. Organizations 
should foster a security culture where employees are incentivized to report potential intrusions while training 
employees on how to identify and respond to creative social engineering attacks.338 
The U.S. government should spearhead the development and promotion of resources that help organizations develop a 
robust security culture, including monthly training material and example protocols that help deter common social 
engineering techniques. In doing this, the government should continue fostering cross-sector collaboration and 
information sharing between organizations, government agencies, and cybersecurity experts. 
3.2. 
TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND RESELLER VULNERABILITES 
As observed in this review, threat actors targeted telecommunications providers and the critical infrastructure in which 
they operate. Customers and retailers are at risk for social engineering and other manipulation schemes, which allow 
threat actors to access sensitive information and backdoors to additional targets. The telecommunications industry, as 
well as federal regulators, should take steps to build resiliency against fraudulent activities and help defend individual 
customers, retail employees, and the industry as a whole from threat actors. 
3.2.1. Build Resiliency Against Fraudulent Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) Swapping 
Telecommunications providers and resellers should implement countermeasures for SIM swap attacks. While some of 
these measures will add friction into the customer experience, the Board believes countermeasures are necessary to 
further prevent fraudulent SIM swaps, and follow-on crimes, from occurring. To comprehensively address the most 
common mechanisms behind fraudulent SIM swaps, telecommunications providers should take the following actions. 
Build Resiliency Against Social Engineering in SIM swapping Procedures to Protect the Consumer 
• 
Provide the ability for customers to lock their accounts to prevent SIM swaps. This should lock SIM swap 
capabilities at all levels of the telecommunications provider’s systems, including backend and customer 
support access, operated either by the telecommunications provider directly or their BPOs, vendors, and 
partners. Customers should also be provided with a strong multi-layered identity validation process to unlock 
their account for a valid SIM swap. 
• 
Make strong identity verification for SIM swaps the default on all customer accounts such that customers 
would have to “opt out” of having enhanced authentication security protections. 
• 
Treat SIM swaps as a highly privileged action with tight controls on who can perform them. Best practice 
controls should be put in place, such as those used in the banking industry.339 This may include:

o 
enforcing a waiting period of up to 24 hours, based on risk modeling, if a customer does not have 
sufficient identity credentials available. This would allow the provider to notify an account holder of an 
attempt to activate a new SIM card on their account, as well as provide the customer a window of 
opportunity to confirm or reject the request; 
o 
applying additional measures, such as taking a photo of the SIM swap requester, if strong authentication 
credentials are unavailable. This measure would create a deterrence for malicious actors while balancing 
the needs of vulnerable populations such as victims of domestic violence, homeless people, single 
parents, etc., who might not have strong credentials; 
o 
requiring strong identity validation before performing a SIM swap while also maintaining robust exceptions 
procedures if a customer cannot provide this identification. Strong identity validation could include 
providing two forms of government-issued credentials in person, or through a third-party identity provider 
like login.gov; 
o 
requiring a requestor to use video chat or a comparable tool to visually provide strong credentials when 
completing a transaction online or over the phone. If video chat is unavailable, a waiting period of at least 
24 hours would ensue with the same purpose; 
o 
providing account holders with a detailed record when a SIM swap occurs, including who initiated the 
request, when it was initiated, how the action was performed, and other relevant information; 
o 
providing increased, mandatory, frequent, and recurring cybersecurity training focusing on fraudulent SIM 
swaps and insider threats to retail employees and others involved in adding, modifying, and deleting 
phone service; 
o 
limiting the number of persons allowed to perform SIM swaps to those trained, reviewed, and trusted, and 
regularly reviewing access permissions; 
o 
improving personnel security checks and employee tracking across telecommunications providers and 
retail stores to the extent possible in compliance with applicable employment laws;340 
o 
limiting collection and sharing of personally identifiable information (PII) with employees to what is 
necessary for the specific transaction and regularly removing unnecessary data from their systems; 
o 
requiring an employee (also partner, vendor, BPO, etc.) issuing the SIM swap request to successfully 
complete an authentication challenge when the request is submitted to the system, using a strong MFA 
solution such as a hardware-backed FIDO key or a biometric authentication; 
o 
tracking the number of fraudulent SIM swaps monthly by dealer/reseller and imposing business costs, 
such as ceasing to continue business, with those that do not take action to mitigate or stop fraudulent 
swaps; and 
o 
handling fraudulent SIM swaps as a crime, including referral of cases to law enforcement. 
 
340 CSRB recognizes that employees suspected of wittingly engaging in fraudulent SIM swaps or repeatedly completing them may not always 
be subject to criminal or legal action apart from having their employment terminated. While recognizing that employment laws in some 
states may prohibit a former employer from sharing disciplinary information or reasons for termination, CSRB encourages the 
telecommunications industry to consider reviewing and where possible, adopting insider threat models and other practices employed by 
industries such as the financial sector and airports.

Additional Methods to Exploit SMS/voice MFA 
While not attributed to the threat actors in this review, the Board heard of additional methods threat actors use to 
exploit SMS/voice MFA that informed its recommendations to telecommunications providers and resellers. Methods 
to initiate a fraudulent SIM swap with internal resources include generating telecommunications provider codes;341 
stealing customer account management devices in “smash-and-grabs” at wireless retail stores; deploying malware 
on point-of-sale workstations at telecommunications provider stores; and using an automated Telegram bot to abuse 
wireless carriers’ APIs to PII, Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI), and corporate data.342 
Similar to SIM swapping is a technique called port-out fraud, where a threat actor impersonates the target to that 
individual's phone provider to transfer the target’s phone number to an account set up by the threat actor. This tactic 
directs phone calls and texts that were intended for the target to the threat actor’s phone, allowing the intercept of 
SMS and voice MFA.343, 344 
Prevent Exploitation of Vulnerabilities on Point-of-Sale Systems through Improved Asset Management 
• 
Detect and mitigate theft and abuse of point-of-sale devices and tablets at retail stores that are used to 
process customer transactions. If the devices are stolen or abused in-store, they should be rendered unable to 
perform any privileged actions, including SIM swaps, by wiping them remotely within a standardized timeframe 
or revoking trusted access until they can be properly assessed. 
• 
Use ZTA concepts in retail stores to prevent untrusted or new devices from joining the network, including 
virtual systems. This should include regular vulnerability scanning and subsequently de-trusting devices that do 
not have up-to-date patching or configurations. 
Apply Measures to Harden the Technology Stack 
• 
Assess and harden all applications and APIs used to manage customer accounts, including those enabling SIM 
swaps. These applications and APIs should be considered sensitive and use industry best practices, including 
secure coding principles;345 server and application hardening, for example transmission confidentiality and 
integrity and information flow enforcement;346 and routine third-party audits and penetration tests. 
3.2.2. Strengthen Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) 
Oversight and Enforcement Activities 
Organizations’ and consumers’ reliance on mobile phones and cellular service make them essential components of the 
nation’s telecommunications practices. Fraudulent SIM swaps undermine the security and reliability of the 
telecommunications ecosystem. While fraudulent SIM swaps happen relatively infrequently, the consequences can be 
extraordinarily damaging and disruptive. Victims are often impacted both financially and physically, as the threat actors 
are often involved in “traditional” crimes such as theft, kidnapping, extortion, murder, and sexual abuse.347  
Telecommunications industry regulators need to standardize and facilitate the adoption of best practices to reduce or 
eliminate fraudulent SIM swaps. FCC and FTC should strengthen oversight and enforcement activities focused on 
fraudulent SIM swapping transactions with the following actions.

• 
Require regular reporting, for example monthly or annually, on the number of fraudulent SIM swaps impacting 
a service provider’s customers. Reporting should include attacks for all customers using the cellular network of 
the provider, including attacks involving 
customers of downstream Mobile Virtual 
Network Operators. 
• 
Document and enforce best practices (see 
Recommendation 3.2.1) for telecommunications 
industry business processes, including for their 
BPOs, retailers, dealers, resellers, and others, 
for verifying the identity of a customer and 
performing a SIM swap on their behalf. The 
banking industry has similar controls and 
regulatory oversight.349 
• 
Incentivize better security at 
telecommunications providers by enacting 
penalties for fraudulent SIM swaps or lax 
controls. 
3.3. 
RESILIENCY WITH A FOCUS ON BUSINESS PROCESS OUTSOURCERS (BPOs) 
Organizations, including associated BPOs and service providers, with robust cybersecurity programs that follows 
industry-standard practices are better positioned to defend against attacks by external threat actors. Designing, 
building, and maintaining a strong security framework does not create perfect defense, but it forms the essential 
foundation for ongoing risk management of complex and dynamic business needs, technology, and attacker tradecraft. 
3.3.1. Plan for Disruptive Cyber Intrusions and Invest in Prevention, Response, and Recovery Capabilities 
Organizations should create roadmaps to rapidly adopt emerging modern architectures that can best defend against 
disruptive cyber-intrusions caused by groups such as Lapsus$ and related threat actors. 
• 
Organizations should carefully tune their cybersecurity program to adopt best practices in the NIST 
Cybersecurity Framework (CSF),350 with a particular emphasis on: 
o 
robust information technology (IT) asset management practices to identify an organization’s critical 
infrastructure (CI), provide adequate visibility of networks, and map attack surfaces to the greatest extent 
possible; 
o 
effective implementation of least privilege access methodology and auditing, especially for assets, 
accounts, and actions that are highly sensitive; and 
o 
insightful and actionable monitoring capabilities enabled through sound, centralized log management 
policies. The ability to detect heuristic anomalies in these log files can alert security of an impending 
incident and capture log file data during an incident already underway and can aid investigation, 
disruption, and prevention of future attacks.

Portability (LNP) rules to require wireless providers to 
adopt secure methods of authenticating a customer 
before redirecting a customer’s phone number to a new 
device or provider.348 While the rules are still pending 
final vote at the time of publication, continued focus on 
and specific measures to prevent fraudulent SIM swaps 
will help build resiliency across the cyber ecosystem.

Develop and Test a Cyber Incident Response Plan Specific to Extortion, Ransomware, and Harassment-Related Events 
Organizations with previously developed cyber incident response plans generally recovered faster from attacks by the 
class of threat actor discussed in this report. The Board recommends all organizations take similar measures, in 
particular referencing the NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-61: Computer Security Incident Handling Guide, but also 
specifically consider the following actions to address the unique nature of the attacks outlined in this report.  
During an incident, organizations should follow their established response plan, notify law enforcement as soon as 
possible, and monitor communications closely for unauthorized participants to reduce impact and prevent future 
intrusions.354, 355  
• 
Outline the organization’s desired response plan procedures to handle and mitigate unique elements of 
ransomware, extortion, and harassment-related events.356, 357, 358 
o 
Determine which mission-critical data, networks, assets, or services, i.e., the organization’s critical 
infrastructure, should receive prioritized attention and restoration during and after a cyber incident. 
o 
Lessen the impact of extortion demands and ransoms by documenting when and how to restore backup 
data or replace systems to ensure the integrity of backups. These procedures should be regularly tested 
and validated to ensure that they can be successfully performed within the organization’s required 
timeframe, for example within six hours. 
o 
Establish relationships and information sharing agreements with government and industry partners, 
building upon existing communities like Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs), Information 
Sharing and Analysis Organizations (ISAOs), and trade associations, to create a “community of trust” that 
supports actionable cooperation before, during, and after an incident. 
o 
Be prepared to work closely with law enforcement (see Recommendation 3.4.2) and to make any 
mandatory reporting to regulators.

incident response team with mitigation and future resilience. On a limited basis and pending the timeliness and extent of an entity’s 
engagement, FBI may be able to take further action such as freezing stolen funds or providing decryption keys. When victims engage with 
their local FBI field office as part of the cyber incident response plan, they will contribute to the FBI’s mission and overall security of the 
global cyber ecosystem. Source: FBI and CISA Panel Interview, CSRB Meeting.

Regularly test, update, and exercise its incident response plan (ideally, quarterly). 
• 
Encourage BPOs and their clients to agree upon contractual terms and co-develop response plans, regularly 
test them, and cooperate fully during incidents as an extension of the client organization (see 
Recommendation 3.3.2). 
• 
Build pre-incident trust relationships and establish information sharing agreements with other private sector 
organizations; law enforcement, such as Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI); federal responders, such as 
CISA; and relevant sector risk management agencies (SRMAs), as needed, to expedite coordination during an 
incident. 
• 
Establish clearly defined roles, responsibilities, and contact information for personnel leading critical response 
functions during a cyber incident, including, but not limited to, decision makers for notification to response 
organizations like FBI and CISA; oversight of the cyber incident response effort, including technical mitigation 
and operational decisions; courses of action to mitigate attacker activity; compliance regarding cyber incident 
law, policy, and regulations; and public communications (see Recommendation 3.3.2). 
• 
Source and validate contact information for external industry and government partners, including, but not 
limited to, incident response firms and/or security operations centers (SOCs); knowledgeable legal counsel; 
local FBI361 and CISA offices; and affected third-party clients or vendors, for example BPOs, cloud service 
providers, and commercial data centers. 
Conduct After-Action Reviews Following an Incident 
Affected organizations also reported on the benefits of conducting a robust after-action review to learn from an incident 
and identify areas for improvement. Such after-actions should, at minimum:362  
• 
consider the need to improve the organization’s incident response plan, including its assigned roles and 
responsibilities; communication and training plans; and technical mitigation processes and priorities; 
• 
address legal, policy, and regulatory considerations before a future incident occurs; such hurdles might 
include, but are not limited to, liability and privilege concerns the general counsel may have experienced when 
sharing incident information with government entities;363 and

361 FBI told the Board its goal is to build trust with the organizations it serves across both the private and public sectors. It can most 
effectively accomplish this by developing relationships with organizations before a cyber intrusion occurs. When FBI has an established 
relationship with an organization, it can share unique intelligence and be transparent about what FBI can and cannot do. Source: FBI and 
CISA Panel Interview, CSRB Meeting.  
362 Since the Lapsus$ attack, one company implemented monthly conversations for BPOs to discuss threat intelligence, which they had not 
been doing previously. Another company enhanced its telemetry to enable visibility of device content and trust levels across the organization, 
an ability it did not have prior to January 2022. Source: Targeted Organization, CSRB Meeting.; Targeted Organization, CSRB Meeting.  
363 Some respondents shared that the U.S. government should consider expanding liability and privilege protection for the victimized 
organization, which can otherwise serve as a barrier to post-intrusion reporting. We should seek to expand liability and privilege protections 
so victims can engage efficiently and without risk, with non-regulatory federal government agencies. In recent years, Congress and the U.S. 
government have taken important steps to reduce barriers to cybersecurity-related information sharing by the private sector, including the 
Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 (CISA 2015) and the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022 (CIRCIA).

• 
determine whether to report additional details about the incident to the government or a trust community to 
spread awareness about the threat, reduce the likelihood of a similar event happening to others, and further 
the relationships by which advance warning of future threats may be shared. 
3.3.2. Business Process Outsourcers (BPOs) and Client Companies Should Mature and Strengthen their 
Risk Management Practices Reflecting their Shared Risk, and the United States (U.S.) Government 
Should Support These Efforts 
Client Organizations and BPOs Should Agree Upon a Shared Responsibility Model for Cybersecurity Risk, Enshrined in 
Contracts 
Organizations should incorporate cybersecurity requirements in contract language to ensure that BPO operations meet 
the same level of security as internal company practices. This should include clear definitions of the service level 
agreements (SLAs) that enable monitoring and risk management.  
In some circumstances, such as BPOs handling highly sensitive transactions, consider securing BPO staff operations 
similar to the standards for client company staff, including BPO staff use of client-owned hardware and client-driven 
cybersecurity processes. Generally, these contractual requirements should consider: 
• 
the use of strong authentication for access management, especially for sensitive transactions (see 
Recommendation 3.1.1); 
• 
training for BPO employees with respect to their client organization; 
• 
data handling, processing, and storage; 
• 
secure software development lifecycle (SDLC) management; 
• 
device management and compliance for BPO employees; and 
• 
co-ownership of incident response, with clear roles and responsibilities (see Recommendation 3.3.1). 
BPOs Should Establish Mature Information Sharing Relationships with their Industry Peers 
Recognizing that attackers look for sector-specific vulnerabilities, BPOs should grow and mature grassroots information 
sharing efforts, potentially establish an ISAC or ISAO (or similar trust community) that facilitates information sharing, 
develop best practices, and coordinate industry development and delivery of training based on recurring threats. 
• 
When developing pre-incident relationships, BPOs should consider ahead of time how best to engage during an 
incident. This pre-incident coordination and planning will likely improve the effectiveness of government and 
victim response and empower the U.S. government to prevent future attacks against other would-be victims. 
The U.S. Government Should Drive Mechanisms to Gain Visibility into Aggregate Risk Associated with BPOs 
The Board recommends that CISA support the establishment and operation of trust communities among BPOs and 
their clients. Additionally, CISA should encourage private sector data set creators, such as those that author threat 
intelligence summaries, to tag their underlying incident history data to get increased visibility on BPO incidents and 
support community collaboration. 
3.4. 
LAW ENFORCEMENT AND JUVENILE CYBERCRIMES DISINCENTIVES 
Disruption of threat actors and their ongoing attacks are necessary components of a resilient and robust ecosystem 
that can keep the nation safe from the type of criminal activities described in this report. This requires a collaboration 
between law enforcement, the private sector, and international partners. The ability to disrupt the attacks by Lapsus$ 
 
However, the Board’s interactions with certain victims, or lack of interactions with other victims who have declined to speak with the Board, 
reveal that more work needs to be done to ensure that concerns about legal liability relating to an intrusion, and actions that victims and 
their counsel take to minimize exposure to such liability, are still inhibiting the sharing of cybersecurity information, leading to a net negative 
for collective cybersecurity and public safety.

and related groups was complicated by several factors: the juvenile status of some of the threat actors; geographically 
dispersed threat actors; and the cross-border nature of the crimes. The following recommendations emphasize the 
need for an international and “whole-of-society” effort to mitigate these challenges. 
3.4.1. Advance “Whole-of-Society” Programs and Mechanisms for Juvenile Cybercrime Prevention and 
Intervention 
The Board recommends developing stronger U.S. juvenile cybercrime prevention and intervention programs. For 
example, the Cyber Offender Prevention Squad (COPS), part of the Dutch National High-Tech Crime Unit (NHTCU), 
started an information campaign, with workshops and an intervention program to deter young people from online 
criminal activity, offering positive and legal alternatives. Their initiatives focused on preventing potential offenders as 
well as engaging prior offenders to decrease recidivism.364 These programs arose out of a realization that young 
cybercrime offenders, unlike counterparts operating primarily in the physical world, are often able to evade parental, 
educator, community, and law enforcement scrutiny and intervention on their journey to significant cybercriminal 
activity. Despite the federal government and the private sector’s expenditure of tens of billions of dollars annually on 
cybersecurity, the Board’s inquiry did not identify any notable juvenile cybercrime prevention and intervention programs 
in the U.S. at the federal government, local government, community, or private sector level. 
• 
Congress should explore funding juvenile cybercrime prevention programs through national law enforcement 
and national grant-making programs like those managed by Department of Justice’s (DOJ) Office of Justice 
Programs (OJP), and other appropriate mechanisms.365 
• 
Although federal law enforcement often leads investigations of significant cybercrime groups targeting U.S.-
based victims, the Federal Juvenile Delinquency Act requires that most juvenile hacking prosecutions must be 
brought in state courts.366 Congress should explore funding or other mechanisms to ensure continuity and an 
eventual prosecution upon the transfer of juvenile cybercrime investigations from federal to state authorities, 
which could have the effect of more successfully deterring U.S.-based juvenile hacking and hacking-enabled 
cybercrimes and preventing recidivism. 
3.4.2. Increase Timely Reporting of Cyberattacks to Federal Responders 
Organizations experiencing cyberattacks are not currently required to report such crimes to federal law enforcement or 
any other single federal agency. Some may not clearly understand the importance of their reporting of cybercrime 
incidents to law enforcement and other federal agencies that can disrupt ongoing and future incidents and mitigate 
risks to other potential victims, thereby creating blind spots and hampering collective cybersecurity. Without 
information gathered from targeted organizations, the federal government may not be able to understand the larger 
threat landscape and may be hampered in its timely ability to warn other targeted entities; recommend mitigation 
measures; take down malicious infrastructure; seize ill-gotten cryptocurrency or fiat currency; bring those responsible to 
justice; or otherwise disrupt malicious activity. While implementation of required reporting of covered cyber incidents 
and ransom payments by covered entities under the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022 
(CIRCIA), as amended, will improve federal agencies’ visibility significantly, voluntary reporting of confirmed or 
suspected cyberattacks and suspicious activity will continue to be critical to collective cybersecurity efforts. For such 
reasons, the Board recommends private sector organizations impacted by malicious cyber activity to fortify

366 The Board examined a possible recommendation to increase deterrence for adults who may consider using a minor to commit a cyber or 
cyber-enabled crime. However, the Board noted that the United States Sentencing Guidelines already contain an enhancement for instances 
where an adult defendant “used or attempted to use a person less than eighteen years of age to commit the offense or assist in avoiding 
detection of, or apprehension for, the offense.” United States Sentencing Guidelines, § 3B1.4 (2021), and the application note provides 
further that, in an instance where a defendant uses or attempts to use more than one person less than eighteen years of age, an upward 
departure from the applicable Guidelines range may be warranted. Source: United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines Manual,

relationships with federal security and mitigation partners pre-incident and improve frequency and prompt reporting to 
such partners upon an incident occurring. 
• 
Private sector organizations should increase reporting of cyber incidents and indicators of compromise (IOCs) 
to the federal government when the organizations suspect or suffer from a cyber intrusion or attack. 
• 
Private sector organizations should report incidents in a timely fashion to enable appropriate federal 
responders to support victims and render immediate assistance. Federal responders may have specific 
knowledge about threat actors, allowing them to freeze stolen funds; provide decryption keys; take down 
malicious infrastructure like exfiltration servers, leaks sites, command-and-control (C2) infrastructure, or 
botnets; or aid a victim’s incident response team with mitigation or future resilience planning. Timely reporting 
may also support warnings and the development of mitigation recommendations to protect other potential 
victims. 
The National Cybersecurity Strategy outlines the federal government’s plan to strengthen the National Cyber Incident 
Response Plan, specifically, to further implement a policy that “a call to one is a call to all.”367 As part of that effort, the 
Board therefore recommends the U.S. government provide clear, consistent guidance, or clarify and further publicize 
existing guidance, about federal departments’ and agencies’ cyber incident-related roles and responsibilities in a highly 
visible and unified manner to improve coordination during and post cyber incidents. 
• 
Provide private and public sector partners with information concerning federal and state responder contact 
information, available services for victims, and individual agencies’ unique missions and authorities to best 
assist a targeted entity during a cyberattack. 
• 
Explain the liability and privilege protections afforded to victims and personnel that share cybersecurity-related 
information with federal responders and with each other. The Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 
(CISA 2015) provides statutory protections to non-federal entities that share cyber threat indicators and 
defensive measures in accordance with CISA 2015 with the federal government and with each other.368 
However, the lack of awareness or confusion around these provisions inhibits respondents and their legal 
counsel from reporting critical information. As CISA 2015 approaches its sunset and potential renewal in 
2025, Congress should seek out stakeholder feedback to understand why private sector entities continue to 
report cybercrimes and share cyber threat information at low levels that inhibit collective cybersecurity efforts. 
• 
Legislate to provide more protection for providers of online services whose platform security personnel identify 
evidence of a crime in online communications while conducting their standard platform protection duties. At 
least one cybersecurity researcher respondent advised the Board that their employer’s legal counsel was 
confused by the term “inadvertently” in 18 U.S. Code (U.S.C.) § 2702(b)(7)(A) and whether personnel 
conducting platform protection duties could be deemed to have “inadvertently” found information that appears 
to pertain to the commission of a crime (and thus be able to provide the contents of relevant customer 
communications to law enforcement) if those personnel were actively looking to identify and prevent such 
abuse. The researcher noted that such confusion had prevented their ability to share such information with law 
enforcement on countless occasions. 
• 
Clarify the relationship, or lack thereof, between law enforcement and federal regulators, to address private 
sector misconceptions that law enforcement is a regular conduit of information to regulators. 
The Board endorses Strategic Objective 2.1 of the National Cybersecurity Strategy (Integrate Federal Disruption 
Activities), which seeks to make federal disruption campaigns “so sustained and targeted that criminal activity is 
rendered unprofitable” while “increas[ing] the volume and speed of these integrated disruption campaigns.”369

However, the Board notes that compared to its irreplaceable role in advancing these goals and the country’s 
cybersecurity, federal law enforcement is under-resourced within the federal government. Unless Congress addresses 
this issue, no amount of increased victim reporting will accomplish the Administration’s strategic goals to dramatically 
reduce the incidence and impact of cybercrime. 
3.4.3. Increase International Law Enforcement Cooperation 
Respondents consistently noted that timely international cooperation is essential to the long-term disruption of 
cybercrime threats generally. Some respondents specifically noted that such collaboration between U.S. and 
international law enforcement partners led to the late 2022 arrest of Lapsus$ members, thereby apparently causing 
the group’s malicious activities to cease. Central to their opinions regarding the necessity for such international 
cooperation was the dispersed networks of cybercriminals and the transnational nature of online infrastructure, 
service, and digital asset technologies (and their underlying records), which require global collaboration to locate digital 
evidence, infrastructure, and persons involved in cybercrime activities. 
To improve the timeliness and effectiveness of law enforcement efforts of the type that disrupted the Lapsus$ group in 
2022, the Board endorses the law enforcement-related efforts described in Pillar 5 of the National Cybersecurity 
Strategy (Forge International Partnerships to Pursue Shared Goals) and related recommendations. 
• 
Enhance law enforcement resources devoted to international law enforcement cooperation, including 
operational collaboration against transnational cyber threats, such as FBI’s Cyber Legal Attaché program and 
dedicated federal prosecutors. 
• 
Strengthen international collaboration mechanisms to ensure effective information sharing and deconfliction 
to better prevent cybercriminals from evading the rule of law. 
3.4.4. Build Resilience for Emergency Disclosure Requests (EDRs) Against Social Engineering Attacks 
Title 18 U.S.C. § 2702 generally prohibits providers from disclosing their users’ records and communications, but 
exceptions in that statute permit providers to divulge a subscriber’s information, including the content of 
communications, to a government entity based upon the provider’s good faith belief that “an emergency involving 
danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires disclosure without delay.” Providers often decide to 
divulge records after law enforcement informs them of such an emergency through a form called an “Emergency 
Disclosure Request” (EDR). Providers may also decide to divulge records if they learn about an emergency through 
another source, such as a concerned parent. Providers are responsible for deciding whether an emergency exists and 
must assess the credibility and authenticity of anyone submitting an EDR. 
Recognizing that providers are faced with difficult choices between protecting customer privacy and preventing death or 
serious bodily injury, providers should devote appropriate resources to the task of verifying the authenticity and 
credibility of EDRs so that providers reduce mistakes in either direction. For example, providers should examine 
whether they should design and implement new mechanisms for verifying the authenticity of EDRs using solutions such 
as standardized digital signatures. These measures should: 
• 
address how threat actors have or could abuse existing EDR processes to fraudulently obtain sensitive 
information; and 
• 
assign roles and responsibilities for service providers to verify the legitimacy of EDRs.

APPENDIX B: MULTI-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION (MFA) TYPES AND RISK 
ASSESSMENT 
BACKGROUND  
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defines multi-factor authentication (MFA) as an 
authentication system that requires more than one distinct authentication factor for successful authentication. The 
three authentication factors are something you know, such as a password or personal identification number (PIN); 
something you have, like a cryptographic identification device or token; or something you are, like a biometric.372  
Organizations may differ slightly in how they categorize the various forms of MFA, but industry, European Union (EU), 
and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance is consistent with CISA’s and NIST's rankings for the following 
methods of MFA from most secure to least secure: phishing-resistant MFA; app-based MFA (differentiated further by 
number matching and push notification approaches to MFA); and Short Message Service (SMS)/voice MFA.373, 374, 375 
Figure 2 and the following sections detail the various vulnerabilities of each form of MFA and common exploitation 
methodologies.

PHISHING-RESISTANT MULTI-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION (MFA) 
Phishing-resistant MFA, including FIDO and public key infrastructure (PKI),376 which enables digital signatures and 
encryption, is currently the strongest approach to MFA with the United States (U.S.) government’s OMB requiring 
agencies to adopt the method and the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity and the Computer Emergency 
Response Team (CERT)-EU releasing a joint publication identifying it as a best practice.377, 378 FIDO, the only widely 
available phishing-resistant authentication, runs on top of the WebAuthn authentication protocol and is supported by 
major browsers, operating systems, and smartphones. PKI is less widely available but effectively ties MFA to an 
enterprise PKI infrastructure. An example of PKI-based MFA is the use of smart cards, including Common Access Card 
(CAC) or Personal Identity Verification (PIV), by many government agencies to establish the second identification 
factor.379  
APP-BASED MULTI-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION (MFA) 
As depicted in Figure 3, app-based MFA is an authentication method that uses a mobile application to provide the 
second authentication method to log in to a user’s account. App-based MFA solutions verify a user’s identity by 
generating a one-time passcode (OTP)380 or by sending a “push” notification, possibly with number matching 
implemented, to a mobile application for a user to accept. In the OTP or number matching implementation, the user has 
an additional step that requires them to type in the OTP or numbers. While they are resilient to some of the vectors 
available to SMS/voice-based MFA, OTP or number matching is still vulnerable to phishing while push notifications 
without number matching remain vulnerable to MFA fatigue attacks and user error. CISA recommends OTP or number 
matching MFA over push notification MFA because of the additional step that can mitigate against MFA fatigue and 
identifies this method as optimal for organizations that cannot immediately implement phishing-resistant MFA.381, 382 
 
376 PKI is the set of hardware, software, policies, processes, and procedures required to create, manage, distribute, use, store, and revoke 
digital certificates and public keys. PKIs are the foundation that enables the use of technologies, such as digital signatures and encryption, 
across large user populations. Source: Thales, “What is PKI and What is it used for?” https://cpl.thalesgroup.com/faq/public-key-

Figure 3 - App-based MFA 
SMS/VOICE MULTI-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION (MFA) 
NIST, CISA, and Okta are among those organizations that consider SMS/voice MFA the weakest form of MFA. 
SMS/voice MFA involves sending a code to the user’s phone or email, which the user then uses to complete their login. 
This approach to MFA is subject to relatively simple attack vectors that are easy to exploit without advanced technical 
skill, like Signaling System #7 (SS7) protocol vulnerabilities383 and, as demonstrated in many Lapsus$ attacks, social 
engineering such as Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) swapping and phishing. Although NIST, CISA, and Okta advise 
that this form of MFA should be avoided to the extent possible, they acknowledge that any MFA method is better than 
no MFA.384, 385, 386  
 
 
 
383 SS7 attacks are mobile cyberattacks that exploit security vulnerabilities in the SS7 protocol to compromise and intercept voice and SMS 
communications on a cellular network, effectively enabling the threat actor to steal the authentication message sent to a mobile device.
