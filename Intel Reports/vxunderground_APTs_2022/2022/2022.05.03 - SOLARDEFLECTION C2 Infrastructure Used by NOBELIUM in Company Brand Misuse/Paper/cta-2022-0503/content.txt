This report profiles the unique infrastructure used by Russian state-
sponsored threat activity group NOBELIUM. The activity was identified through 
a combination of large-scale automated network traffic analytics and analysis 
derived from open source reporting. Data sources include the Recorded Future 
Platform, SecurityTrails, DomainTools, PolySwarm, Farsight, Shodan, Censys, Team 
Cymru’s Pure Signal™ and other common open-source tools and techniques. The 
report will be of most interest to individuals engaged in strategic and operational 
intelligence relating to the activities of the Russian government in cyberspace and 
network defenders. Some technical details from our original research have not 
been included in this report version in order to protect tracking techniques and 
ongoing research into NOBELIUM activity. 
Executive Summary
Recorded Future’s Insikt Group continues to monitor 
Russian state-sponsored cyber espionage operations targeting 
government and private sector organizations across multiple 
geographic regions. From mid-2021 onwards, Recorded Future’s 
midpoint collection revealed a steady rise in the use of NOBELIUM 
infrastructure tracked by Insikt Group as SOLARDEFLECTION, 
which encompasses command and control (C2) infrastructure. 
In this report, we highlight trends observed by Insikt Group while 
monitoring SOLARDEFLECTION infrastructure and the recurring 
use of typosquat domains by its operators.
A key factor we have observed from NOBELIUM operators 
involved in threat activity is a reliance on domains that emulate 
other brands (some legitimate and some that are likely fictitious 
businesses). Domain registrations and typosquats can enable 
spearphishing campaigns or redirects that pose a threat to victim 
networks and brands.
Using a combination of proactive adversary infrastructure 
detections, domain analysis techniques, and Recorded Future 
Network Traffic Analysis, we have determined that NOBELIUM’s 
use of SOLARDEFLECTION infrastructure overlaps with other 
common infrastructure tactics, techniques, and procedures 
(TTPs) previously attributed to the group by multiple 
organizations including Microsoft, Fortinet, Sekoia, and Volexity. 
Previous open source reporting also highlighted NOBELIUM’s use 
of cracked versions of the Cobalt Strike penetration testing tool.
Key Judgments
•	 Insikt Group is confident that the identified 
SOLARDEFLECTION infrastructure can be attributed to 
the threat activity group publicly reported as NOBELIUM; 
this confidence is based on the use of overlapping 
network infrastructure previously attributed to NOBELIUM 
in public reporting, as well as unique variations of Cobalt 
Strike traditionally used by the group.
•	 Broader themes in SOLARDEFLECTION C2 typosquats 
have included the misuse of brands across multiple 
industry verticals, particularly in the news and media 
industries.
•	 Cobalt Strike servers related to SOLARDEFLECTION 
monitoring that were also previously linked to NOBELIUM 
activity used modified server configurations, likely in an 
attempt to remain undetected from researchers actively 
scanning for standard Cobalt Strike server features. 
•	 NOBELIUM has made extensive use of typosquat 
domains in SSL certificates and will likely continue to use 
deceptive techniques, including typosquat redirection, 
when using Cobalt Strike tooling.
Background 
Analysis of recent and historical domains attributed to 
NOBELIUM broadly demonstrates the group’s familiarity with, and 
tendency to emulate, a variety of media, news and technology 
providers. The group has abused dynamic DNS resolution to 
construct and resolve to randomly generated subdomains for 
its C2s or root domains to mislead victims. The key aspect 
to these attacks is the use of either email addresses or URLs 
that look similar to the domain of a legitimate organization. 
Potentially harmful domain registrations and typosquats can 
enable spearphishing campaigns or redirects that pose an 
elevated risk to a company’s brand or employees. A successful 
spearphish is dependent on factors such as the quality of the 
message, the credibility of the sender address, and, in the case 
of a redirecting URL, the credibility of the domain name. Insikt 
Group has previously observed other Russian nexus groups using 
typosquatting in support of operations, such as those aimed 
at the 2020 presidential elections, to increase confidence in 
the validity of the fraudulent login portal used to harvest victim 
credentials. This tactic has also been reported recently in 
open sources in connection with intrusions targeting entities in 
Ukraine, likely in support of Russia’s invasion of the country.

Insikt Group assesses that NOBELIUM is a threat activity 
group operating in line with the objectives of Russia’s Foreign 
Intelligence Service (SVR). The SVR is tasked with providing the 
president of the Russian Federation, the Federal Assembly, and 
the government with the intelligence they need to make decisions 
in the areas of politics, the economy, military strategy, scientific-
technical strategy, and the environment. Russia’s SVR defines 
itself as separate by allowing the Russian Main Intelligence 
Directorate (GRU) to focus on military intelligence operations, 
while the SVR focuses on political intelligence; this is, however, 
a very high-level view of these operations. The SVR conducts 
its affairs by collecting information via public and private means, 
with the intended goal of gathering strategic information from 
organizations and individuals who in turn influence strategic 
policy and decision-makers in targeted countries. 
In 2021, Volexity published research outlining a suspected 
APT29 phishing operation that targeted non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs), research institutions, governments, 
and international bodies using election fraud-themed lures 
purporting to be sent from the United States Agency for 
International Development (USAID), a government agency. 
The same day, Microsoft also published research on wider 
TTPs used in the same campaign and attributed the activity to 
NOBELIUM, the group behind the SolarWinds intrusions. This 
campaign targeted sensitive diplomatic and government entities 
as early as February 2021. They believe the threat actor used 
this information to launch other highly targeted attacks as part 
of their broader campaign. Additional research confirmed that 
a cluster of infrastructure monitored by Insikt Group under the 
designation SOLARDEFLECTION since 2021 overlaps with this 
previous reporting. Ongoing detections within the Recorded 
Future Command and Control security feed assisted in confirming 
the registration of new typosquat domains tied to NOBELIUM 
operations. More notably, we have confirmed that several newly 
identified typosquats continue to adopt the naming conventions 
or themes that were originally flagged as likely being associated 
with NOBELIUM reporting as early as 2020.
The Recorded Future Platform automatically detects 
typosquatted domains; each newly created domain entity is 
evaluated for typosquatting-style similarity to other domains 
observed by Recorded Future. An example of this is the 
SOLARDEFLECTION typosquat displayed in Figure 1, which 
based on the domain’s spelling was very likely an attempt by 
NOBELIUM operators to emulate the T-Mobile brand. A review 
of the frequency in which SOLARDEFLECTION domains were 
registered over the past two years confirmed NOBELIUM’s 
tendency to register domains in cycles, occasionally taking short 
hiatuses which at times likely coincided with new open source 
reporting attributing several domains to NOBELIUM activity (as 
depicted within the Recorded Future timeline below).
Insikt Group proactively detects SOLARDEFLECTION 
infrastructure through an in-depth understanding of the 
infrastructure TTPs that the group employs (detailed further 
below within the Infrastructure TTPs section). Additionally, the 
Command and Control data set enables us to enrich and identify 
any SOLARDEFLECTION IPs that we have categorized as “positive 
C2”. We then analyze network communications to investigate 
how the C2 is interacting with infected machines or how it is 
being administered by the adversary. SOLARDEFLECTION C2s 
can be reviewed from within the Recorded Future Platform’s 
Command and Control data set. 
Threat Analysis
SOLARDEFLECTION Overview
NOBELIUM employs a wide range of bespoke tooling 
developed in a variety of programming languages, demonstrating 
a substantial research and development effort in support of 
its cyber operations. The threat group also makes good use 
of publicly available commodity tools such as Cobalt Strike to 
hinder attribution efforts. NOBELIUM exhibits highly developed 
operational security practices in its tradecraft, aimed at 
disrupting researchers’ efforts in associating their malware and 
infrastructure to the group. Using a combination of proactive 
C2 detections, domain analysis, and network traffic analysis, 
we have determined that SOLARDEFLECTION servers share 
common infrastructure TTPs, enabling us to confidently cluster 
and attribute these servers to NOBELIUM.

Using current DNS records and passive DNS sources, 
we resolved IPs for newly registered domains tracked as 
SOLARDEFLECTION since January 2022 and reviewed SSL 
certificate information associated with these IPs. As a result, 
we discovered several domains via SOLARDEFLECTION tracking 
(see Appendix A) and a continued trend of using both Namesilo 
and Namecheap for domain registration. The reason behind the 
preference for these registrars is unknown; all domains collected 
under SOLARDEFLECTION had domain privacy options enabled.
Analysis of the domains covered under SOLARDEFLECTION 
highlighted a trend around the use of themed domains, primarily 
emulating entities within the media and news industry, as well 
as a smaller nexus around business development-themed 
domains. Both of these themes have been documented in open 
source reporting in connection with known NOBELIUM activity. 
The reason behind these theme choices is not fully understood 
beyond the suspected attempt to masquerade as other brands 
to appear legitimate to targets.
LUNARREFLECTION
While developing our original detection logic for 
SOLARDEFLECTION, we observed a secondary cluster of 
infrastructure that deviated technically from the main cluster. 
However, it contained domains bearing similarities to those used 
within SOLARDEFLECTION, and we believe this cluster is also likely 
managed by NOBELIUM operators. The similarities include the 
use of registrars Namecheap and Namesilo and domain themes 
that overlap with those identified within SOLARDEFLECTION 
domain registrations. Recorded Future tracks this secondary 
cluster under the name LUNARREFLECTION. An aggregation of 
discovered LUNARREFLECTION C2s is provided in Appendix A. 
As seen in the industry breakdown in Figure 4 below, there is 
a similar trend among LUNARREFLECTION domains that emulate 
entities within the news and media industries. However, given 
the volume of SOLARDEFLECTION and LUNARREFLECTION 
typosquats in these industries, it is important to emphasize 
that the industry being emulated does not necessarily equate 
to that industry being targeted. Domains themed around news 
and media industry contacts are very likely to be used to target 
entities across a wider spectrum of industries, including those 
that have been consistently of interest to NOBELIUM operators, 
such as government embassies.

Infrastructure TTPs
Recorded Future continues to monitor NOBELIUM by distilling 
vast swaths of open source and technical data and combining it 
with analysts’ intimate knowledge of attacker tradecraft. Network 
Traffic Analysis analytics enable users to investigate and track 
suspected targeted intrusion activity derived from validated 
technical data sources. We apply a series of filters and algorithms 
to spot suspicious network traffic concerning these detected 
malicious servers, highlighting possible targeted intrusion 
activity. Intelligence Card extensions within the Recorded Future 
Platform then allow users to enrich this information further using 
data from close partners such as SecurityTrails, thereby enabling 
Recorded Future Threat Intelligence module users to efficiently 
map out prospective adversary campaigns.
Over the course of our research, Insikt Group observed 
multiple uncommon characteristics unique to NOBELIUM that 
serve as distinguishable hallmarks in terms of our potential to 
track this activity long term. The elements described below are 
some of the trackable characteristics which have been found 
to be used when investigating NOBELIUM-linked infrastructure 
with the resulting derived infrastructure covered under 
SOLARDEFLECTION and LUNARREFLECTION.

a n a l y z i n g  
S O L A R D E F L E C T I O N -  
a n d 
LUNARREFLECTION-related HTTP banner data, significant 
mistakes were observed and were found to be consistent 
across all related discovered infrastructure. A related trend 
involves the consistent use of specifically customized SSL 
certificates. Although these customizations are not unique to 
only SOLARDEFLECTION and LUNARREFLECTION instances 
on their own, the particular curation style of these certificates 
is uncommon and is a practice found consistently across all 
discovered infrastructure.
Also found consistently in SOLARDEFLECTION and 
LUNARREFLECTION infrastructure is a mismatch between 
the SSL certificate Subject CN (Common Name) and the 302 
redirection location. Further investigation of the redirect location 
domain shows that the referenced URI is a legitimate resource 
for a fully functioning website; however, the Subject CN-related 
domain is typically found to have no significant website data 
associated with it.
Activity Spotlight: Role of Cobalt Strike
Some of the key characteristics used for SOLARDEFLECTION 
and LUNARREFLECTION have been the prevalent use of specific 
Cobalt Strike instances, including custom payload configurations, 
unique SSL certificates, and the likely use of cs2modrewrite 
to obfuscate C2 traffic. Cobalt Strike servers previously linked 
to NOBELIUM activity used modified server configurations 
to remain undetected by security researchers monitoring for 
standard Cobalt Strike server features. NOBELIUM has made 
extensive use of typosquat domains in SSL certificates and has 
used deceptive techniques including redirection when using 
Cobalt Strike tooling. 
Analyzing infrastructure clustered under SOLARDEFLECTION 
and LUNARREFLECTION revealed hallmarks that pointed to the 
likely use of cs2modrewrite, a modification technique for Cobalt 
Strike-based infrastructure developed by members of Threat 
Express, an information security blog “created by red teamers, 
penetration testers and security professionals”. 
Details of the functionality of cs2modrewrite from its GitHub 
repository state, “This project converts a Cobalt Strike profile to 
a functional mod_rewrite .htaccess or Nginx config file to support 
HTTP reverse proxy redirection to a Cobalt Strike TeamServer. 
The use of reverse proxies provides protection to backend 
C2 servers from profiling, investigation, and general internet 
background radiation”. Infrastructure linked to cs2modrewrite 
instances can be set up in several different ways, including 
separating the hosting of the reverse proxy server and Cobalt 
Strike server, or co-hosting the reverse proxy and Cobalt Strike 
on the same server. 
Of particular interest in the repository is the file “cs2nginx.
py”, which was last updated February 5, 2020, and whose 
comment description states, “Converts Cobalt Strike profiles to 
Nginx config file format (/etc/nginx/nginx.conf)”. The resulting 
Nginx configs will “Attempt to serve files locally if they exist”, 
“Proxy any matching URIs to the C2 server”, and “Redirect any 
non-matching requests to a specified redirection domain along 
with the original URI”.
Analysis of cs2nginx functionality and comments reveals 
options for modification to Nginx Cobalt Strike servers that match 
infrastructure discovered via SOLARDEFLECTION. Insikt Group 
identified several methods of identifying network infrastructure 
used by NOBELIUM in their intrusion operations, based on the 
information published by Microsoft and analysis of the groups’ 
infrastructure TTPs such as banner data.

Recurring Use of COSMICNODE 
Analysis of NOBELIUM infrastructure identified multiple 
loader samples written using unique unpacking code used to 
deploy Cobalt Strike Beacons and shellcode that Insikt Group 
internally tracks as COSMICNODE. COSMICNODE is likely an 
evolution of the family tracked by Sentinel One in connection 
with NobleBaron and by Microsoft as NativeZone. Microsoft 
has previously stated that NativeZone encompasses multiple 
instances of NOBELIUM’s custom Cobalt Strike loaders, making 
it an umbrella term for any variant, to include one of the several 
named families detailed further below. COSMICNODE typically 
uses rundll32.exe to load and execute follow-on payload(s).
As of this publication, the COSMICNODE family continues 
to use new anti-analysis, encryption, and obfuscation methods 
to disguise the Cobalt Strike payloads and hamper static 
detection of the COSMICNODE implants. NOBELIUM has used 
AES encryption, byte swapping, multi-stage XOR encoding, and 
other obfuscation methods, suggesting a deep understanding of 
how to hinder defender efforts to detect and analyze payloads. 
Malleable Cobalt Strike C2 Profiles enable operators to customize 
the details of the command and control protocol used. The Cobalt 
Strike payloads have predominantly used one of two watermarks 
associated with leaked builds, 1359593325 or 305419896, and 
the standard jQuery malleable profile that helps traffic blend 
in by mimicking legitimate services. The previously mentioned 
theme around typosquats of news-related entities carried over 
into both SOLARDEFLECTION and LUNARREFLECTION C2 server 
URLs that contained similar strings pertaining to “news” or “info” 
topics, including:
•	 sampledomain[.]com,/news/update/aaa
•	 sampledomain[.]com,/news_indexedimages_autrzd/
Infrastructure that did not meet the criteria for either 
SOLARDEFLECTION or LUNARREFLECTION, but matched 
signaturing for cs2modrewrite instances, which are likely to be 
Cobalt Strike servers, are aggregated in Appendix A.

Victimology
With the finite data available to Recorded Future surrounding 
this campaign, limited conclusions can be drawn regarding 
victimology. Through behavioral profiling of network traffic to 
adversary infrastructure, we were able to determine a clear and 
consistent pattern of SOLARDEFLECTION operators relying on 
Tor to obfuscate network traffic. 
Overlaps with the HTML variant of EnvyScout detailed by 
Sekoia[.]io and findings from other researchers provide invaluable 
insight into likely lures such as those suspected to have targeted 
multiple embassies. Following this first discovery, other similar 
HTML files reported by Sekoia confirmed a possible targeting 
theme centered on “Covid information” based on the title of an 
HTML file they attributed to this campaign. This aligns with the 
themes of the phishing emails they attributed to this campaign, 
likely targeting embassies that pretended to be providing a status 
update about embassy operations in response to the pandemic. 
Mitigations
The delivery of the Cobalt Strike Beacon malware and the 
C2 communication (defined by the malleable C2 profile) are best 
detected using intrusion detection systems (IDS) like Snort. We 
recommend that users conduct the following measures to detect 
and mitigate activity associated with SOLARDEFLECTION: 
•	 Configure your intrusion detection systems (IDS), 
intrusion prevention systems (IPS), or any network 
defense mechanisms in place to alert on — and upon 
review, consider blocking connection attempts to and 
from — the external IP addresses and domains listed in 
the appendix.
•	 Recorded Future proactively detects and logs malicious 
server configurations in the Command and Control 
Security Control Feed. The Command and Control list 
includes tools used by NOBELIUM and other Russian 
state-sponsored threat activity groups. Recorded Future 
clients should alert on and block these C2 servers to 
allow for detection and remediation of active intrusions.
•	 Recorded Future Threat Intelligence (TI), Third-Party 
Intelligence, and SecOps Intelligence module users can 
monitor real-time output from Network Traffic Analysis 
analytics to identify suspected targeted intrusion activity 
involving your organization or key vendors and partners.
● Monitor for domain abuse, such as typosquat 
domains spoofing your organization, through the 
Recorded Future Brand Intelligence (BI) module. 
The SecurityTrails extension is available to any 
customer that has a subscription to the Threat 
Intelligence or Brand Intelligence modules. The 
LogoType source and alerting is exclusive to the 
BI module, though the TI module does have ac­
cess to the data via the Advanced Query Builder.

Outlook
As tensions continue to rise in Eastern Europe, we expect 
to see a continuation of cyber operations being conducted by 
Russian-nexus groups, likely including NOBELIUM, in line with 
national strategic interests. Russia will likely also continue to 
exert influence over other governments, which may lead to 
additional computer network operations aimed at furthering 
strategic advantage. Typosquatting is likely to remain an integral 
technique for multiple threat entities supporting Russian national 
interests in the near future. Insikt Group has already observed 
groups that support these interests weaponize domains themed 
around Russia’s invasion of Ukraine to great effect. This likely 
includes not only the domains belonging to one organization, 
but third-party partners and vendors with enterprise network 
access.
