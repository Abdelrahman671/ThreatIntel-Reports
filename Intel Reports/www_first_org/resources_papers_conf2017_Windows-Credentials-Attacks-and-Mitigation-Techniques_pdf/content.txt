• Priority #1 post-exploitation
• Domain admin is ultimate goal
• Nearly everything in Windows is tied to an account
• Difficult to move without one
• Easy and relatively stealthy means to traverse the network
• Account limitations are rare
• “Sleeper” credentials can provide access after remediation

Evolution of Credential Attack Mitigation

Compromising Credentials: Hashes
The password for each user account in Windows is stored in 
multiple formats: LM and NT hashes are most well known.  
TsPkg, WDigest, and LiveSSP can be decrypted to 
provide plaintext passwords (prior to Win8.1)  
How are they acquired and used? Hashes are available 
in the LSASS process and can be extracted with admin 
privileges.  Once dumped, hashes can be cracked or used 
immediately in a Pass the Hash attack.

• Prevent admin account compromise
• Stop remote interactive sessions with highly 
privileged accounts
• Proper termination of RDP sessions
• Win8.1+ force the use of Restricted Admin?
• Win10 deploy Remote Credential Guard
• Upgrade to Windows 10
• Credential Guard
• TsPkg, WDigest, etc. -- SSO creds obsolescence
• Domain Protected Users Group (PtH mitigation)

12
Compromising Credentials: Tokens
Delegate tokens are powerful authentication resources 
used for SSO.  They allow attackers to impersonate a 
user’s security context, including over the network. 
How are they acquired and used? The 
SeImpersonate privilege lets tokens be copied from 
processes.  The new token can then be used to 
authenticate as the new user.  A target user or service 
must be logged on or have running processes.

• Win8.1+ force the use of Restricted Admin Mode?
• Win10 deploy Remote Credential Guard
• Account designation of “Account is Sensitive and 
Cannot be Delegated” in Active Directory
• Domain Protected Users security group accounts do 
not create delegate tokens
Defending Credentials: Tokens 
16
Compromising Credentials: Cached Credentials
Stored domain credentials to allow logons when 
domain controller access is unavailable.  Most systems 
cache the last 10 logon hashes by default.
How are they acquired and used?  Cached 
credentials must be cracked. Hashes are salted and 
case-sensitive, making decryption very slow.  These 
hashes cannot be used for Pass the Hash attacks.

Local NT Hashes
Cached Hashes
• Prevent admin account compromise
• Limit number of cached logon accounts
• SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\Current Version\Winlogon
(cachedlogonscount value)
• A cachedlogonscount of zero or one is not always the right answer
• Enforce password length and complexity rules
• Brute force cracking is required for this attack
• Domain Protected Users security group accounts do 
not cache credentials
Defending Credentials: Cached Credentials
20
Compromising Credentials: LSA Secrets
Credentials stored in the registry to allow services or 
tasks to be run with user privileges.  In addition to 
service accounts, may also hold application 
passwords like VPN or auto-logon credentials.
How are they acquired and used? Administrator 
privileges allow access to encrypted registry data and 
the keys necessary to decrypt. Passwords are plaintext

• Prevent admin account compromise
• Do not employ services or schedule tasks               
requiring privileged accounts on low trust systems
• Reduce number of services that require domain 
accounts to execute
• Heavily audit any accounts that must be used
• (Group) Managed Service Accounts
Defending Credentials: LSA Secrets
23
Compromising Credentials: Tickets
Kerberos issues tickets to authenticated users that can 
be reused without additional authentication.  Tickets 
are cached in memory and are valid for 10 hours.
How are they acquired and used? Tickets can be 
stolen from memory and used to authenticate 
elsewhere (Pass the Ticket).  Further, access to the DC 
allows tickets to be created for any user with no 
expiration (Golden Ticket).  Service account tickets can 
be requested and forged, including offline cracking of 
service account hashes (Kerberoasting).

NTDS.DIT
Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) database holds 
all user and computer account hashes (LM/NT) in the 
domain.  Encrypted, but algorithm is well known and easy 
to defeat.
How is it acquired and used? Located in the 
\Windows\NTDS folder on the domain controller.  The 
file is locked, so admin access is required to load a driver to 
access raw disk, or use the Volume Shadow Copy Service.

Credential Attack Detection
33
“As any pass-the-ticket attack, the attacker replays
the golden ticket in a standard Kerberos protocol.
Therefore, there is no clear indication of such attack
in Windows logs.”
34
“Golden Ticket events may have one of these issues:
The Account Domain field is blank when it should 
be DOMAIN
The Account Domain field is DOMAIN FQDN when it 
should be DOMAIN.”  –Sean Metcalf, adsecurity.org

Credential Best Practices
49
Restrict and Protect Privileged Domain Accounts
• Reduce the number of Domain/Enterprise Admins
• Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all network 
and cloud admin accounts
• Separate administrative accounts from user accounts for 
administrative personnel
• Create specific administrative workstation hosts for 
administrators
• Use the Domain Protected Users security group!
Best Practices: Control Your Admin Accounts
50
Limit Local Admin Accounts
• Don’t give users admin
• Unique and complex 
passwords for local admin   
(LAPS)
• Deny network logons for 
local accounts
Audit account usage and 
monitor for anomalies

Securing Privileged Access Reference Material by 
Corey Plett (Microsoft)
• Audit and limit the number of services running as 
system and domain accounts
• Utilize Group Managed Service Accounts
• … or regularly change and use long & complex passwords 
• Upgrade to Windows 10 /Server 2016
• Enable Credential Guard &  Remote Credential Guard
• Force LSASS as protected process on legacy Win8.1 
• Establish remote connections using network logon 
instead of interactive logon when possible
Best Practices: Reduce the Credential Attack Surface
53
• Limit workstation to workstation communication 
• Restrict inbound NetBIOS, SMB traffic using the Windows 
Firewall
• … or VLAN segmentation of workstations
• So many hack tools leverage SMB authentication
• Is workstation to workstation RDP really necessary?
• Enable stricter Kerberos security
• Disable LM & NTLM (force Kerberos)
• Short validity for tickets 
• No account delegation
