LightSpy Returns: Renewed Espionage Campaign Targets
Southern Asia, Possibly India
Dmitry Melikov ⋮ ⋮ 4/11/2024
Summary
This report details the resurgence of the LightSpy mobile espionage campaign, which focuses on targets
in Southern Asia and probably India, potentially indicating a renewed focus on political targets and
tensions in the region.
Beyond our findings, the echoes of concern reach further. VirusTotal submissions from India suggest
potential victims within its borders, aligning with recent warnings by Apple on detections within the same
country.  
What is LightSpy?
LightSpy is a sophisticated iOS implant, first reported in 2020 in connection with a watering-hole attack
against Apple device users. Specifically, it is a fully-featured modular surveillance toolset that primarily
focuses on exfiltrating victims’ private information, including hyper-specific location data and sound
recording during voice over IP (VOIP) calls. This makes it particularly dangerous to victims, with as many
2/10
consequences as can be imagined relating to a threat actor being able to locate their target with near-
perfect accuracy.
LightSpy possesses modules designed to exfiltrate device information and saved files, including data
from popular messenger applications such as QQ, WeChat, and Telegram. It also has a plugin capable of
crawling the payment history of the victim from WeChat Pay (Weixin Pay in China). It can additionally
access a user’s contacts, SMS messages, phone call history, GPS location, connected WiFi history, and
the browser history of Safari and Chrome. This comprehensive set of features can turn a user’s infected
phone into a potent spying device.
The last campaign attributed to the attacker behind LightSpy was in 2020, amid escalating political
tensions in Hong Kong. The malicious implants were distributed through “poisoned” news sites focused
on polarizing issues in the Hong Kong region. The threat actor group thought to be behind this LightSpy
campaign reportedly had active servers in China, Singapore, and Russia.
Key Findings
LightSpy is back: After several months of curious inactivity, the advanced mobile spyware has
resurfaced, targeting individuals in Southern Asia.
Expanded capabilities: The latest iteration of LightSpy, dubbed "F_Warehouse", boasts a modular
framework with extensive spying features, including:
File theft: LightSpy is capable of stealing files from various popular apps like Telegram, QQ,
WeChat, and also targets personal documents and media.
Audio recording: LightSpy can secretly record audio from the infected device.
Data harvesting: LightSpy can collect and exfiltrate browser history, WiFi connection lists,
installed application details, and even pictures from the device's camera.
System access: LightSpy can retrieve user KeyChain data and device lists, and execute
shell commands for potential full device control.
Chinese origins: Evidence such as code comments and error messages strongly suggest
the attackers behind LightSpy are native Chinese speakers, raising concerns about potential
state-sponsored activity.
Advanced techniques: LightSpy employs certificate pinning to prevent detection and interception
of communication with its command-and-control (C2) server. Thus, if the victim is on a network
where traffic is being analyzed, no connection to the C2 server will be established.
Implications
The reemergence of LightSpy highlights the ongoing threat of sophisticated mobile spyware used for
espionage purposes. The targeting of individuals in Southern Asia, coupled with the suspected Chinese
origin of the attackers, raises concerns about the potential motives and geopolitical implications of this
campaign.
Though typically deployed against a very small percentage of individuals – most usually journalists,
activists, politicians and diplomats – hyper-focused spyware attacks are an ongoing and global threat. In
recent months, many technology firms have cautioned about the risk of state-sponsored efforts to sway
certain electoral outcomes.
3/10
“The extreme cost, sophistication and worldwide nature of mercenary spyware attacks makes them some
of the most advanced digital threats in existence today,” Apple wrote in its latest advisory.
Technical Details
Infection vector: Based on previous campaigns, initial infection likely occurs through compromised news
websites carrying stories related to Hong Kong.
Weaponization: The attack involves a first-stage implant that gathers device information and downloads
further stages, including the core LightSpy implant and various plugins for specific spying functions.

Conclusion
The return of LightSpy, now equipped with the versatile “F_Warehouse” framework, signals an escalation
in mobile espionage threats. The expanded capabilities of the malware, including extensive data
exfiltration, audio surveillance, and potential full device control, pose a severe risk to targeted
individuals and organizations in Southern Asia.
The evidence pointing towards Chinese-speaking developers, coupled with the precise targeting of
individuals potentially involved in political activism and sensitive activities, raises concerns about the
potential involvement of state-sponsored actors and the geopolitical motivations behind the campaign.
This highlights the need for increased vigilance and robust security measures, particularly for individuals
and organizations operating in the targeted region.
The modular nature of LightSpy suggests that its capabilities could evolve further, making it crucial to stay
informed about the latest developments and indicators of compromise. By understanding the tactics and
techniques employed by this advanced spyware, we can work towards mitigating its impact and
safeguarding sensitive information.
Recommendations:
Exercise heightened vigilance: Individuals and organizations in Southern Asia, especially those
involved in sensitive activities or political activism, should be particularly cautious about potentially
being targeted by LightSpy.
Use of Lockdown mode: Apple recommends individuals who may be targeted by this type of
spyware to enable Lockdown Mode to reduce their attack surface. When Lockdown Mode is
enabled, certain apps, websites, and features are strictly limited for security and some experiences
might not be available at all.
10/10
Use highly secure voice and messaging solutions: BlackBerry customers can use
SecuSUITE® to encrypt the conversations of its technology and cyber leaders wherever they
communicate – in the workplace, at home or travelling abroad.
Review the latest threat intelligence: Stay informed about the latest threats and vulnerabilities
via reports offered by reliable security researchers and organizations.
Create an incident response plan: Develop a comprehensive incident response plan to
effectively address potential cyberattacks.
In addition, it is recommended that individuals follow security best practices for mobile devices, which
include:
Update your devices: Ensure you install the latest software, because that will include the latest
security fixes.
Use a passcode: Protect devices by setting a passcode that will prevent unauthorized physical
usage.
Enable 2FA: Use two-factor authentication and a strong password for your Apple ID.
Beware of unofficial software: Install apps from the App Store only; don’t be tempted by “free”
software offered elsewhere on the web.
Password hygiene: Use strong and unique passwords online, and don’t reuse the same password
across multiple sites. Better yet, we strongly encourage the use of passwordless (e.g. FIDO2)
authentication whenever possible.
Think before you click: Don’t click on links or attachments from unknown senders. Remember;
this now applies just as much on your mobile device as it does on your personal computer.
Restart your phone often: In some cases, restarting your mobile device can help you remove or
disable some types of malware.
The BlackBerry Research and Intelligence team would like to thank Dmitry Bestuzhev for his
contributions to this report.
