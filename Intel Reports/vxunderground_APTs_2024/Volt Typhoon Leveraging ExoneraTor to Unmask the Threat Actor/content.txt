ExoneraTor is a service provided by The Tor Project that helps determine whether a specific IP address was part of
the Tor network on a given date. It serves as a valuable tool for law enforcement agencies and individuals who need
to verify the association of an IP address with Tor activity.

ExoneraTor is a tool provided by The Tor Project that helps determine whether a specific IP address was part of the
Tor network on a given date. It can be used in investigations to:
1. If an IP address is suspected of being involved in Tor-related activities, ExoneraTor can confirm or deny its
association with the Tor network.
2. It can help track the movement and configuration of Tor relays over time, providing insights into the network’s
infrastructure.
3. ExoneraTor can be used to investigate cases where online anonymity is suspected to be involved, such as
criminal activities or whistleblower disclosures.
4. It can be a valuable tool in digital forensics investigations, helping to identify and analyze Tor-related artifacts.
By providing information about the historical association of IP addresses with the Tor network, ExoneraTor can assist
in various investigations and help shed light on online activities that may involve the use of Tor.
Let’s use an example to identify a Tor IP address.
According to The Tor Project’s ExoneraTor tool, the IP address (example ip = 67.205.139.175) was not functioning as
a Tor exit relay between December 28 and 30, 2023. However, during this time, it was operating as a different type of
Tor relay with the fingerprint C899F20DC8005037C86B0E447857383D95FC7422. You can find more details about
this relay’s configuration by searching for its fingerprint on the Tor Metrics portal.

About Volt Typhoon:
Volt Typhoon is a state-sponsored cyber espionage group that has been active since at least 2021, and is believed to
be affiliated with the Chinese government
Volt Typhoon is known to primarily target the United States and the manufacturing, utility, transportation, construction,
maritime, government, information technology, and education sectors. Volt Typhoon focuses on espionage, data theft,
and credential access.
Lets not deviate from Topic.
3/6
The IP address which we took as an example belongs to a Threat Actor “VOLT TYPHOON”.
Anyways we are halfway on to the investigation.
Interestingly, Tor Metrics indicates that the Tor relay with fingerprint
C899F20DC8005037C86B0E447857383D95FC7422 first appeared on January 10, 2024. This conflicts with
Security Scorecard’s report.
DCSO believes this discrepancy may be due to a bug in Tor Metrics. ExoneraTor confirms a live Tor relay with the
same fingerprint at the same IP address in December 2023. Additionally, historical traffic data shows continuous
activity dating back to at least August 31, 2022.
However, it seems the relay was never configured as a Tor exit node. This means standard Tor clients wouldn’t
have used it to route traffic to the regular internet. Furthermore, the relay’s configuration explicitly rejects such
connections. DCSO’s analysis of raw Tor network data supports this conclusion.
If 67.205.139.175 didn’t host a Tor exit node, Volt Typhoon may not have used Tor’s internet connectivity
features. This could mean they didn’t attempt to hide their source IP while performing administrative tasks. The exact
implications of this finding are uncertain and require further investigation.
Hypothesis A: 45.63.60.39 is Using or Connecting to a Hidden Service
4/6
DCSO initially theorized that 45.63.60.39 might be operating a Hidden Service or frequently connecting to one. In this
scenario, 67.205.139.175 could have been one of 45.63.60.39’s Entry Guards.
Tor relays must meet specific criteria to become Entry Guards, including stability, bandwidth, and uptime.
C899F20DC8005037C86B0E447857383D95FC7422 meets these requirements and is flagged as a Guard, making it
eligible for use by Tor clients. In December 2023, there was a 0.08% to 0.1% chance of a random Tor client choosing
C899F20DC8005037C86B0E447857383D95FC7422 as an Entry Guard.
If Hypothesis A is correct, Volt Typhoon might be managing some of its command-and-control (C2) infrastructure
through a Hidden Service. This aligns with previous reports on their tactics.
Hidden Services offer benefits, such as keeping traffic within the Tor network and making applications harder
to attack. For example, the Terrapin attack against SSH is ineffective when SSH is used with Hidden Services.
However, Hidden Services also have drawbacks, including lower bandwidth, higher latency, and reliance on
multiple Tor relays. These factors can make interactive applications like SSH less efficient.
Superficial investigations might dismiss network communication involving Tor relays. Such connections often
originate from Tor traffic and can be difficult to trace.
The Tor Project’s FAQ mentions that running your own Tor relay can increase resilience against certain traffic
correlation attacks. This is because an adversary may struggle to determine if a connection comes from the relay
itself or from a Tor user on the same network.
Hypothesis B: Volt Typhoon is Running Tor Relays as a Disguise
5/6
However, Tor Hidden Services have several downsides, including lower bandwidth, higher latency, and reliance on
the reliability of all Tor relays used for a connection (the “circuit” in Tor jargon). For interactive applications like SSH,
the high latency can make usage cumbersome.
Superficial investigations might dismiss network communication involving Tor relays. Such connections often
originate from Tor traffic and can be difficult to trace.
The Tor Project’s FAQ mentions that running your own Tor relay can increase resilience against certain traffic
correlation attacks. This is because an adversary may struggle to determine if a connection comes from the relay
itself or from a Tor user on the same network.
For example, an attacker with control over a few Tor relays might see a connection from you but be unable to
determine if it originated from your computer or was relayed by someone else.
The specific attacks you’re concerned about play a significant role. For most users, running a relay is still a good
idea.
This works best with Tor exit relays but isn’t foolproof, especially for investigators with access to comprehensive
network data.
Conclusion
Based on the ExoneraTor results and the Tor network consensus data analyzed, it seems unlikely that
67.205.139.175 was used by Volt Typhoon as a Tor exit relay to obfuscate the origin of connections to the C2 server
located at 45.63.60.39.
However, even if this initial assessment is correct, more information is needed to definitively confirm or rule out either
Hypothesis A or B. This includes details like port numbers and traffic metadata.
Detecting and Hunting scenarios:
Implement Effective Living off the Land (LOTL) Detection Strategies
To enhance LOTL threat detection, prioritize implementing the recommendations outlined in the joint guide
“Identifying and Mitigating Living off the Land Techniques.” Many organizations struggle with LOTL detection due to
inadequate security practices and a lack of established baselines. This makes it challenging to differentiate between
legitimate and malicious behavior, hindering effective behavior analytics, anomaly detection, and proactive hunting.
6/6
Traditional IOCs often fall short in identifying LOTL attacks, complicating detection efforts. This advisory offers a
comprehensive cybersecurity strategy incorporating behavior analytics, anomaly detection, and proactive hunting to
mitigate LOTL threats effectively.
