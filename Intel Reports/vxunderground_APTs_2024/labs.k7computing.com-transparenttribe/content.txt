Transparent Tribe targets recent Election Results
By Dhanush ⋮ ⋮ 7/23/2024
Recently, we saw a tweet about a document claiming to be reporting about the recent  “Indian Election Results”. On
analysis, we found that it was dropping a “Crimson RAT” payload. This RAT, mostly used by the Transparent Tribe
APT, is capable of stealing credentials and other sensitive information. While checking the IOC’s related to this
Crimson RAT, we also noticed that there was another Excel file which was disguised as “Syllabus of a University in
Delhi”. 
This blog gets into the technical details of this document having a Crimson RAT payload.
Figure 1: Tweet
Transparent Tribe APT
Transparent Tribe, a group believed to operate out of Pakistan, has been active since 2013. Their primary focus is on
infiltrating diplomatic, defence, and research entities located in India and Afghanistan. This time election results were
used as a bait to target Indian netizens.
Technical Details
The initial vector was a .docm file which has by default macro enabled setting. This document file contains embedded
files, which includes the “Crimson RAT” payload and the Election results document.
Figure 2: Embedded files
After extracting the macro contents from the document using olevba, it copies the files into the folder named
Data(sec)(min).

Figure 3: Copies the files to appdata
Here, it checks for the Office version and decodes the embedded files using oleobject7, oleobject10 and oleobject11.
All the three files contain a base64 encoded zip file having the “Crimson RAT” payload.
Figure 4: Checks for Office version
In the revdbndfile function, it reads contents of one of the oleobject.bin and converts it into a string. The Decabav6f
function (seen in Fig 5) is used to convert the base64 encoded string into a byte array by setting its datatype as
base64. The BirvTrving function (seen in Fig 5) is later used to convert it back into a string by iterating through each
byte.
Figure 5: Base64 decoding
After decoding the base64 string, it is written to the Appdata folder. It then copies and decompresses it into the
Documents folder as a screensaver file “hacrvidth vibev.scr” and executes it.

Simultaneously, it executes another embedded doc file(oleobject3.bin), which is actually the decoy file having the
election results of Uttarakhand.

As said, another Excel file disguised as the syllabus of a university also drops the same Crimson RAT. Here is the
content of the decoy file.

Crimson RAT
The payload, on execution, sleeps for about 25 minutes, so as to hinder sandboxing. It then adds a run registry of the
current user with a random hardcoded name for persistence.

Once again, it sleeps for about 20 minutes before it tries to connect to its C2 from the hardcoded domain and IP. If the
payload does not connect to the attacker, the process exits.

Figure 13: Hardcoded C2
On connecting to the C2 server, the command and data to the process (getsEtype Func) are sent. The malware then
modifies the commands by inserting an integer value 5 before the 4th character and executing the code by comparing
with the received commands. If the attacker sends a null command, the process exits.

 These are the following C2 commands which could be executed.
thy5umb
Sends the picture back to c2 in gif
gey5tavs, pry5ocl
Gets the list of all running process
scy5uren, scy5ren, scyr5en, scyu5ren,
cdy5crgn, csy5crgn, csy5dcrgn
Takes a screenshot and sends it back in jpeg
puy5tsrt
Creates a run registry key
doy5wf
Writes data into a file from the given path
diy5rs
Retrieves the list of Drives in the system
fiy5lsz
Gets info of a file from the system
iny5fo
Gets the OS info, User Domain and Username info.
liy5stf
Gets the file path and file info from all the sub directories
which has extension, from the given path
fly5es
Check for the files in the given directory
ruy5nf
Ability to run commands
udy5lt
Writes data into the file(itaivsasidr.exe) in the same
folder as this file(Document folder)
fiy5le, afy5ile
Sends the contents of a file which path was given
dey5lt
Delete a file in the given path
6/6
doy5wr
Writes data into a file from the given path
fly5dr
Check for the sub directories from the given directory
By using these commands, they can access all the files, pictures, system info, the running processes from the
system. It also has the capability to delete the files in the system and also to download additional payloads and
execute them.
The discovery of malware disguised as a “Lok Sabha Election Results” document from India, underscores the tricky
strategies employed by cyber attackers. As cyber threats continue to evolve, staying informed and proactive is
essential to protect against such deceptive and potentially disruptive attacks. At K7 Labs, we provide robust detection
for these RATs and other day-to-day threats. We recommend using a dependable security solution like “K7 Total
Security” and keeping it up-to-date to safeguard your devices effectively.
