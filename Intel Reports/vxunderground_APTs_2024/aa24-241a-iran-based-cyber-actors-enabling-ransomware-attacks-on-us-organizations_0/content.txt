Iran-based Cyber Actors Enabling 
Ransomware Attacks on US Organizations 
Summary 
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the 
Department of Defense Cyber Crime Center (DC3) are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) to 
warn network defenders that, as of August 2024, a group of Iran-based cyber actors continues to exploit 
U.S. and foreign organizations. This includes organizations across several sectors in the U.S. (including in 
the education, finance, healthcare, and defense sectors as well as local government entities) and other 
countries (including in Israel, Azerbaijan, and the United Arab Emirates). The FBI assesses a significant 
percentage of these threat actors’ operations against US organizations are intended to obtain and develop 
network access to then collaborate with ransomware affiliate actors to deploy ransomware. The FBI further 
assesses these Iran-based cyber actors are associated with the Government of Iran (GOI) and—separate 
from the ransomware activity—conduct computer network exploitation activity in support of the GOI (such 
as intrusions enabling the theft of sensitive technical data against organizations in Israel and Azerbaijan). 
This CSA provides the threat actor’s tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and indicators of 
compromise (IOCs), as well as highlights similar activity from a previous advisory (Iran-Based Threat Actor 
Exploits VPN Vulnerabilities) that the FBI and CISA published on Sept. 15, 2020. The information and 
guidance in this advisory are derived from FBI investigative activity and technical analysis of this group’s 
intrusion activity against U.S. organizations and engagements with numerous entities impacted by this 
malicious activity. 
The FBI recommends all organizations follow guidance provided in the Mitigations section of this advisory 
to defend against the Iranian cyber actors’ activity. 
If organizations believe they have been targeted or compromised by the Iranian cyber actors, the FBI and 
CISA recommend immediately contacting your local FBI field office for assistance and/or reporting the

Threat Actor Details 
Background on Threat Group and Prior Activity 
This advisory outlines activity by a specific group of Iranian cyber actors that has conducted a high volume 
of computer network intrusion attempts against U.S. organizations since 2017 and as recently as August 
2024. Compromised organizations include U.S.-based schools, municipal governments, financial 
institutions, and healthcare facilities. This group is known in the private sector by the names Pioneer 
Kitten, Fox Kitten, UNC757, Parisite, RUBIDIUM, and Lemon Sandstorm.[1][2] The actors also refer to 
themselves by the moniker Br0k3r, and as of 2024, they have been operating under the moniker 
“xplfinder” in their channels. FBI analysis and investigation indicate the group’s activity is consistent with a 
cyber actor with Iranian state-sponsorship. 
The FBI previously observed these actors attempt to monetize their access to victim organizations on cyber 
marketplaces. A significant percentage of the group’s US-focused cyber activity is in furtherance of 
obtaining and maintaining technical access to victim networks to enable future ransomware attacks. The 
actors offer full domain control privileges, as well as domain admin credentials, to numerous networks 
worldwide. More recently, the FBI identified these actors collaborating directly with ransomware affiliates to 
enable encryption operations in exchange for a percentage of the ransom payments. These actors have 
collaborated with the ransomware affiliates NoEscape[3], Ransomhouse[4], and ALPHV (aka BlackCat) 
(#StopRansomware: ALPHV Blackcat). The Iranian cyber actors’ involvement in these ransomware attacks 
goes beyond providing access; they work closely with ransomware affiliates to lock victim networks and 
strategize on approaches to extort victims. The FBI assesses these actors do not disclose their Iran-based 
location to their ransomware affiliate contacts and are intentionally vague as to their nationality and origin. 
Furthermore, the FBI has historically observed this actor conduct hack-and-leak campaigns, such as the 
late 2020 campaign known as Pay2Key.[5],[6] The actors operated a .onion site (reachable through the 
Tor browser) hosted on cloud infrastructure registered to an organization previously compromised by the 
actors. (The actors created the server leveraging their prior access to this victim.) Following the 
compromise and the subsequent unauthorized acquisition of victim data, the actors publicized news of 
their compromise (including on social media), tagging accounts of victim and media organizations, and 
leaking victim data on their .onion site. While this technique has traditionally been used to influence 
victims to pay ransoms, the FBI does not believe the objective of Pay2Key was to obtain ransom payments.

TLP:CLEAR 
Rather, the FBI assesses Pay2Key was an information operation aimed at undermining the security of 
Israel-based cyber infrastructure. 
Attribution Details 
FBI investigation identified that the Iranian cyber actors conduct malicious cyber activity, which FBI 
assessed to be in support of the GOI. The FBI judges this activity to be separate from the previously 
referenced ransomware-enabling activity. This group directs their activity towards countries and 
organizations consistent with Iranian state interests, and typically not of interest to the group’s 
ransomware affiliate contacts, such as U.S. defense sector networks, and those in Israel, Azerbaijan, 
United Arab Emirates. Instead, it is intended to steal sensitive information from these networks, suggesting 
the group maintains an association with the GOI. However, the group’s ransomware activities are likely not 
sanctioned by the GOI, as the actors have expressed concern for government monitoring of cryptocurrency 
movement associated with their malicious activity. 
The group uses the Iranian company name Danesh Novin Sahand (identification number 14007585836), 
likely as a cover IT entity for the group’s malicious cyber activities. 
Technical Details 
Note: This advisory uses the MITRE ATT&CK® Matrix for Enterprise framework, version 15.1. See the 
MITRE ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques section for a table of the threat actors’ activity mapped to MITRE 
ATT&CK tactics and techniques. For assistance with mapping malicious cyber activity to the MITRE ATT&CK 
framework, see CISA and MITRE ATT&CK’s Best Practices for MITRE ATT&CK Mapping and CISA’s Decider 
Tool. 
Overview of Observed Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures 
The Iranian cyber actors’ initial intrusions rely upon exploits of remote external services on internet-facing 
assets to gain initial access to victim networks. As of July 2024, these actors have been observed scanning 
IP addresses hosting Check Point Security Gateways, probing for devices potentially vulnerable to CVE-
2024-24919. As of April 2024, these actors have conducted mass scanning of IP addresses hosting Palo 
Alto Networks PAN-OS and GlobalProtect VPN devices. The actors were likely conducting reconnaissance 
and probing for devices vulnerable to CVE-2024-3400. Historically, this group has exploited organizations 
by leveraging CVE-2019-19781 and CVE-2023-3519 related to Citrix Netscaler, and CVE-2022-1388 
related to BIG-IP F5 devices. 
Reconnaissance, Initial Access, Persistence, and Credential Access 
The actors have been observed using the Shodan search engine to identify and enumerate IP addresses 
that host devices vulnerable to a particular CVE. The actors’ initial access is usually obtained via exploiting 
a public-facing networking device, such as Citrix Netscaler (CVE-2019-19781 and CVE-2023-3519), F5 
BIG-IP (CVE-2022-1388), Pulse Secure/Ivanti VPNs (CVE-2024-21887), and, more recently, PanOS 
firewalls (CVE-2024-3400) [T1596][T1190]. 
Following exploitation of vulnerable devices, the actors use the following techniques: 
 
 
 
FBI | CISA| DC3  
TLP:CLEAR 
Page 4 of 13  |  Product ID: AA24-241A 
TLP:CLEAR 
 
Capture login credentials using webshells on compromised Netscaler devices and append to file 
named netscaler.1 in the same directory as the webshell [T1505.003][T1056]. 
 
Create the directory /var/vpn/themes/imgs/ on Citrix Netscaler devices to deploy a webshell 
[T1505.003]. Malicious files deployed to this directory include: 
o netscaler.1 
o netscaler.php 
o ctxHeaderLogon.php 
 
Specifically related to Netscaler, place additional webshells on compromised devices immediately 
after system owners patch the exploited vulnerability [T1505.003]. The following file locations and 
filenames have been observed on devices: 
o /netscaler/logon/LogonPoint/uiareas/ui_style.php 
o /netscaler/logon/sanpdebug.php  
 
Create the directory /xui/common/images/ on targeted IP addresses [T1133]. 
 
Create accounts on victim networks; observed names include “sqladmin$,” “adfsservice,” 
“IIS_Admin,” “iis-admin,” and “John McCain” [T1136.001]. 
 
Request exemptions to the zero-trust application and security policies for tools they intend to 
deploy on a victim network [T1098]. 
 
Create malicious scheduled task SpaceAgentTaskMgrSHR in Windows/Spaceport/ task folder. 
This task uses a DLL side-loading technique against the signed Microsoft SysInternals executable 
contig.exe, which may be renamed to dllhost.ext, to load a payload from version.dll. This 
file has been observed being executed from the Windows Downloads directory [T1053].  
 
Place a malicious backdoor version.dll in C:\Windows\ADFS\ directory [T1505.003]. 
 
Use a scheduled task to load malware through installed backdoors [T1053]. 
 
Deployment of Meshcentral to connect with compromised servers for remote access [T1219]. 
 
For persistence and as detection and mitigation occurs, the actors create a daily Windows service 
task with random eight characters and attempt execution of a similarly named DLL contained in the 
C:\Windows\system32\drivers\ directory. For example, a service named “test” was observed 
attempting to load a file located at C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\test.sys [T1505]. 
Execution, Privilege Escalation, and Defense Evasion 
 
Repurpose compromised credentials from exploiting networking devices, such as Citrix Netscaler, 
to log into other applications (i.e., Citrix XenDesktop) [T1078.003]. 
 
Repurpose administrative credentials of network administrators to log into domain controllers and 
other infrastructure on victim networks [T1078.002]. 
 
Use administrator credentials to disable antivirus and security software, and lower PowerShell 
policies to a less secure level [T1562.001][T1562.010]. 
 
Attempt to enter security exemption tickets to the network security device or contractor to get the 
actor’s tools allowlisted [T1562.001]. 
 
 
 
FBI | CISA| DC3  
TLP:CLEAR 
Page 5 of 13  |  Product ID: AA24-241A 
TLP:CLEAR 
 
Use a compromised administrator account to initiate a remote desktop session to another server 
on the network. In one instance, the FBI observed this technique being used to attempt to start 
Microsoft Windows PowerShell Integrated Scripted Environment (ISE) to run the command “Invoke-
WebRequest” with a URI including files.catbox[.]moe. Catbox is a free, online file hosting site 
the actors use as a repository/hosting mechanism [T1059.001]. 
Discovery 
 
Export system registry hives and network firewall configurations on compromised servers [T1012]. 
 
Exfiltrate account usernames from the victim domain controller, as well as access configuration 
files and logs—presumably to gather network and user account information for use in further 
exploitation efforts [T1482]. 
Command and Control 
 
Install “AnyDesk” remote access program as a backup access method [T1219]. 
 
Enable servers to use Windows PowerShell Web Access [T1059.001]. 
 
Use the open source tunneling tool Ligolo (ligolo/ligolo-ng) [T1572]. 
 
Use NGROK (ngrok[.]io) deployment to create outbound connections to a random subdomain 
[T1572]. 
Exfiltration and Impact 
After infiltrating victim networks, the actors collaborate with ransomware affiliates (including NoEscape, 
Ransomhouse, and ALPHV [aka BlackCat]) in exchange for a percentage of the ransom payments by 
providing affiliates with access to victim networks, locking victim networks, and strategizing to extort 
victims [T1657]. The actors also conduct what is assessed to be separate set of malicious activity—stealing 
sensitive data from victims [TA0010], likely in support of the GOI.

Indicators of Compromise 
IP Address and Domain Identifiers 
Disclaimer: The IP addresses and domains listed in Table 10 were observed in use by the actors in the 
specified timeframes in 2024. The authoring agencies recommend organizations investigate or vet these 
IP addresses prior to taking action, such as blocking. 
Comment: In addition to the infrastructure provided in the table below, the FBI and CISA warn that these 
actors are known to leverage information obtained through intrusions into cloud-computing resources 
associated with victim organizations. The actors have used this cloud infrastructure to conduct further 
cyber operations targeting other organizations. The FBI observed use of this tradecraft against U.S. 
academic and defense sectors, but it could theoretically be used against any organization. The FBI and 
CISA warn that if these actors compromised your organization, they may be leveraging your cloud services 
accounts to conduct malicious cyber activity and target other victims. The FBI has observed instances of 
the actors using compromised cloud service accounts to transmit data stolen from other compromised 
organizations.

Mitigations 
The FBI and CISA recommend all organizations implement the mitigations listed below to improve their 
cybersecurity posture based on the Iranian cyber group’s activity. The FBI judges the group’s targeting is 
primarily based on the identification of devices vulnerable to CVEs named in this notification (see Technical 
Details section for a list of CVEs). As such, any U.S. organization deploying software with these 
vulnerabilities may be targeted for further exploitation and should follow this guidance to defend against 
exploitation by this group. 
These mitigations align with the Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs) developed by CISA 
and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The CPGs provide a minimum set of 
practices and protections that CISA and NIST recommend all organizations implement. CISA and NIST 
based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common 
and impactful threats, tactics, techniques, and procedures. Visit CISA’s Cross-Sector Cybersecurity 
Performance Goals for more information on the CPGs, including additional recommended baseline 
protections. 
The FBI and CISA recommend all organizations implement the following mitigations: 
 
Review available logs for IP addresses in Table 10 for indications of traffic with your organization’s 
network in the provided timeframes [CPG 3.A]. The indicators in Table 11 should also be reviewed 
to identify historical activity or incidents which may have previously been identified by your 
organization. 
 
Apply patches and/or mitigations for CVE-2024-3400, CVE-2022-1388, CVE-2019-19781, and 
CVE-2023-3519 [CPG 1.E]. 
o Be advised, patching for the above referenced CVEs may be insufficient to mitigate malicious 
activity if your network has already been compromised by these actors while the network device 
was vulnerable. Additional investigation into the use of stolen credentials (e.g., via the webshell 
on Netscaler devices) is strongly encouraged to identify threat actor attempts to establish 
footholds on other parts of the network [CPG 3.A]. 
 
 
 
FBI | CISA| DC3  
TLP:CLEAR 
Page 11 of 13  |  Product ID: AA24-241A 
TLP:CLEAR 
 
Check your systems for the unique identifiers and TTPs used by the actors when operating on 
compromised networks, including creation of specific usernames, use of NGROK and Ligolo, and 
deployment of webshells in specific directories [CPG 3.A]. 
 
Check your systems for outbound web requests to files.catbox[.]moe and ***.ngrok[.]io 
[CPG 3.A]. 
Validate Security Controls 
In addition to applying mitigations, the FBI and CISA recommend exercising, testing, and validating your 
organization's security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK for Enterprise 
framework in this advisory. The authoring agencies recommend testing your existing security controls 
inventory to assess how they perform against the ATT&CK techniques described in this advisory. 
To get started: 
1. Select an ATT&CK technique described in this advisory (see Table 2 to Table 10). 
2. Align your security technologies against the technique. 
3. Test your technologies against the technique. 
4. Analyze your detection and prevention technologies’ performance. 
5. Repeat the process for all security technologies to obtain a set of comprehensive performance 
data. 
6. Tune your security program, including people, processes, and technologies, based on the data 
generated by this process.

ransom note, communications with threat actors, Bitcoin wallet information, decryptor files, and/or a 
benign sample of an encrypted file. 
Additional details of interest include a targeted company point of contact, status and scope of infection, 
estimated loss, operational impact, transaction IDs, date of infection, date detected, initial attack vector, 
and host- and network-based indicators. 
The FBI and CISA do not encourage paying ransom as payment does not guarantee victim files will be 
recovered. Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, 
encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. 
Regardless of whether you or your organization have decided to pay the ransom, the FBI and CISA urge you 
to promptly report ransomware incidents to the FBI’s Internet Crime Complain Center (IC3), your local FBI 
Field Office, or CISA via the agency’s Incident Reporting Form or its 24/7 Operations Center 
(report@cisa.gov), or by calling 1-844-Say-CISA (1-844-729-2472).
