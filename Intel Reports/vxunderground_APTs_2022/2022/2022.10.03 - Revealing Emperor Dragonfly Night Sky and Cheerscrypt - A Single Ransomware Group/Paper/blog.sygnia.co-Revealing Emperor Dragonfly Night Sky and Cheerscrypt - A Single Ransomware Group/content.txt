Revealing Emperor Dragonfly: Night Sky and Cheerscrypt - A Single
Ransomware Group
Key Takeaways
Sygnia recently investigated a Cheerscrypt ransomware attack which utilized Night Sky ransomware TTPs. Further
analysis       revealed that Cheerscrypt and Night Sky are both rebrands of the same threat group, dubbed ‘Emperor
Dragonfly’ by Sygnia.
‘Emperor Dragonfly’ (A.K.A. DEV-0401 / BRONZE STARLIGHT) deployed open-source tools that were written by
Chinese developers for Chinese users. This reinforces claims that the ‘Emperor Dragonfly’ ransomware operators are
based in China.
Contrary to publicly available information, Cheerscrypt ransomware makes use of payloads that target both Windows
and ESXi environments.

Introduction
Sygnia recently investigated an incident involving Cheerscrypt ransomware. As the investigation progressed, it
became clear that the threat actors had successfully maintained their presence inside the compromised network for
several months. During the investigation, our incident response team made a significant discovery: the Tactics,
Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) that were used in this attack strongly resemble those used by another
ransomware group – Night Sky.
The publicly-available information on Cheerscrypt is sparse and focuses on the final payload – the ransomware itself
– and the subsequent encryption of ESXi servers. However, in this incident, Windows servers were also encrypted by
Cheerscrypt’s ransomware encryptor.
Sygnia decided to investigate the threat actors behind this attack, in an attempt to attribute the group to a known
actor. Although Night Sky was previously identified as being associated with another threat group, Cheerscrypt was
unknown. The only clue to their identity was that the threat actors behind Cheerscrypt present themselves as pro-
Ukrainian, indicated by the phrase "Слава Україні!" ("Glory to Ukraine!") and the Ukrainian flag that can be found on
their dark web leak site.

Finding the Link: Night Sky and Cheerscrypt
The attack kill-chain which Sygnia investigated can be broken down into four phases:
Initial access
In January 2022, a VMware Horizon server was compromised by threat actors leveraging the Log4Shell vulnerability
(CVE-2021-4428). Shortly after, PowerShell was used to execute reconnaissance commands and communicate with
a Command and Control (C&C) server. The TTPs and the specific IOCs of this stage match the published information
about Night Sky ransomware.
Establishing foothold within the network
After the successful compromise, PowerShell was used to download three files, which consisted of a signed
legitimate executable, a DLL, and an encrypted file. Next, the legitimate executable was abused to side-load a
weaponized DLL, which loaded and decrypted a Cobalt Strike Beacon.
This method of Cobalt Strike deployment is a known TTP of the Night Sky operators, and the Beacon was
downloaded from a known Night Sky C&C server. However, what Sygnia discovered next was surprising: in parallel
to the Beacon deployment, three tools written in Go were also deployed. These binaries were compiled from open-
source projects, created by Chinese-speaking developers, with documentation in English and Chinese. The binaries
were identified as:
1. A forked version of a keylogger that supports uploading the key-stroke log to Alibaba Cloud Object Storage
Service (Aliyun OSS).
2. A customized version of ‘IOX’ – a port-forwarding and proxy tool. Based on its documentation, IOX can work as
a simple ShadowSocks (an open-source encryption protocol used in China to circumvent internet censorship,
tunneling under the Great Firewall), a fact which demonstrates that the target audience is Chinese.
3. A customized version of ‘NPS’ – a tunneling tool that was deployed alongside IOX. The combination of the tools
enabled the threat actors to create multiple connections through a single tunnel.
The threat actors utilized the same compromised user account to deploy both the Cobalt Strike Beacons and the Go
binaries. This user account was also used to create a system service which functioned as the Go tools persistence
mechanism.
Lateral movement
The threat actors used the Impacket open-source tool to move laterally and perform reconnaissance activities within
the network by executing code remotely. This was achieved by utilizing two of Impacket’s Python modules:
‘SMBExec.py’ and ‘WMIExec.py’.

SMBExec was also used to check whether some of the Cobalt Strike Beacons were still running on compromised
systems.
In the weeks following the initial infiltration, additional Beacons were deployed inside the victim organization’s
systems in the same way (using staging folders and executables previously attributed to Night Sky), communicating
with a new C&C server – one which was not previously attributed to Night Sky ransomware activity.
Data exfiltration and ransomware execution
In the final stages of the attack, the threat actors used the Rclone open-source command-line tool to exfiltrate
sensitive information to Mega, a cloud storage service.
Shortly after, the threat actors delivered the final payload: Cheerscrypt ransomware. Although most publications
describe Cheerscrypt as a Linux-based ransomware family that targets ESXi servers, in the case Sygnia investigated,
both Windows and ESXi machines were encrypted.

Enter the Dragon: Emperor Dragonfly Ransomware Group
The fact that Night Sky IOCs were identified, but Cheerscrypt ransomware was deployed, prompted Sygnia’s Incident
Response team to delve deeper into Cheerscrypt’s origins. It became clear that Cheerscrypt, like Night Sky, is
another ransomware family developed by Emperor Dragonfly.
Emperor Dragonfly – also known as DEV-0401, and BRONZE STARLIGHT – is a Chinese ransomware group that
started operating in mid-2021. Unlike other ransomware groups, Emperor Dragonfly does not operate in an affiliate
model and refrain from purchasing initial access from other threat actors. Instead, they manage all stages of the
attack lifecycle on their own. The group often rebrand their ransomware payloads, which helps them stay under the
radar and avoid sanctions – as they have the appearance of being several, smaller ransomware groups.
In the world of ransomware affiliates and leaked ransomware source code, it is difficult to connect two ransomware
strains with one threat actor. However, the following points represent the cumulative evidence which illustrates the
correlations between Night Sky and Cheerscrypt when compared with Emperor Dragonfly:
1. The observed TTPs are known characteristics of Emperor Dragonfly attacks. These TTPs include the initial
access vector, lateral movement technique, and the unique Cobalt Strike Beacon deployment, using DLL side-
loading and an encrypted Beacon in a separate file. Interestingly, the initial access was part of a wider
exploitation of Log4Shell that was attributed to Emperor Dragonfly, and occurred during the same time frame.

2. Emperor Dragonfly routinely change their ransomware payloads. In the past year, the group used several
ransomware families, including LockFile, AtomSilo, Rook, Night Sky and Pandora. The encryptors of these
ransomware families share code similarities, as they were all created from the leaked source code of Babuk
ransomware. Trend Micro’s analysis of the Cheerscrypt ransomware encryptor revealed that it was also created
from Babuk, indicating a possible link between Night Sky and Cheerscrypt.

4/7
3. Emperor Dragonfly is described by Microsoft as a ‘lone wolf’. Unlike other ransomware groups, they don’t work
in an affiliate model (they don’t offer their ransomware in a ‘ransomware-as-a-service’ model), and they don’t
purchase access from initial access brokers. This supports the assumption that a breach started by Emperor
Dragonfly (with Night Sky TTPs) will probably be completed by Emperor Dragonfly (using a Cheerscrypt
ransomware payload), and it is unlikely that this group sold or transferred this access to another group.

4. Emperor Dragonfly is a China-based ransomware operator, making it a rarity in today’s threat landscape.
During Sygnia’s investigation, we discovered that in parallel to the Cobalt Strike Beacon deployment, three Go
binaries were also deployed (see above). These Go tools are not commonly used by ransomware operators,
and their GitHub popularity rank is relatively low. Emperor Dragonfly used the tools throughout the entire
compromise: they were deployed during early stages and were still running as a persistence mechanism after
the ransomware deployment. This is another indication that a single threat actor conducted the entire operation.

 
The Hunt for Emperor Dragonfly
The following hunting ideas will help you search the organizational network for traces of Emperor Dragonfly.
Search for binaries, scripts, and executions from suspicious folders. In the case of Emperor Dragonfly’s
attack, the same folders were repeatedly used for staging tools throughout the operation. ‘.EXE’, ‘.DLL’, ‘.INI’,
‘.DAT’ and more files were dropped and executed from ‘C:\Windows\Help\*’, ‘C:\Windows\Debug\*’ and
‘C:\Users\Public\*’ folders.

Search for evidence of SMBExec executions. For instance, a service called ‘BTOBTO’ was created on
compromised machines with indicative command lines. The ‘BTOBTO’ service name is the default service
name that is being used in SMBExec code, for remote code execution. The image command line had a specific
format: ‘%COMSPEC%’ /Q /c <COMMAND_TO_EXECUTE> ^> \\127.0.0.1\C$\__output 2^>^&1 >
%TEMP%\execute.bat & %COMSPEC% /Q /c %TEMP%\execute.bat & del %TEMP%\execute.bat’.

Search for evidence of WMIExec executions. Files under ‘ADMIN$’ with the epoch timestamp of the tool’s
execution are created on the target machine on which the command was executed. In addition, ‘cmd.exe’ is
spawned from the WMI provider process (‘WmiPrvSE.exe’). The cmd.exe command line appears to be in a
specific format, containing the string ‘\\0.0.1\ADMIN$\’ as the destination folder for the execution output file.

Monitor users' authentications, and activity from unusual sources. Throughout their operation, the threat
actors leveraged compromised user accounts to perform lateral movement between servers. This kind of
activity might be flagged as suspicious, as users generally perform authentication from endpoints, and not from
servers.

Defending against Emperor Dragonfly
The following measures will help you defend against Emperor Dragonfly TTPs (as well as similar threats):
Identify and patch critical vulnerabilities. If you are running VMware Horizon, follow VMware advisory to ensure
the currently installed version is patched against the Log4Shell vulnerability, which was exploited as the initial
infiltration vector. More generally, it is essential to conduct frequent vulnerability scans and swiftly mitigate
discovered issues, with a special focus on internet-facing systems. External Attack Surface Management
(EASM) tools, or even more traditional vulnerability or port scanners, can be leveraged to identify publicly
exposed vulnerable interfaces.

5/7
Limit outbound internet access from servers. Denying egress traffic by default would’ve blocked the ability
to communicate with the threat actor’s C&C server, as well as with the cloud storage services (Alibaba, Mega),
thus mitigating persistence and data exfiltration activities. Allow outbound connectivity to only specific
destinations (FQDN or IP addresses), on a strict need-to-have basis.

Protect the virtualization platform. Ransomware attacks targeting virtualization platforms is a growing trend, due
to their simplicity and efficiency from the perspective of threat actors. Among the most prominent security
controls for VMware against this threat are allowing traffic towards vCenter and ESXi hosts only from protected
bastion hosts, enabling strict lockdown mode, and restricting unsigned scripts by enabling the
‘execInstalledOnly’ flag. In addition, ensure virtual machines are securely backed-up; for example, if VM
backups are made using snapshots which are stored on the same folder as the machine, threat actors may
encrypt backups as well.

Limit lateral movement through the network. Threat actors often leverage common management ports to
move laterally between hosts, and Emperor Dragonfly is no different, with the use of SMBExec and WMIExec.
Restricting traffic over such ports (namely SMB 445, RPC 135, WinRM 5985-5986, RDP 3389, SSH 22), and
allowing traffic only from designated specific hosts, may be cumbersome in complex networks, but brings
immense value. This may be achieved by host-based firewalls, proper network segmentation, or modern
microsegmention technologies.

Protect privileged accounts. Minimize the risk of privilege escalation by hardening the Active Directory
environment, applying the principle of least privilege and AD administrative tier model, employing robust
credential and password hygiene practices, and considering the implementation of Privileged Identity and
Access solutions. While these security measures are by no means unique to Emperor Dragonfly TTPs,
compromising privileged accounts and using them to move laterally and execute the ransomware is a practice
noticed in the described incidents as well.
