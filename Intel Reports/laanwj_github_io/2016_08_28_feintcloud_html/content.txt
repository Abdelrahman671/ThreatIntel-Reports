  <h1>FEINTCLOUD</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>In the Equation Group dump many of the implants can announce themselves with
beacons, especially the BIOS implants. These beacons are disguised as normal
network packets, likely directed at fake hosts, to be intercepted by
intermediate infrastructure. The list in BLATSTING <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">beacon</code> listening post
module gives a possible list of disguises:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>FEINTCLOUD DNSDIRECT
FEINTCLOUD HTTP1
FEINTCLOUD NTP1
FEINTCLOUD PING-2
FEINTCLOUD PING_1_L
FEINTCLOUD TCPSYN
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Beaconing would be silly when a host is implanted though remote exploitation
as the target IP and the topology of their network is obviously known.</p>

<p>However I suppose that these are used when a host is implanted e.g. along the
supply chain and it is unknown where it is going to end up on the network.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to look into this further to get an handle on which
networks and hosts are infected. The above kinds of packets are typical ways
to hide within a crowd on the internet, but periodical announcements with
certain properties may stick out.</p>

<p>The “FEINTCLOUD” name doesn’t seem to turn up anything on Google. Has anyone
encountered this project in one of the Snowden documents? It vaguely rings
familiar.</p>

<p><i>Edit 2016-09-04</i>: it looks like BBANJO (BANANABANJO?) in the BANANAGLEE framework is
also a beaconing module, and various versions are available in the dump
(<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Firewall/BANANAGLEE/*/Install/LP/Modules/PIX/BBANJO-*</code>). May be interesting
to reverse-engineer to get more insight. Could be fairly straightforward as
local symbols such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">obfuscate_payload1</code> are still present.</p>

<p><small>Note: I’m continuing work on reverse-engineering the BLATSTING rootkit
and reporting <a href="https://gist.github.com/laanwj/9e5e404266a8956beabde522f97c421b">here</a>.</small></p>
