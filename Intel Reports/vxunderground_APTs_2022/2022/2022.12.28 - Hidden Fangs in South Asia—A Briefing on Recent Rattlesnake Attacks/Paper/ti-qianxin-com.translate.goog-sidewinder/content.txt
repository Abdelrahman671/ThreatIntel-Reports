Hidden Fangs in South Asia—A ​​Briefing on Recent Rattlesnake
Attacks
background
Sidewinder, also known as APT-C-17, Qi Anxin's internal tracking number is APT-Q-39. Its attack activities can be
traced back as early as 2012. The organization mainly launched attacks against countries such as Pakistan, China,
Afghanistan, Nepal, and Bangladesh, aiming to steal confidential information from government diplomatic agencies,
defense and military departments, and higher education institutions. Activities have a strong political background. The
organization is capable of attacking both Windows and Android platforms.
The group primarily utilizes email spear-phishing, exploit documents, and DLL sideloading techniques to evade
detection and deliver targeted implants. Commonly used attack bait types are: office documents and Ink. Among
them, after Ink is executed, Powershell will release the real file and download and execute the hta script to load
subsequent malicious files; Office documents are the group's favorite attack bait, which are executed by exploiting
known vulnerabilities (such as the CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability) follow-up activities. The organization will also use
the method of white and black to load malicious files [1] .

overview
The Rattlesnake Organization has always been our focus. Recently, the Red Raindrop team of Qi Anxin Threat
Intelligence Center captured multiple attack samples of the organization in daily threat hunting. This type of sample
uses Pakistan-related schools or the army as bait to carry out harpoon attacks, and its attack techniques and tactics
(TTP) use the DotNetToJScript tool to generate JS code to load .net programs. In the recent attack activities, we
summarized the characteristics of the attack methods of the Sidewinder organization:
(1) Make good use of social engineering and use more appropriate bait, even the bait comes from real documents;
(2) Multi-stage download and obfuscation of subsequent loads;
(3) Use a lightweight remote Shell backdoor, and continue to use related C2 even after being exposed.
After discovering the attack, the Red Raindrop team immediately alerted the security community [2] , but this seems
to have alerted the operators of the Rattlesnake organization, and shut down C2 immediately.

Using relevant documents of the Pakistan Navy as bait, the content of the bait is as follows:
There is no macro code in the decoy sample, and remote template injection is used to pull subsequent loads for
execution, reducing the possibility of being killed by anti-software in the early stage. Its remote template injection
address is https://pnwc.bol-north.com/5808/1/3686/2/0/0/0/m/files-a2e589d2/file.rtf, it can be seen that its domain
name is disguised as pnwc Naval War College, Pakistan, agreed with the content of the bait.

sample analysis
remote template file
The remote template file is an RTF file, which uses the CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability to execute Shellcode, and
releases the subsequent payload 1.a file to the %temp% directory through the RTF file feature.
5/16
After the vulnerability is executed, execute a ROP chain to jump to the Shellcode location, and the exploit will trigger
two pieces of shellcode. The main function of the first shellcode is to obtain the specified memory block by calling the
Globallock function, then calculate the starting position of the second shellcode, and jump to the second shellcode for
execution.
The shellcode contains a large number of wasteful instructions, which indicates that Sidewinder is gradually
improving its shellcode to slow down the analysis speed of analysts. The main function of Shellcode is to load
mshtml.dll, call the API RunHTMLApplication function in it, and execute XOR-decrypted commands.

(\\"Scripting\.FileSystemObject\\"\);eval\(ab\.OpenTextFile\(ab\.GetSpecialFolder\

The basic information of the released 1.a file is as follows.

file type
JavaScript
1.a file should be generated by modifying the open source tool DotNetToJScript. The string is obfuscated by multi-
layer nested conversion functions, and the embedded PE file is divided into two parts. The former part is obfuscated,
and the latter part is used BASE64 for encoding.
The script first decrypts the App.dll, and loads the Work function in the DLL reflectively, and passes 4 parameters to
the Work function. The parameter 1 is the URL for downloading file.hta, and the parameter 2 is the uploaded antivirus
information. Since the decoy file has been displayed , here parameter 3 and parameter 4 are empty, unlike the
previously encrypted decoy document content and decoy document name.
7/16

App.dll
App.dll is actually a dll written in .net, and it has also been obfuscated, but the obfuscator did not obfuscate the key
code too much, and the core code is still readable.
Its main function is to download the follow-up payload from the URL parameter. The relevant method to initiate a
request to C2 is Program.osteologistfearfullestprofessionallystreptolysinconsumerisms. The content downloaded from
the URL corresponding to parameter 1 of the Work method will be decrypted through simple xor, and then loaded and
executed.
8/16
Regrettably, C2 was closed shortly after we disclosed it for the first time, and we failed to download the follow-up
paylaod. In the follow-up, as we continued to pay attention, the organization still uploaded attack files similar to TTP,
such as Pakistani Naval procurement information is used as bait to attack.
9/16
The domain name of the link injected into the remote template is also faked to be related to the decoy content.
10/16
Some subsequent remote template files are basically consistent with the above. Based on this, we analyze the recent
attack activities organized by the Sidewinder organization. The remote template file information is as follows:

Traceability association
In addition, in the follow-up clue sorting, we also found another attack component of the Sidewinder organization. As
of the completion of this manuscript, the C2 that delivered the attack component is still active. Since this component
has been analyzed by a friend, we only make a brief disclosure and do not analyze it in detail.
The details of the attack components are as follows:

The actual function of this attack component is a downloader, which also downloads and decrypts the JS code
generated by the DotNetToJScript tool and executes it. The difference is that in the win10 system, Microsoft
introduced AMSI and added the script features based on DotNetToJScript to the detection sequence, so if you do not
bypass the processing and directly run the script generated by DotNetToJScript, it will be directly intercepted by the
system . So the Sidewinder organization registered the DLL notification callback in the attack component and hooked
the "AmsiScanBuffer" function to bypass detection.
The file downloaded from C2 is an encrypted JS file, which is executed in memory after XOR decryption.
12/16
The JS code also reflectively loads LiveConsoleModule.dll in the memory. This dll is actually a remote Shell RAT,
which listens to the local TCP port 12323 and uses cmd to execute remote Shell commands.
13/16

Summarize
For a long time, the Rattlesnake organization has been good at using social engineering to attack, especially using
special file stealers to steal important information in the victim's network environment. In addition to causing leaks, the
stolen information can also be used to make new bait, and in its attack activities, the fake C2 domain name also
appears, which is very confusing.
Qi'anxin Red Raindrop team hereby reminds all users, do not open links from unknown sources shared by social
media, do not click on and execute email attachments from unknown sources, do not run unknown files with
exaggerated titles, and do not install apps from informal sources. Back up important files in time and update and
install patches.
If you need to run or install applications from unknown sources, you can first identify them through the Qi Anxin threat
intelligence file in-depth analysis platform (https://sandbox.ti.qianxin.com/sandbox/page). At present, it supports in-
depth analysis of files in various formats including Windows and Android platforms.

At present, the full line of products based on the threat intelligence data of Qi Anxin Threat Intelligence Center,
including Qi Anxin Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP), Tianqing, Tianyan Advanced Threat Detection System, Qi Anxin
Tiangou Vulnerability Attack Protection System, Qi Anxin NGSOC, Qi Anxin Situation Perception, etc., have
supported the precise detection of such attacks.
