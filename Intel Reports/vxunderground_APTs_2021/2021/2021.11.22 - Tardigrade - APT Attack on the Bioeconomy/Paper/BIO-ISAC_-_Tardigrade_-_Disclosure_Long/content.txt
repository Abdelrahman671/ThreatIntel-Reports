• First Variant: SmokeLoader
• Suspected Second Variant: Dofoil 
Attack delivery:
• USB, Files, Network autonomously
• Primary: Phishing
Goal:
• The main role of this malware is still to download, manipulate files, send main.dll library if possible, deploy other 
modules and remain hidden.
• Espionage, tunnel creation, carry a bigger payload.
• Compatible with other APT made payloads so far: Conti, Ryuk, Cobalt Strike

Metamorphic
• While many malware systems are polymorphic, this system seems to be able to recompile the loader from 
memory without leaving a consistent signature.
• Recompiling occurs after a network connection in the wild that could be a call to a command and control (CnC) 
server to download and execute the complier
• Allows the system to change portions/all the functions based on CnC like a normal loader system but with a level 
of autonomy that is unexpected

Autonomy
• Previous SmokeLoader versions were externally directed, dependent on CnC infrastructure
• This “Tardigrade” version is far more autonomous, able to decide on lateral movement based on internal logic
• Significant level of autonomous decision-making ability, possibly on random wait times.
• The ability to selectively identify files for modification.
Privilege Escalation
• Uses impersonate client technique to gain Admin control
Connectivity
• Replaces Main.dll and attempts to export original to varying IPs that do not correlate with a specific CnC
• Traffic is encrypted and uses a diversity of methods (no more to share at this time)
• One method of lateral spread uses network shares and creates folders in CnC connected servers with random names

ImpersonateNamedPipeClient
• This function allows the server end of a named pipe to impersonate 
the client end. 
• When this function is called, the named-pipe file system changes 
the thread of the calling process to start impersonating the security 
context of the last message read from the pipe. 
• Only the server end of the pipe can call this function. The server 
can call the RevertToSelf function when the impersonation is 
complete
Initial Actions
Embargoed until Nov 22nd 12 (Noon) US ET
WaitNamedPipeA
• Waits until either a time-out interval elapses or an instance of the 
specified named pipe is available for connection (that is, the pipe's 
server process has a pending ConnectNamedPipe operation on the 
pipe)
• Rax identifies that the malware is writing to a specific register
Behavior in timing
Embargoed until Nov 22nd 12 (Noon) US ET
• Retrieves a registered handle to the specified event log. The 
Universal Naming Convention (UNC) name of the remote server on 
which this operation is to be performed. 
• The name of the event source whose handle is to be retrieved. The 
source name must be a subkey of a log under the Eventlog registry 
key. 
• Note that the Security log is for system use only.
Remote Server Behavior

Flush File Function
FlushFileBuffers
• This function clears the buffers for the specified file and causes all 
buffered data to be written to the file
Embargoed until Nov 22nd 12 (Noon) US ET
ReplaceFile
• Replaces one file with another file, with the option of creating a backup copy 
of the original file. The replacement file assumes the name of the replaced 
file and its identity. 
• This function combines several steps within a single function. An application 
can call ReplaceFile instead of calling separate functions to save the data to a 
new file, rename the original file using a temporary name, rename the new 
file to have the same name as the original file, and delete the original file. 
• Another advantage is that ReplaceFile not only copies the new file data, but 
also preserves the following attributes of the original file:
•
Creation time
•
Short file name
•
Object identifier
•
DACLs
•
Security resource attributes
•
Encryption
•
Compression
•
Named streams not already in the replacement file
• For example, if the replacement file is encrypted, but the replaced file is not 
encrypted, the resulting file is not encrypted.
Obfuscation and File Attribute Spoofing
Embargoed until Nov 22nd 12 (Noon) US ET
RegFlushKey
• Calling RegFlushKey is an expensive operation that significantly 
affects system-wide performance as it consumes disk bandwidth 
and blocks modifications to all keys by all processes in the registry 
hive that is being flushed until the flush operation completes.
• RegFlushKey should only be called explicitly when an application 
must guarantee that registry changes are persisted to disk 
immediately after modification. 
• All modifications made to keys are visible to other processes 
without the need to flush them to disk

Recommendations
Embargoed until Nov 22nd 12 (Noon) US ET
1. Review your biomanufacturing network segmentation
•
Run tests to verify proper segmentation between corporate, guest and 
operational networks
•
Most facilities use remote logins with shared passwords to operate key 
instrumentation. Enforcing segmentation is essential.
2. Work with biologists and automation specialists to create a “crown 
jewels” analysis for your company
•
Ask: “if this machine was inoperable overnight, what would be the impact?”
•
Ask: “how long would it take to re-certify (GxP) this instrument?”
3. Test and perform offline backups of key biological infrastructure
•
Ladder logic for biomanufacturing instrumentation
•
SCADA and Historian configurations
•
Batch record system
4. Inquire about lead times for key bio-infrastructure components
•
Chromatography systems
•
Endotoxin and microbial contamination systems
Recommendations – DO THIS TODAY

Prevention is Key
• Use antivirus with behavioral analysis capabilities
• Phishing is a vector of attack
•
Train biomanufacturing facility staff to look out for targeted attacks
•
Review LinkedIn and other social media posts of employees for vaccine 
manufacturing posts to determine likely targets
Awareness
• The Bioeconomy and Biomanufacturing sectors are under 
concerted, sophisticated attack. You are a target.
• This malware is extremely difficult to detect due to metamorphic 
behavior. Vigilance on key personnel corporate computers is 
important.

Accelerate upgrade paths for key instruments
• Many machines in the sector use outdated operating systems. 
Segment them off aggressively and accelerate upgrade timelines
