Key findings 
In this report are presented: 
• 
The online presence of “all_father”, the user advertising PandorahVNC. 
• 
The capabilities of PandorahVNC and other known threat actors that were observed using it. 
• 
An infrastructure related to PandorahVNC which is advertised as “anonvnc” and is linked with 
the remote tool Mesh Central. 
Introduction  
 
Hidden Virtual Network Computing (HVNC) is a sophisticated form of remote access designed for 
stealthy control over an infected system. Unlike traditional VNC tools, HVNC operates covertly, 
ensuring that the infected user's desktop environment remains unchanged and unsuspecting while the 
attacker manipulates a hidden desktop session.  
HVNC malware is often employed in targeted attacks and is favoured for its ability to bypass traditional 
security measures. It enables attackers to remotely control the compromised machine, perform 
financial transactions, or access sensitive information without being detected by the victim. The use of 
HVNC has been associated with various cybercrime campaigns, particularly those targeting financial 
institutions and enterprises.  
For this analysis, we will delve into the capabilities of PandorahVNC, exploring its infection vectors, 
infrastructure, and the implications of its deployment in the current threat landscape. We will also 
focus on an infrastructure linked with PandorahVNC that is currently being built to advertise a tool 
named “anonvnc”, related to MeshCentral remote session manager. By understanding the 
mechanisms and impact of these malware, cybersecurity professionals can better prepare defences 
and mitigate the risks associated with them.  
On 10 March 2022, Florian Roth (@cyb3rops on X) made a tweet about PandorahVNC, exposing the 
content of one of its websites and asking his audience if this is “malware or legitimate software that 
has the same features and functions as malware?”. An OSINT investigation on PandorahVNC’s operator 
was made by SlashNext on 13 December 2023, but since we did not identify a complete analysis of this 
operator and its tool, we decided to start an investigation on this subject.

I. 
Strategical Intelligence 
1. Attribution 
1.1 Online presence 
PandorahVNC is sold and advertised by user “All_father”, “All Father” or “Allfather” on various 
channels. We identified the presence of this user on the cybercrime forums Exploit, XSS, Hackforum, 
on the messaging application Telegram, on Sellpass, GitHub, and on Vimeo. He also owns various 
websites where users can view the functionalities of his tool “PandorahVNC” and buy it. 
“All_father” joined the forum Exploit on 13 September 2021 and created a thread named “Pandora 
hVNC 2FA Bypass Hidden Desktop/ Outlook/ Foxmail/ Thunderbird Hidden Browsers/ WebGL/ Clone 
Profile/Chrome/ FireFox/” on 19 September 2021, to advertise its malware.  
 
Figure 1 : « All_father » thread on Exploit. 
This thread is used to showcase the capabilities of PandorahVNC, notify users of new updates and add 
contact information and prices for new buyers. The malware is sold for prices going from $499 for 1 
month, $849 for 3 months, $1199 for 6 months and $1899 for 12 months. To contact “All_father”, 
users can visit his official websites “pandorahvnc.sellpass[.]io” or “hvncs[.]com”. Previously, the 
website “hiddenvnc[.]com” was advertised. This domain is of interest, as in the section “AnonVNC” of 
this analysis, it will be used to reveal links between PandorahVNC and a potential new service.

Figure 2: Official websites and Telegram handles advertised by “All_father”. 
On the website hvncs[.]com we see that “All_father” possesses other means of contact, namely the 
email addresses “hiddenvnc[@]gmail[.]com”, “pandorahVNC[@]gmail[.]com” and the jabber 
“allfather[@]jabb3r[.]org”. 
 
Figure 3: Contact information given by the website where users can buy PandorahVNC. 
Users can also contact him privately on Telegram using the handle “@hVNCs” or go to his Telegram 
channel “PandorahVNC”. The channel was created on 18 August 2021, first as a group chat and was 
later converted into a channel. It has 969 members, and the last message was on 8 June 2024 to 
advertise the malware’s latest update.

1.2 Intel gained from Vimeo 
We noticed that “All Father” frequently shared Vimeo videos to showcase the capabilities of its 
malware. We decided to consult all his videos to see if valuable information could be gained from 
them. The main channel of “All Father” on Vimeo was created in August 2021 and has 9 videos. We 
also identified another account named “Pandora” created in June 2023. However, the only video on 
this channel is private. 
 
 
 
Figure 5: Vimeo channels belonging to “All_father”. Source: https://vimeo.com/user148942049. 
We see on one video that he visited a specific URL. The endpoint “/pandora/index.php” will be 
identified later in this analysis as we discovered C2 IP addresses linked with PandorahVNC: 
localhost:1337/pandora/index.php?user=admin123&action=build&ip=185.36.191.24&port=1338&id=

Port 1337 was identified as the default port for listening event when a user of PandorahVNC starts a 
communication.

1.3 Github 
Using the email addresses exposed by AllFather on his website and videos, we were able to discover 
his GitHub account “PandorahVNC” with the help of Epieos. 
 
Figure 10: GitHub account “PandorahVNC” linked with hiddenvnc[@]gmail.com as evidenced by Epieos. 
 
This GitHub account only has one repository that was not modified in the last 3 years, named 
“PhotoCollection”. It contains two .jpg files named “Pandora_by_Daniel_F.Gerhartz” and “psyche” 
showing work of arts related to the myth of Pandora, and a .ps1 file named “rescale.ps1”. This file will 
be the starting point of the section “Infrastructure Analysis”, where we discovered how PandorahVNC 
interacts with its central infrastructure.

2. Threat actors leveraging the tool 
2.1 State-sponsored intrusion sets and hacktivists 
Searching on public literature of other cybersecurity editors, we identified that PandorahVNC was used 
by various threat actors. The Ukrainian government published in 22 April 2024 an article indicating that 
the intrusion set tracked as UAC-0056 used PandorahVNC, combined with other tools such as 
GrimPlant, GraphSteel and RemoteUtilities to target Ukraine’s critical IT infrastructure. UAC-0056 is 
identified by the Ukrainian services as being composed of “Russian hacktivists and cyber spies”. 
According to SentinelOne, this intrusion set is also known as UNC2589 as tracked by Mandiant, and is 
extensively focused on targeting Ukraine and NATO members. Unfortunately, the article does not 
detail how PandorahVNC was used in the kill chain. 
 
2.2 Cybercrime actors 
In a phishing campaign identified by Fortinet on May 2022, a threat actor delivered three different 
malware: PandorahVNC, AveMariaRAT and BitRAT. In this campaign, PandorahVNC was injected in 
RegASM.exe and contacted the domain vncgoga.duckdns[.]org as a C2 on port 1338. It is interesting 
that according to VirusTotal, this domain was contacted by a file named “stub.exe”, that also contacted 
the URL “http://51.254.27.112:1337/skra.jpg“, which is the same network communication we 
identified in the section “2.1 PandorahVNC C2s” of this analysis. 
On Exploit, AllFather showed answers from a variety of clients on his thread, showing that they made 
financial gains using PandorahVNC. What is revealed by these screenshots and messages is that the 
tool is used to log into their victim’s bank accounts and crypto wallets and empty them. One actor also 
showed that he is connected to an internal bank IT account and uses it to create bank accounts. This

highlights the risk posed by this malware that could enable various malicious actions such as espionage, 
financial and account theft, as well as data exfiltration.

Inside the builder of PandorahVNC, users can setup the following options: IP/DNS and port, startup 
folder (%AppData%, %AppData%\Local, %AppData%\Roaming or %AppData%\Local\Temp), sleep 
time on startup, offline keylogging. They can also modify the assembly information of the client file, 
namely the icon, product name, description, company, copyright, trademarks, original filename, 
product version, file version. This is particularly useful for threat actors looking to masquerade their 
malware as a legitimate file for phishing attempts. 
 
Figure 14: Builder options as seen in one of all_father’s video. 
2. Infrastructure Analysis 
2.1 PandorahVNC C2s 
We found that 155 files were referring the .ps1 file found inside PandorahVNC repository named 
“rescaleps1”. This is highly suspicious as the content of the file is simple and the repository is not 
“popular” on GitHub. As indicated by its name and content, this file could be used by the “scale 
resolution” feature of PandorahVNC.

Querying one of these 155 files on VirusTotal, we see that it communicated with the IP address 
51.254.27.112 to the endpoint “/skra.jpg”. Notice that the IP address is contacted on port 1337, as 
seen in the showcasing of PandorahVNC by AllFather on Vimeo (see Intel gained from Vimeo).

This IP address appears to be effectively linked to PandorahVNC, as evidenced by the endpoints 
“/pandora/index.php” 
(that 
was 
seen 
in 
one 
of 
Allfather’s 
video) 
and 
“/pandora/update/PandorahVNC.exe”. As this IP address was also identified by pivoting of a threat 
actor’s PandorahVNC C2 found by Fortinet, it is possible that this is not a specific threat actor C2 but a 
central C2 used by the malware to update its functionalities amongst other things.

Using Censys, we find another IP address that exposes the “AnonVNC – Login” html title on port 443: 
94.131.121[.]91. The IP address is now resolved by the domain validatax[.]com since 25 June 2024, 
which exposes an AnonVNC Login panel while it was previously resolved by the domain 
help.vncapk[.]io in 30 May 2024. What is interesting is that this IP address belongs to AS44477 of Stark 
Industries Solutions Ltd. The fact that the domain name “validatax” is more phishing-ready than 
“vncapk” indicates that the operator may be starting to weaponize his toolset. Moreover, we found 
the golden image “WIN-BS656MOF35Q” on port 3389 of this IP address. This image emerged in May 
2023 and is now shared across 4 335 hosts belonging to some organizations we have previously 
identified as renowned for being complacent with cybercrime.

This is particularly interesting as we found the logo of the website meshcentral[.]com on the website 
sync.hiddenvnc.com.

MeshCentral is a legitimate open-source remote session manager that was leveraged by several 
intrusion sets (sometimes via Tactical remote monitoring & management tool): 
• 
Upon an Emotet infection observed by The DFIR Report that led to Quantum ransomware 
• 
SparkRAT and Sliver C2 campaigns against Korean individuals 
• 
a LilacSquid campaign that used Mesh Agent and QuasarRAT as primary implants to deploy 
customised malware after successfully compromising vulnerable application servers exposed 
to the internet 
• 
an Andariel (Lazarus subgroup) attack campaign 
 
In August 2022, user @malmoeb on X explained how this legitimate tool could be leveraged by 
malicious threat actors. @1ZRR4H also indicated in the case of Tactical RMM that it could be leveraged 
by the ransomware ecosystem operators as a C2. 
These findings could indicate that the operator of PandorahVNC and Anonvnc could be testing 
MeshCentral for their toolkit. 
On the IP address 66.94.109[.]162, we also see that the domain help.vncapk[.]io. communicated with 
several files named “companyagent.exe” and a file named “MeshCentralAssistant.exe”.

3. Technical Analysis of Mesh Agent 
We then decided to analyse one of the Mesh Agent file (named “invoice#251561.exe”) to see how it 
interacts with the “vnc” domains. This file appeared to be more ready to be weaponised in a campaign, 
as contrary to the others it had a name that could be used in a phishing attempt. 
The file is a PE (Portable Executable) 64-bit with a size of 6 MB and described as “MeshCentral 
Background Service Agent”. In the .data section we can identify in cleartext the different switches 
available for Mesh Agent:

Figure 35: Switches mentioned in the .data section of the Mesh Agent file. 
We also identified strings related to WSS connections to the URLs meshcentral[.]com:443/agent.ashx 
and swarm.meshcentral[.]com:443/agent.ashx. WSS is used for WebSocket connections over TLS that 
enables a persistent connection between the client and server, which is especially useful in the context 
of a remote connection using Mesh Agent. 
 
 
Figure 36: Strings related to wss connection to meshcentral domains. 
This file is signed by “Siam Computer (MD Kamrul Hassan)”, but in another Mesh Agent file that 
communicated with the same domains as above using WSS, we found that it was signed by 
“sync.anonvnc.com-96954f” on 11 June 2024.

In fact, it was issued by “MeshCentralRoot-ad3a9c” to “sync.anonvnc.com-96954f”. MeshCentralRoot 
is the default issuer name used by meshcentral[.]com. 
 
Figure 38: The certificate is issued by MeshCentralRoot-ad3a9c. 
Searching for certificates signed by the subject name “sync.anonvnc[.]com” we find 12 files on 
VirusTotal, which correspond more or less to the files seen referring to sync.anonvnc[.]com. These files 
were first seen between the 12 and 13 June 2024, and last seen until 15 June 2024. They were signed 
by “sync.anonvnc.com-96954f” and “sync.anonvnc.com-d7add5”, issued by “MeshCentralRoot-
ad3a9c” and “MeshCentralRoot-6dc5c6”.

Additionally, we found a discriminant certificate issued by “MeshCentralRoot-ad7d56” on port 4433 
of the IP addresses 94.131.121[.]91 and 66.94.109[.]162 (exposing AnonVNC’s login panels):

2. Recommendations 
• 
Block the indicators in the IOC section of this analysis 
Meshcentral 
As far as meshcentral RMM threat hunting is concerned, one could search for: 
• 
 "agent.ashx" in the proxy logs for hunting MeshCentral network connections 
Windows Event ID 7045 corresponding to a new installation of a service in the system (service name: 
Mesh Agent). A sigma rule allows to detects a TacticalRMM service installation. 
Besides, Meshcentral is sometimes embedded in Tactical RMM, which uses Golang written agents and 
that also should be monitored closely. 
We advise to pay close attention to other known Remote Access Software reported in the MITRE Attack 
framework.
