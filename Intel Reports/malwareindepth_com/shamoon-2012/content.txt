            <p>The whole inspiration of this blog began when I saw the above picture. </p><p>For those that don't know, this was ASCII art embedded within a .NET dropper that supposedly dropped a version of Shamoon back in December of 2018. This immediately peaked my interest and I began my reversing of the sample. Initially I was looking for resources around this specific sample but quickly found that Shamoon has a rich history and has been utilized in some very interesting campaigns. So I decided I would start at its beginning and work my way through its history. At this point I have almost 40 samples for the various campaigns and have reverse engineered all of them to various degrees. These samples were relatively unorganized and I needed a way to fix that. I wrote a tool that could categorize the samples based on various traits. The samples broke down into a couple of groups and after looking into a sample from each group, I identified the following campaigns:  </p><ul><li>Shamoon 2012</li><li>Shamoon 2016</li><li>Shamoon 2017</li><li>Shamoon 2018 v1</li><li>Shamoon 2018 v2</li><li>Shamoon 2018 v3</li></ul><p>I will try to make a post describing the capabilities of a sample in each campaign if time permits. So without further ado, lets get into Shamoon 2012. </p><h2 id="research-process">Research Process</h2><p>For this series, I decided to focus on the following goals: </p><ol><li>Educate users on the timeline and history of Shamoon</li><li>Share IOCs and detection mechanisms</li><li>Release tools that can be used to help researchers analyze samples in the future</li></ol><p>With these goals I decided the best plan of attack was to gather as many Shamoon samples that I could find, read all the blog posts/reports that I could find and listen to podcasts about the campaigns. I got my samples from various sources such as <a href="https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/">Hybrid Analysis</a>, <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home">VirusTotal</a>, <a href="https://malware.one/index.php">Malware.one</a>, <a href="https://virusshare.com/">VirusShare</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ytisf/theZoo">TheZoo</a>, and other malware researchers in the field. </p><p>With a decent set I was keen on figuring out a way to programmatically sort the samples into their campaigns. After analyzing the samples I realized each sample over the years had resources that could be used to determine the campaign it originated from. This led to the creation of a script that would group the samples based on the resources that were contained in each sample. </p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://malwareindepth.com/content/images/2019/07/Annotation-2019-07-09-232728.jpg" class="kg-image"><figcaption>All samples organized based on the unique resource names / IDs</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><h2 id="shamoon-2012-overview">Shamoon 2012 Overview</h2><p>The first known target for the Shamoon malware was the oil company Saudi Aramco. For those that don't know Saudi Aramco is the largest petroleum and natural gas company in the world and a lot of Saudi Arabia's economy is centered around this single company. While they are a privately held company, it is estimated that the company is worth between 1-3 trillion dollars. </p><p>Considering their worth and their ties with the Saudi government, they are a prime target for cyber attacks. Especially those that might not have the best relations with Saudi Arabia. </p><p>Ideas of how Shamoon ended up on the Saudi Aramco's systems is unclear currently. Some reports say it was via the <a href="https://www.acunetix.com/vulnerability-scanner/">Acunetix vulnerability scanner</a>, a phishing email or simply even a malicious USB that an employee had inserted into their machine. Speculation is that the threat actor got into the network sometime around April or May of 2012 and spent the next couple of months moving laterally and trying to gain access to a Domain Controller. </p><p>All this effort led up to the events of August 15th 11:08 AM when over 80% of Saudi Aramco's workstations and servers had their drives wiped due to a hard coded detonation date in the Shamoon malware.  Its important to note that this date is not random, some might know that for 2012 the night before was a holiday known as the Night of Power or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laylat_al-Qadr">Lailat al-Qadr</a>. It is regarded as one of Islam's holiest nights of the year. Much of the Islam community shuts down to celebrate the revelation of the Quran. As tradition for Saudi Aramco and most of the country, 50,000 employees stayed home on the 15th to celebrate the holiday and spend time with their families. This of course left the company itself and the workstations in Saudi Arabia at its most vulnerable. </p><p>In addition to having the users drives wiped, the workstations were left with an the first 1024 bytes of an image of a burning American flag. Although most users weren't even able to view this picture as their master boot records had been corrupted in the process. This could be taken as a political statement or a misdirection. </p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://malwareindepth.com/content/images/2019/07/shamoon.jpg" class="kg-image"><figcaption>Complete image of snippet left on the workstations</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>Nearly 11 hours after the detonation timestamp of Shamoon, a <a href="https://www.pastebin.com/hqAgaQRj">post </a>was shared on popular paste site pastebin.com, which stated the following.</p><blockquote>We, behalf of an anti-oppression hacker group that have been fed up of crimes and atrocities taking place in various countries around the world, especially in the neighboring countries such as Syria, Bahrain, Yemen, Lebanon, Egypt and ..., and also of dual approach of the world community to these nations, want to hit the main supporters of these disasters by this action.</blockquote><blockquote>One of the main supporters of this disasters is Al-Saud corrupt regime that<br>sponsors such oppressive measures by using Muslims oil resources. Al-Saud is a partner in committing these crimes. It's hands are infected with the blood of innocent children and people.</blockquote><blockquote>In the first step, an action was performed against Aramco company, as the largest financial source for Al-Saud regime. In this step, we penetrated a system of Aramco company by using the hacked systems in several countries and then sended a malicious virus to destroy thirty thousand computers networked in this company. The destruction operations began on Wednesday, Aug 15, 2012 at 11:08 AM (Local time in Saudi Arabia) and will be completed within a few hours.</blockquote><blockquote>This is a warning to the tyrants of this country and other countries that support such criminal disasters with injustice and oppression. We invite all anti-tyranny hacker groups all over the world to join this movement. We want them to support this movement by designing and performing such operations, if they are against tyranny and oppression.</blockquote><blockquote>Cutting Sword of Justice</blockquote><p>This post needs to be taken with a grain of salt, as there is no definitive way to tell if this is from the actor. Now they did have the exact detonation date which to me, is a clear sign that this is from the actual actor/s behind this attack. Now if we are to assume that this post is legit there are a couple things we can infer: This TA needs public visibility, they have ties to countries surrounding Saudi Arabia or are at least empathetic towards them, their major target is Al Saud which is the royal family in Saudi Arabia. Notably, this is also the first mention of the Cutting Sword of Justice. </p><p>Normally when we see attacks that are targeted like this, the goal tends to be data exfiltration and maintaining a low profile to reduce the risk of detection but this attack was the complete opposite. Clearly the intent was not to steal information, as even stranger is the impact that something like ransomware or intellectual property theft could've been, due to the amount of raw resources the company has. This all points to the idea that this attack was meant to damage perceptions in the public's eye as well as weaken the resulting country. </p><p>Of course all of this would cause Saudi Arabia to make determinations as to who was behind such an attack, which they promptly implicated Iran. The Saudi government issued an official statement blaming Iran for this attack. That decision could've solely been made due to their relations with Iran or for the fact that the PDB string of Shamoon contains the following <code>ArabianGulf</code> which is highly contested zone which Iran has always claimed that is it part of their country and should be properly named the Persian Gulf. Although this could also be a attempt at misdirection shifting blame towards Iran as APT groups tend to do. </p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://malwareindepth.com/content/images/2019/07/1645-004-A10ECCC8.jpg" class="kg-image"><figcaption>Arabian (Persian) Gulf</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>In addition to making this accusation Saudi Aramco made two major actions directly after attack: </p><ol><li>Fly employees to computer hardware factories and purchase as many hard drives as possible (50,000 at one time) </li><li>Lie about the attack, saying that operations had returned to normal when in fact they hadn't</li></ol><p>Saudi Aramco made the decision to call for external help as they didn't have the capability to handle an attack of this grandeur. Now Saudi Arabia didn't really have to many options for who they could call as they refuse to use any devices or personnel that originate from Israel, so they decided to call on Chris Kubecka and contract her to create a team to analyze the samples as well as setup a legitimate security program. </p><p>It turns out there wasn't much identifying information in the sample and due to Pastebin's operations, there was no way to track the paste back to a user let alone a country. So quickly things became pretty quiet as Saudi Aramco wasn't exactly making public statements nor was there new evidence about the group. This didn't sit well with The Cutting Sword of Justice and they followed up with a<a href="https://pastebin.com/AtN7dLeW"> second post </a>on Pastebin on August 29th 2012 at at 1:37 CDT.</p><blockquote>mon 29th aug, good day, SHN/AMOO/lib/pr/~/reversed</blockquote><blockquote>We think it's funny and weird that there are no news coming out from Saudi Aramco regarding Saturday's night. well, we expect that but just to make it more clear and prove that we're done with we promised, just read the following facts -valuable ones- about the company's systems:</blockquote><blockquote>internet service routers are three and their info as follows:<br>Core router:   SA-AR-CO-1#  password (telnet): c1sc0p@ss-ar-cr-tl  / (enable): c1sc0p@ss-ar-cr-bl<br>Backup router: SA-AR-CO-3#  password (telnet): c1sc0p@ss-ar-bk-tl  / (enable): c1sc0p@ss-ar-bk-bl<br>Middle router: SA-AR-CO-2#  password (telnet): c1sc0p@ss-ar-st-tl  / (enable): c1sc0p@ss-ar-st-bl</blockquote><blockquote>Khalid A.

When I see resources I will generally save them off for later analysis with<a href="http://www.angusj.com/resourcehacker/"> Resource Hacker</a>. Although these resources do contain relatively high entropy values, they aren't 7.99 or above the 7.9 threshold, which means if they are encrypted its through some rudimentary techniques rather than a well established technique like AES of RC4.</p><p>The next thing I look at is the strings. Strings can give information about actions the malware might take or if you're lucky, even a C2 string or raw IOCs. Immediately we see a string that we can use as an IOC due to it's hardcoded name and the fact that the file name will most likely be unique across hosts. </p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://malwareindepth.com/content/images/2019/07/image-2.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption>File Location String</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>Scrolling down we see a couple more strings that can prove valuable in understanding the behavior of this malware. </p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://malwareindepth.com/content/images/2019/07/image-3.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption>Interesting strings within the sample</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>We can see strings pointing to hardcoded file location, potential commandline execution, hardcoded domains etc. Considering the magnitude and impact that this attack had, I was somewhat surprised to see such low effort taken obfuscate their work.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://malwareindepth.com/content/images/2019/07/image-4.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption>Copyright string</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>Next I found a copyright string for the company Dinkumware.

The libraries they provide offer APIs to work with vectors, lists, sets, maps, bitsets and generic algorithms.</p><p>At the end of the list of strings found were the names of the resources mentioned earlier, X509, PKCS7 and PKCS12. This supports the hypothesis that Shamoon will interact with those resources during runtime. A large string pictured below stood out to me as there shouldn't be any reason for malware to require strings of this length.

When an actor takes the time to do this there is generally a purpose behind it. </p><p>Now looking back at <strong>sub_40286c</strong> we know that its going to copy memory into the newly allocated buffer and start a thread to schedule a task via the netap32.dll.

If this check fails Shamoon will not execute/drop the x509 resource. This is indicative that this resource might be performing some activity that is reliant on this specific architecture type or targeting something specific, so definitely worth looking into. Following the check, this function will call <strong>OpenSCManager</strong> which establishes a connection to the service manager.</p><p>For those that aren't aware, the service manager is an integral part of windows that will execute tasks at a given interval. It is also a technique that malware authors use to gain persistence in systems. </p><p>It then moves the resulting handle into EAX and checks to see if it can open a service with that handle name "TrkSvr". <strong>OpenService</strong> will return null if it was unable to get a handle so the "jz loc_40361A" instruction will only be taken if the TrkSrv service exists. </p><p>If the service exists it will then make a call to <strong>QueryServiceConfig</strong> which returns a non-zero value if the call was successful. So if the function is able to get a config for the TrkSrv service it will continue executing. </p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://malwareindepth.com/content/images/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-28-at-12.47.53-PM.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption>Assembly following x509 decryption</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>The calls to <strong>sub_4010AF</strong> are just string manipulation, most likely converting from ASCII to wide due to the system being windows.

That windows API call on 64 bit systems will change the way files are written to system32 directory. Per the MSDN <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/wow64apiset/nf-wow64apiset-wow64disablewow64fsredirection">documentation</a>:</p><blockquote>This function is useful for 32-bit applications that want to gain access to the native system32 directory.

Then it will create a file on disk with the name trksrv.exe (which is one of the strings that is manipulated in the earlier portions of the function. If the function was successful it will revert the system32 redirection and pop ESI to the stack which is the newly created file handle. </p><p>So now we know <strong>sub_401D5D</strong> is going to return a newly created file handle for trksrv.exe. Looking back at the caller <strong>sub_403491</strong> we are at the point right before the resource decryption function is called and we have a newly created file handle. </p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://malwareindepth.com/content/images/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-29-at-12.43.59-PM.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption>x509 write resource to disk</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>This process is exactly the same as the PKCS7 resource, it will decrypt based on the resource key and write the file to disk via the trksrv.exe file handle. </p><p>After the payload is written to disk, <strong>sub_4020FA</strong> is called which sole purpose is to change the file access, write and create time to the times of the initial Shamoon executable.

This function will set WideIPAddressString to 0 if the the result of GetIPAddress is 0. Otherwise it will set the value of the pointer to WideIPAddressString in the function. It then will get the windows directory in ASCII and in wide, then will check argv[1] to see what the value is. The two arguments that are processed for the payload are the ASCII "0" and "1", as seen below. </p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://malwareindepth.com/content/images/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-19-at-5.33.34-PM.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption>Argument control flow</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>If you pass a 0 as the first argument to the payload, it will do a subsequent check to see if there is a 2nd argument. if there is a second argument it will pass that to <strong>sub_402240</strong>, otherwise it will pass 0 to <strong>sub_402240</strong>.

The use of a hardcoded private IP address is unique and means that the Cutting Sword of Justice had access to Saudi Aramco's environment before creating and deploying Shamoon. So that hardcoded "home" and 10.1.252.19 serve as a C2 between the PKCS7 resource and the actor. </p><p>Considering this sample is 7 years old now and uses a private IP for its C2 there is no chance we will be able to properly emulate the C2 but from the control flow we can infer what the malware will do based on the results. </p><p>Once it gets a handle to the C2, a call to <strong>InternetReadFile</strong> is made and the read buffer is stored and used to determine what actions should be taken next.

This function takes 3 arguments, a string, privilege levels that will be passed to CreateFile and another string. </p><!--kg-card-begin: code--><pre><code>HANDLE ChangeNameOfPartitionAndGetHandleToPartition(char *str1, DWORD dwDesiredAccess, char *str2)</code></pre><!--kg-card-end: code--><p>Without going into detail for this function as its relatively straight forward, the first string is a filepath that is appended to "\\?\ElRawDisk". The only way this function executes properly is if that value starts with the characters "\\". The second argument is an access level and for this call is a generic read &amp; write. The 3rd string passed is a license key that is required for the wiper to run. After the "\\"  is appended to the path, it will append a "#" to the filename and then the license key that is the third argument. As an example if you have the following input string </p><blockquote>\\device\\harddisk1\\partiton0</blockquote><p>we would get a file handle back from </p><blockquote>\\device\\harddisk\\partiton0#8F71FF7E2831A...</blockquote><p>The driver requires a license key to run if you look at the implementation of it, and it will read from this filepath to get a valid key. For one to acquire a license key, they must register an account with <a href="https://www.eldos.com/">Eldos</a>. Understandably so, the company does not seem to offer the product anymore nor the free trial that was used in this attack. If one were to have access to the registration information that was used, it could yield potentially interesting information about the actor. </p><p>Once this function returns the handle to the specific partition with the license key appended to it we are back to looking at <strong>_wmain</strong>. </p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://malwareindepth.com/content/images/2019/11/Screen-Shot-2019-11-29-at-10.23.36-PM.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption>Thread creation for corrupting partitions with JPG buffer</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>The block before this gets the handle to the partition, which is held in ESI. It will write the picture buffer to the file and create a thread with the function <strong>sub_402F40</strong>. This function is arguably the most delicate code of the sample as it deals with overwriting portions of the disk partitions that we had seen earlier. </p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://malwareindepth.com/content/images/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-07-at-9.19.44-PM.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption>Thread function pseudo C++</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>Generally I am not a fan of relying on the decompiled code as a lot can be missed but considering all the nested loops and byte manipulation I felt that this was a better way to display the control flow. </p><p>As you can see this function is pretty complicated but I've done my best to rename the variables to informative names. The most important piece of this pseudo C is the section from line 76 to 86. These 7 lines are responsible for writing the picture buffer to the path passed within this function. First it makes 2 checks to compare the path passed into the function with the DeviceString and DeviceHardDiskString. Then it will get a file handle, where the filename for that handle has the serial key for the disk wiper appended to it after a #, and if that is successful, then the handle is passed to <strong>SetFilePointerAndWritePicture</strong> which will write the picture buffer over spans of memory for the handle being passed in. </p><p>So its clear that the purpose of this function is to take in a path, and start writing the image buffer to file at that path. With that I renamed <strong>Sub_402F40</strong> to <strong>WriteImageBufToPathThread</strong>. Now that we have looked at the thread function, we have analyzed all the pieces required for the loop we were just looking at in <strong>_wmain</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://malwareindepth.com/content/images/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-07-at-9.48.24-PM.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption>Complete partition corruption loop</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>This loop iterates over all of the partitions gathered from the registry and will write the picture buffer to random sections in each of the partitions. So while the functions we looked at were complex, looking at the high level picture really sheds a light as to what the sample attempts to do. </p><p>Now at the final section of <strong>_wmain</strong> we can see a call to <strong>Sub_4034B0</strong> or as I have renamed it <strong>DropElDosDiskWiperAndRestartMachine</strong>.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://malwareindepth.com/content/images/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-14-at-9.25.09-PM.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption>Corrupt partition0 and restart machine call</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>Once we enter this function ,we can see a call to CorruptPartition0AndRestartMachine with the argument \\Device\\Harddisk0\\Partition0. If you were to look at the threads that were just generated in a debugger you can see that it won't start a thread for corrupting Harddisk0\\Partition0, this is due to the fact that partition0 is a special case and points to the entire contents of Harddisk0. Where Harddisk0 is generally where the OS is installed and has to be corrupted last. </p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://malwareindepth.com/content/images/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-14-at-9.26.17-PM.png" class="kg-image"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>Once the handle to Partition0 is acquired it writes the the picture buffer to the beginning of the partition and promptly closes the handle to it continuing onward. Soon after the function will acquire a file handle for the string global variable <strong>dword_428D2C</strong>. Generally the function used to get a file handle is <strong>OpenFile</strong> but CreateFile can also be used to get the handle to the file passed. </p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://malwareindepth.com/content/images/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-08-at-2.27.44-PM.png" class="kg-image"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>If the initial CreateFile call fails, it will append a string to <strong>dword_428D2C</strong> and attempt to get the file handle again. If the handle is valid, we see a call again to <strong>SetFilePointerAndWritePicture</strong> with the newly acquired file handle.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://malwareindepth.com/content/images/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-08-at-2.34.01-PM.png" class="kg-image"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>Once the picture buffer is written to the file handle the function checks the length of the DeviceHardDisk string. While string length is its own  function in C <strong>wcslen</strong>, generally that function is inlined to others as its relatively small and removes the need to setup the function call for wcslen. </p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://malwareindepth.com/content/images/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-08-at-2.41.09-PM.png" class="kg-image"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>The snippet above calculates string length and checks whether the length of that DeviceHardDiskString is greater than 1. Assuming that the string is valid and contains the information expected, then a conditional is evaluated to check whether DeviceHardDiskString and DeviceStringCopy are the same value. </p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://malwareindepth.com/content/images/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-08-at-2.47.22-PM.png" class="kg-image"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>Just as wcslen is inlined when the program is compiled so is <strong>wcscmp</strong>. This section loads the two strings and checks whether they are the same values. If they are the same values, then we get into the critical portion of this function. </p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://malwareindepth.com/content/images/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-08-at-2.49.02-PM.png" class="kg-image"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>So at this point, if the length of DeviceHardDiskString is greater than 1, and it is the same as DeviceStringCopy, then we get into the assembly blocks in the screenshot above. The filepath being passed is the DeviceHardDiskString. The file at this path will have the EldoS key license appended to the filename after a "#" and the handle will be returned. The file handle that is returned is then passed to <strong>SetFilePointerAndWritePicture</strong> where the raw hard disk device will have the picture buffer written to it at the beginning of the raw device. </p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://malwareindepth.com/content/images/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-08-at-3.10.58-PM.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption>Get handle to partition0&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p> So the previous call we saw was writing the picture buffer to DeviceHardDiskString, whereas for this assembly snippet it works with DeviceString. Once it has a valid handle to the device, it will write the picture buffer to the device pointed at DeviceString. Its interesting to note that instead of writing over the entirety of the disk, the actors decided to just write over the first 1024 bytes. Its much quicker than writing over the device and is still nearly impossible to repair.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://malwareindepth.com/content/images/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-08-at-4.21.00-PM.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption>Write picture buffer to partition0 and send control code to device</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>With the valid handle, the picture buffer is written to the device. If the handle is still valid, it will pass the handle to <strong>DeviceIoControl</strong>. <strong>DeviceIoControl</strong> as described by MS does the following </p><blockquote>Sends a control code directly to a specified device driver, causing the corresponding device to perform the corresponding operation. </blockquote><p>With some quick googling, the control code that is sent is used to gather information about the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winioctl/ni-winioctl-ioctl_disk_get_partition_info_ex">drive</a>. A check is then done to make sure that the result is valid and if it has a length of 144 or more. </p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://malwareindepth.com/content/images/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-08-at-4.34.40-PM.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption>Reboot machine corrupting it entirely</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>If that check is successful, there is a final call to <strong>SetFilePointerAndWritePictureBuffer</strong>. This call takes in the handle of the same drive that was passed to DeviceIoControl. So in this case that would be the Harddisk0\\Partition0. This makes sense as it's the most critical portion of the system due to it containing the operating system and boot information. These effects won't have any effect as a lot of the required pieces for windows to run properly are held in memory while these overwrites are made to the hard disk. So this will require a full reboot for the corruption to take effect. As expected that call is made directly after the overwrite with a _system call to</p><blockquote>shutdown -r -f -t 2</blockquote><p>For a breakdown of the command, the -r signifies  the machine to restart, the -f forces applications to close without warning users, and the -t sets the time-out period to <em>2</em> seconds before the restart starts. </p><p>At this point Shamoon has gone through its entire infection chain and has successfully corrupted all the partitions and restarted the computer leaving the machine inoperable. </p><h2 id="shamoon-payload-pkcs12-conclusion">Shamoon Payload PKCS12 Conclusion</h2><p>This is the final payload in Shamoon's arsenal and once completed renders the machine inoperable. In conjunction with the communications module, Shamoon offers a powerful toolkit that proved by time allows the actors to reuse and adapt the codebase. </p><h2 id="shamoon-payload-x509-analysis">Shamoon Payload x509 Analysis</h2><p>Now if you've been paying attention you might have realized that I haven't touched on the x509 resource. This is due to the fact that the x509 resource is a product of the same exact code, just compiled for a 64 bit architecture. So the 64 bit version only has 2 resources. 1 being the communcations module and another being the actual wiper that contains the EldoS driver and corruption mechanism. Pictures of PE studio output can be found below but I feel that it is out of scope to dive deep into the 64 bit module as it shares almost exactly the same behavior as the 32 bit client. </p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://malwareindepth.com/content/images/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-14-at-3.15.19-PM.png" class="kg-image"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://malwareindepth.com/content/images/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-14-at-3.15.32-PM.png" class="kg-image"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>I hope this overview was able to help teach some about the history of the first Shamoon campaign the world has seen. This has been a work in progress for almost 6 months now and I've met a ton of great people. If there are any questions or mistakes feel free to reach out. I am a human as well and therefore make tons of mistakes just like the rest of the world. Any feedback about the content, length of post, or format of the post would also be greatly appreciated. I think going forward I will try to keep them a tad shorter and more frequent. If there is interest I will continue going over the next shamoon campaigns as there are signifcant changes to how strings are obfsucated, resources encrypted, and dropping techniques. Below are a couple of high level visuals and information that might prove useful to some. </p><h2 id="shamoon-2012-killchain">Shamoon 2012 Killchain</h2><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://malwareindepth.com/content/images/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-14-at-8.45.57-PM.png" class="kg-image"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><h2 id="iocs">IOCs</h2><!--kg-card-begin: html--><style type="text/css">
