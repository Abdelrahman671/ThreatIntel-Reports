Cisco Talos is providing an update on its two recent reports on a new and ongoing campaign where Turla,
a Russian espionage group, deployed their TinyTurla-NG (TTNG) implant. We now have new information
on the entire kill chain this actor uses, including the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) utilized to
steal valuable information from their victims and propagate through their infected enterprises. 
Talos’ analysis, in coordination with CERT.NGO, reveals that Turla infected multiple systems in the
compromised network of a European non-governmental organization (NGO). 
The attackers compromised the first system, established persistence and added exclusions to anti-
virus products running on these endpoints as part of their preliminary post-compromise actions. 
Turla then opened additional channels of communication via Chisel for data exfiltration and to pivot
to additional accessible systems in the network.
Tracing Turla’s steps from compromise to exfiltration
2/6
Talos discovered that post-compromise activity carried out by Turla in this intrusion isn’t restricted to the
sole deployment of their backdoors. Before deploying TinyTurla-NG, Turla will attempt to configure anti-
virus software exclusions to evade detection of their backdoor. Once exclusions have been set up, TTNG
is written to the disk, and persistence is established by creating a malicious service.
Preliminary post-compromise activity and TinyTurla-NG
deployment
After gaining initial access, Turla first adds exclusions in the anti-virus software, such as Microsoft
Defender, to locations they will use to host the implant on the compromised systems.

Turla then sets up the persistence of the TinyTurla-NG implants using one or more batch (BAT) files. The
batch files create a service on the system to persist the TTNG DLL on the system. 
ACTION
INTENT
reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows
NT\CurrentVersion\Svchost" /v sysman /t REG_MULTI_SZ /d

sc config sdm DisplayName= "System Device Manager"
sc description sdm "Creates and manages system-mode driver
processes. This service cannot be stopped."

Windows Service
This technique is identical to that used by Turla in 2021 to achieve persistence for their TinyTurla
implants. However, we’re still unsure why the actor uses two different batch files, but it seems to be an
unnecessarily convoluted approach to evade detections.
In the case of TTNG, the service is created with the name “sdm” masquerading as a “System Device
Manager” service.

Batch file contents.
The creation and start of the malicious service kick starts the execution of the TinyTurla-NG implant via
svchost[.]exe (Windows’ service container). TinyTurla-NG is instrumented further to conduct additional
reconnaissance of directories of interest and then copy files to a temporary staging directory on the
infected system, followed by subsequent exfiltration to the C2. TinyTurla-NG is also used to deploy a
custom-built Chisel beacon from the open-sourced offensive framework.
Custom Chisel usage
On deployment, Chisel will set up a reverse proxy tunnel to an attacker-controlled box [T1573.002 -
Encrypted Channel: Asymmetric Cryptography]. We’ve observed that the attackers leveraged the chisel
connection to the initially compromised system, to pivot to other systems in the network. 
The presence of Windows Remote Management (WinRM)-based connections on the target systems
indicates that chisel was likely used in conjunction with other tools, such as proxy chains and evil-winrm
to establish remote sessions. WinRM is Microsoft’s implementation of the WS-Management protocol and
allows Windows-based systems to exchange information and be administered using scripts or built-in
utilities.
The overall infection chain is visualized below.

Turla tactics, tools and procedures flow.
Once the attackers have gained access to a new box, they will repeat their activities to create Microsoft
Defender exclusions, drop the malware components, and create persistence, indicating that Turla follows
a playbook that can be articulated as the following cyber kill chain.
5/6
Cyber kill chain.
Analyzing the traffic originating from Chisel revealed the tool beaconed back to its C2 server every hour.
While the infected systems were compromised as early as October 2023 and Chisel was deployed as
late as December 2023, Turla operators conducted the majority of their data exfiltration over using Chisel
much later on Jan. 12, 2024 [T1041 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel].
