Iranian Cyber Actor s’ Brute Force and 
Credential Access Activity  Compromise s 
Critical Infrastructure  Organizations  
Summary  
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI),  the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the 
National Security Agency  (NSA) , the Communications Security Establishment Canada (CSE) , the Australian 
Federal Police (AFP), and Australian Signals Directorate ’s Australian Cyber Security Centre  (ASD ’s ACSC)  
are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to warn network defenders of Iranian cyber actor s’ use of 
brute force and other techniques to compromise  organizations across  multiple critical infrastructure 
sectors, including  the healthcare and public health (HPH), government , information technology , 
engineering , and energy sectors . The actor s likely  aim to obtain credentials and  information  describing the 
victim’s network  that can then be sold to enable access to cybercriminals.  
Since October  2023, Iranian actor s have used brute force , such as  password spraying , and multi-factor 
authentication  (MFA)  ‘push bombing ’ to compromise user accounts and obtain access to organizations . 
The actors frequently  modif ied MFA registrations , enabl ing persistent access.  The actor s perform ed 
discovery on the compromised networks to obtain additional credentials and identify other information that 
could  be used to gain additional points of access. The authoring agencies  assess the Iranian actors sell 
this information on cybercriminal  forums to  actors who may use the information to conduct  additional  
malicious activity .

TLP:CLEAR  This advisory provides the actor s’ tactics, techniques,  and procedures (TTPs) and indicators of compromise 
(IOCs). The information is derived from FBI engagements with entities impacted by this malicious activity.  
The authoring agencies  recommend critical infrastructure organizations follow  the guidance provided in the 
Mitigations  section. At a minimum , organizations should ensure all accounts use strong passwords and 
register a second form of authentication.  
Technical Details  
Note:  This advisory uses the MITRE ATT&CK® for Enterprise  framework, version 1 5. See the MITRE ATT&CK 
Tactics and Techniques  section  in Appendix A  for a table of the actors’ activity mapped to MITRE ATT&CK 
tactics and techniques.  
Overview of Activity  
The actor s likely conduct reconnaissance operations  to gather victim identity [T1589 ] information. Once 
obtained , the actor s gain persistent access to victim  networks  frequently  via brute force [T1110 ]. After 
gaining access, the actor s use a variety  of techniques to further gather credentials, escalate privileges, and 
gain information about the entity’s systems and network. The actor s also move laterally and download 
information that could assist other actors with access and exploitation . 
Initial Access and Persistence  
The actor s use valid user and group email accounts [T1078 ], frequently  obtained via brute force such as  
password spraying [ T1110.003 ] although other times via unknown methods , to obtain initial access to 
Microsoft 365, Azure [ T1078.004 ], and Citrix systems [ T1133 ]. In some cases where push  notification -
based MFA was enabled, the actor s send  MFA requests to legitimate users  seeking  accept ance of  the 
request. This technique —bombard ing users with mobile ph one push notifications until the user either 
approves the request by accident or stop s the notifications — is known as “MFA fatigue” or “push bombing” 
[T1621 ]. 
Once t he threat actor s gain access to an account, they  frequently  register  their devices with MFA to protect 
their access to the environment via the valid account:  
• In two confirmed compromises, the actor s leveraged  a compromised user’s open registration for 
MFA [ T1556.006 ] to register the actor’s own device [ T1098.00 5] to access  the environment.  
• In another confirmed compromise, the actor s used a  self-service  password reset (SSPR) tool 
associated with a public facing Active Directory Federation Service (ADFS ) to reset the  accounts 
with expired passwords  [T1484.002 ] and then register ed MFA through Okta for compromised 
accounts without MFA already enabled [T1556 ] [T1556.006 ]. 
The actor s frequently conduct their activity using a virtual private network (VPN)  service  [T1572 ]. Several of 
the IP addresses in the actors’ malicious activity originate from exit nodes tied to the Private Internet 
Access VPN service .

TLP:CLEAR  Lateral  Movement  
The actor s use Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) for lateral movement  [T1021.001 ]. In one instance, the 
actor s used Microsoft Word to open PowerShell to launch the RDP binary mstsc.exe  [T1202 ]. 
Credential Access  
The actors  likely use open -source tools and methodologies to gather more credentials . The actor s 
perform ed Kerberos Service  Principal  Name  (SPN) enumeration of several service accounts and received 
Kerberos tickets [ T1558.003 ]. In one instance, the actor s used the A ctive Directory (AD)  Microsoft Graph 
Application Program Interface (API)  PowerShell application likely to perform a directory dump of all AD 
accounts . Also, t he actor s imported the tool  [T1105 ] DomainPasswordSpray.ps1 , which is  openly 
available on GitHub  [T1588.002 ], likely to conduct password spray ing. The actor s also used the command 
Cmdkey /list , likely  to display usernames  and credentials [ T1555 ]. 
Privilege Escalation  
In one instance , the actor s attempted impersonation of the domain controller , likely by exploiting 
Micro soft’s  Netlogon  (also known as “Zerologon” ) privilege escalation vulnerability (CVE -2020 -1472)  
[T1068 ]. 
Discovery  
The actor s leverage living off the land (LOTL)  to gain knowledge about the target systems and internal 
networks. The  actor s used the following Windows command -line tool s to gather information about domain 
controllers [ T1018 ], trusted domains [ T1482 ], lists of domain administrators, and enterprise 
administrators [ T1087.002 ] [T1069.002 ] [T1069.003 ]: 
• Nltest /dclist  
• Nltest /domain_trusts  
• Nltest /domain_trusts/all_trusts  
• Net group “ Enterprise admins” /domain  
• Net group “ Domain admins” /domain  
Next, t he actor s used the following Lightweight Directory A ccess Protocol ( LDAP ) query in  PowerShell  
[T1059.001 ] to search  the AD for computer  display names, operating systems, descriptions, and 
distinguished names  [T1082 ]. 
$i=0 
$D= 
[System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectory.Domain]::GetCurrentDomain () 
$L='LDAP://'  . $D 
$D = [ADSI]$L

 $CA.Properties.Item('distinguishedName' ) 
 $i++ 
} 
Write-host Total servers: $i  
Command and Control  
On one occasion , using msedge.exe , the actor s likely made outbound connections to Cobalt Strike 
Beacon command and control (C2) i nfrastructur e [T1071.001 ]. 
Exfiltration and Collection  
In a couple instances, w hile logged in to victim accounts,  the actor s downloaded files related to gaining 
remote access to the organization  and to the organization’s  inventory  [T1005 ], likely exfiltrat ing the files  to 
further  persist in the victim network or to sell the information online . 
Detection  
To detect brute force  activity,  the authoring agencies  recommend  review ing authentication logs for system 
and application login failures of valid accounts  and l ooking for multiple, failed authentication attempts 
across all accounts.  
To detect  the use of co mpromised credentials in combination with virtual infrastructure, the authoring 
agencies  recommend the follow ing steps:  
▪ Look for “impossible logins,” such as suspicious logins with changing username s, user agent 
strings, and IP address combinations or logi ns where IP addresses do not align to the user’s 
expected geographic location.  
▪ Look for one IP used for multiple accounts, excluding expected logins.  
▪ Look for “impossible travel.” Impossible travel occurs when a user logs in from multiple IP 
addresses with significant geographic distance (i.e., a person could not realistically travel between 
the geographic locations  of the two IP addresses during the period between the logins). Note:  
Implementing this detection opportunity can result in false positives if legitimate users apply VPN 
solutions before connecting into networks.  
▪ Look for MFA registrations with MFA in unexpected locales  or from unfamiliar devices . 
▪ Look for processes and program execution command -line arguments that may indicate credential 
dump ing, especially attempts to access  or copy the ntds.dit  file from a domain controller.  
 
  FBI | CISA | NSA | CSE | AFP | ASD ACSC  
  TLP:CLEAR  
Page 5 of 15  |  Product ID : AA24 -290A 
TLP:CLEAR  ▪ Look for suspicious privileged account use after resetting passwords or applying user account 
mitigations.  
▪ Look for unusual activity in typically dormant accounts.  
▪ Look for unusual user agent strings, such as strings not typically associated with normal user 
activity, which may indicate bot activity.  
Mitigation s 
The authoring agencies  recommend organizations implement the mitigations below to improve 
organizations ’ cybers ecurity posture based on  the actor s’ TTPs  described in this advisory . These 
mitigations align with the Cross -Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs) developed by CISA. The 
CPGs , which are organized to align to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 
Cybersecurity Framework,  are a subset of cybersecurity practices, aimed at meaningfully reducing risks to 
both critical infrastructure operations and the American people. These voluntary CPGs strive to help small - 
and medium -sized organizations kick -start their  cybersecurity efforts by prioritizing investment in a limited 
number of essential actions with high -impact security outcomes. Visit CISA’s Cross -Sector Cybersecurity 
Performance Goals  for more information on the CPGs, including additional recommended baseline 
protections.  
▪ Review IT helpdesk password management related to initial passwords, password resets for user 
lockouts, and shared acco unts. IT helpdesk password procedures may not align to company policy 
for user verification or password strength, creating a security gap. Avoid common passwords (e.g. 
“Spring2024” or “Password123!” ). 
▪ Disable user accounts and access to organizational reso urces for departing staff [ CPG 2.D ]. 
Disabling accounts can minimize system exposure, removing options actors can leverage for  entry 
into the system. Similarly, create new user accounts as close as possible to an employee’s start 
date.  
▪ Implement  phishing -resistant MFA [CPG 2.H ]. See CISA’s resources Phishing -Resistant Multifactor 
Authentication  and More than a Password  for additional information  on strengthening user 
credentials . 
▪ Continuously review MFA settings to ensure coverage over all active, internet -facing protocols to 
ensure no exploitable services are exposed  [CPG 2.W ]. 
▪ Provide basic cybersecurity training to use rs [CPG 2.I ] covering concepts such as : 
o Detecting unsuccessful login attempts [ CPG 2.G ]. 
o Having users d eny MFA requests they have not generated . 
o Ensuring users with  MFA-enabled  accounts  have MFA set up appropriately . 
▪ Ensure password policies align with the latest NIST Digital Identity Guidelines . 
o Meeting the minimum password strength [ CPG 2.B ] by creating a password  using 8-64 
nonstandard characters  and long passphrases , when possible . 
▪ Disable the  use of RC4 for Kerberos authentication.

  TLP:CLEAR  
Page 6 of 15  |  Product ID : AA24 -290A 
TLP:CLEAR  These mitigations apply to critical infrastructure entities  across sectors .  
The authoring agencies  also recommend  software manufacturers  incorporate secure  by design principles 
and tactics into their software development practices to protect their customers against actors using 
compromised credentials , thereby  strengthening the security posture of their cust omers.  For more 
information on secure by design, see CISA’s Secure by Design  webpage and joint guide . 
Validate Security Controls  
In addition to applying mitigations, the authoring agencies  recommend exercising, testing, and validating 
organization security program s against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK for Enterprise 
framework in this advisory . The authoring agencies  recommend testing your existing security controls 
inventory to assess how they perform against the ATT&CK techniques described in this advisory.  
To get started:  
1. Select  an ATT&CK technique described  in this advisory  (see Table 1  to Table 12). 
2. Align your security technologies against the technique.  
3. Test your technologies against the technique.  
4. Analyze your detection and prevention technologies ’ performance.  
5. Repeat the process for all security technologies to obtain a set of comprehensive performance 
data.  
6. Tune your security program, including people, processes, and technologies, based on the data 
generated by this process.  
The authoring agencies  recommend continually testing your security program, at scale, in a production 
environment to ensure optimal performance against the MITRE ATT&CK techniques identified in this 
advisory.

Table 14: Network Indicators  
Disclaimer:  The authoring organizations recommend network defenders investigate or vet IP addresses 
prior to taking action, such as blocking, as many cyber actors are known to change IP addresses, 
sometimes daily, and some IP addresses may host valid domains.  Many of  the IP addresses provided 
below are assessed VPN nodes and as such are not exclusive to the Iranian actors’ use. The authoring 
organizations do not recommend blocking these IP addresses based solely on their inclusion in this JCSA. 
The authoring organizat ions recommend using the below IP addresses to search for previous activity the 
actors may have conducted against networks. If positive hits for these IP addresses are identified, the 
authoring organizations recommend making an independent determination if  the observed activity aligns 
with the TTPs outlined in the JCSA. The timeframes included in the table reflect the timeframe the actors 
likely used the IPs.
