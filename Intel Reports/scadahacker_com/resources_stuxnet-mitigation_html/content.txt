<h1 class="title">Stuxnet Mitigation</h1>
<div class="entry">
<p>There are a lot of experts, some with and some without any relevant
control systems experience, who are today offering advice regarding how
to handle Stuxnet and Stuxnet-like attacks.&nbsp; One thing is pretty
much agreed to by all:&nbsp; while no single solution will block an
attack like Stuxnet, a comprehensive solution of countermeasures
including process and policy can significantly reduce the negative
consequences that result from such an attack. &nbsp; </p>
<p>Knowing this in advance means that any mitigation strategy needs to
be based on a solid defense-in-depth strategy that utilizes multiple,
independent layers of protection. The members of the CSFI Stuxnet
Project agree that while it will always be possible to find flaws in
any one solution it should be increasingly difficult to find and
exploit flaws in a comprehensive solution that depends on multiple
protective measures.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p>The concept proposed breaks the situation down into two distinct
phases: <strong><em>Prevention</em></strong> and <strong><em>Reaction</em></strong>.
The first set of countermeasures should be <span class="style7"><strong>
preventative</strong></span> in nature, and designed to minimize the
likelihood that a control system could be infected by such an attack.
The second, and equally important, set of countermeasures should be <span class="style7"><strong>reactive</strong></span> in nature, and
designed to minimize any negative consequences to the control system
should the system be compromised. Each of these sets of countermeasures
should also possess both <span class="style7"><strong>passive</strong></span>
and <span class="style7"><strong>active</strong></span> components
that utilize direct and indirect methods in responding to the event.
These countermeasures are then implemented in real-time based on the
impact of the attack and the duration of the attack (which correlates
into the likelihood of greater damage or negative consequences).&nbsp;
&nbsp; </p>
<p>The figure below illustrates this concept: &nbsp; </p>
<p class="style8"> <img alt="Mitigation Matrix" src="../images/mitigation_matrix.png" height="306" width="337" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Let us explore this concept more as
countermeasures are applied.&nbsp; This list is meant to be used as
guidance to possible countermeasures which could be deployed and should
not be interpreted as a list which all items are required for every
installation.<o:p /></span></p>

<h2 class="title">Preventative - Passive</h2>
<div class="entry">
<p> These âpreventativeâ countermeasures have revealed the general lack
of an existing strong security policy within the control systems
environments and reflect security controls that that should be
implemented on all systems prior to a Stuxnet-like event.&nbsp; These
countermeasures include: &nbsp;
Â·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
  <li>Effective security policies and procedures.<br />
Policies and Procedures are the first step to securing control systems.
&nbsp;These policies and procedures then need to be reviewed and
updated as part of a continuous improvement program.</li>
  <li>Security Policies should be created that address specific
host-to-host and zone-to-zone communication requirements, including
protocols, ports, etc.&nbsp; <br />
This information is vital and will be used in subsequent
countermeasures to identify suspect traffic, and is a basic requirement
in complying with ISA-99 standards. </li>
  <li>Implement a Security Awareness Program within the organization.
&nbsp; <br />
Consistent results require a baseline level of education relating to
control systems security among operational and planning staff, and must
include regular re-training as risks and technologies change. </li>
  <li>Disabling of USB devices within the more secure control systems
âzonesâ (security âzonesâ as defined by ISA-99). </li>
  <li>Implementation of Software Restriction Policies (SRP) that
prevent the execution of code on remote and removable media (USB,
CD/DVD, network shares, etc.).&nbsp; <br />
Exceptions can be granted on a limited basis when required to support
software maintenance and upgrades.&nbsp; Microsoft introduced this
functionality with Windows XP, yet few implement its policies.&nbsp;
Until and unless the control systems world is completely off of Windows
2000 and Windows XP platforms, this will remain a very viable
countermeasure. </li>
  <li>Follow the vendorâs recommendations for disabling of all
unnecessary services. </li>
  <li>Confirm that any default username/passwords have been removed or
modified.&nbsp; </li>
  <li>Confirm that any unnecessary services have been removed and or
isolated based on a need to access. </li>
  <li>Guidelines such as those published in the U.S. Dept. of Homeland
Security Control Systems Security Program document âCyber Security
Procurement Language for Control Systemsâ should be adhered to as much
as possible, especially in regards to any hard-coded passwords that may
be engineered by the software developer.&nbsp; Role-based Access
Control should be considered to minimize risks that could be introduced
from hard-coded vendor passwords. </li>
  <li>Utilize active vulnerability scanners on these systems (at
minimum during testing or other times of non-production use) to
evaluate and document the configuration against known vulnerabilities
and predetermine compliance guidelines. The fact that Stuxnet is using
MS08-067 shows that (1) vendors may not even be aware of the power of
exploiting this vulnerability, or (2) they are assuming that no one
will target these systems and there is not a need to address this
patch. &nbsp;This vulnerability is seen today on many systems and is
one of the most common vulnerabilities used to exploit control systems.
  </li>
  <li>Implement a comprehensive Patch Management Program that regularly
updates operating systems and installed applications in accordance with
vendor guidelines and approval of hotfixes, patches, and relevant
security updates. Systems should be audited to ensure that updates are
installed on a regular basis.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<!-- end #entry -->
<h2 class="title">Preventative - Active</h2>
<div class="entry">
<ul>
  <li>If allowed by the system vendor, integrator and facility
owner/operator, all hosts should be installed with applicable
host-based firewall, anti-virus and anti-malware applications. </li>
  <li>Host-based intrusion detection applications should be utilized
where allowed.&nbsp; <br />
Some tests have shown that certain activities of Stuxnet would have
triggered HIDS alerts, including DLL injection and rootkit installation
attempts. </li>
  <li>Implement non-repudiation methods for accountable logging. <br />
All uses of any of the related systems should be identified using a
physical device, and every activity should be logged and directly
associated with that user. &nbsp;Every activity â from logging in,
connecting devices, data activities, and network activities should be
traceable to a specific person in order to provide better forensic
ability as well as a deterring factor. </li>
  <li>Logging of events should not be performed on the same device
which generates the logs but should write identical logs to a separate
device for pre- and post-event analysis.&nbsp; <br />
This also helps minimize the possibility of an attacker âhiding their
tracksâ and altering system logs. &nbsp;Security Information and Event
Management (SIEM) systems are designed for precisely this purpose and
will securely maintain audit trails regardless of attacks against other
systems on the control system network. </li>
  <li>âWhitelistingâ based security applications should be considered
over âblacklistingâ or âheuristicâ based solutions whenever possible to
increase the likelihood that zero-days will be detected. </li>
  <li>Firewall rules should be implemented that âdeny by defaultâ all
outbound traffic from the control system networks and zones. <br />
Justification needs to be given for outbound access, just like it is
required for inbound, &nbsp;When outbound traffic must be allowed it
should be between specific hosts for specific services based on
business needs. </li>
  <li>Utilize code signing of all critical systems (in addition to
whitelisting). <br />
Updates and changes should go through a unique traceable process at
which code should be compared to an out-of-band provided signature from
the vendor. Unless verified, code should not be allowed to the system. </li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2 class="title">Reactive - Passive</h2>
<div class="entry">
<p>Identification of a threat (or even a âpotentialâ threat) is a very
valuable aspect of minimizing negative consequences of an attack.&nbsp;
It may not be possible to eliminate completely all threats that exploit
zero-days, but it should be a goal to be able to identify suspect
activity that could signify an attack and minimize the consequences. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems should
be installed to automatically analyze and correlate the data that is
generated and stored in system logs and event journals throughout the
control system network. <br />
Without SIEM it is virtually impossible to (1) analyze all this data,
and (2) make any logic correlation of the data between various
hosts.&nbsp; </li>
  <li>Implement intrusion monitoring systems integrated with SIEM
within control systems networks.<br />
These systems will evaluate data traffic patterns between system
components, creating a baseline of acceptable network use. &nbsp;Use
the data obtained from the security policy to map out the allowed data
paths that should exist within the system architecture and implement
rules or alerts to identify deviations from these patterns and generate
notifications via the SIEM. </li>
  <li>Implement âExtrusion Detectionâ which when configured and
deployed properly, will generate alerts and or alarms for potential
client side attacks. <br />
Rules needs to be create that look at âWhat is LEAVING the system: Who,
What, When, Where and How.â </li>
  <li>Implement passive vulnerability scanners (PVS) on the control
systems network that can be used to observe any unusual traffic
patterns and correlate this against previous patterns, and provide an
alert mechanism to signal deviations from normal.&nbsp; <br />
PVS can be used in conjunction with IDS with all alerts consolidated
and reconciled within the SIEM. </li>
  <li>Implement a SCADA honeypot or identical system on the same
network which can be periodically scanned and tested using more
âaggressiveâ methods, and will not impact normal operation or
production.&nbsp; <br />
Set up test and validation systems that mimic the production systems
(at least for all the critical components), and implement a recurring
comparison process between the production and test systems.&nbsp;
Financial institutions have used this approach for several years, and
should be considered for critical infrastructure protection as well. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<!-- end #entry -->
<h2 class="title">Reactive - Active</h2>
<div class="entry">
<p>At this point in the attack, it may be possible to use the knowledge
of the attack to stop it. &nbsp;In any case, it is very important to
securely maintain forensic data that can be used for active mitigation
and/or post-event analysis. &nbsp;Most of these security measures are
used for forensic purposes in learning what failed and what can be done
to prevent a similar attack in the future. </p>
<ul>
  <li>When an attack is identified, operational staff or automated
procedures should use the knowledge of the attack to possibly isolate
affected hosts, segments or networks until they can be trusted and
placed back into service. <br />
Switches, routers, firewalls and the hosts themselves can be used to
isolate an attack in progress. </li>
  <li>Once the attack has been confirmed, all non-essential
communication conduits should be filtered and closely monitoring to
contain the attack while not negatively impacting plant operation. </li>
  <li>Reactive plans should be in place, tested on a recurring basis,
and updated in order to be effective in the event of an attack. </li>
  <li>Incident Response and Business Continuity procedures should be in
place and initiated to maintain or re-establish essential operations
while recovering from an attack. </li>
  <li>Care needs to be taken in following established and rehearsed
forensic procedures to maintain the integrity of the data contained
within the infected systems. </li>
</ul>
<p>As a last resort, it may be necessary to initiate a shutdown of the
process under the control of the affected automation system to minimize
the potential for environmental or loss-of-life resulting from a
potential control system failure. &nbsp;Disaster Recovery Planning can
assist by allowing an operator to place a âstandbyâ machine in active
mode during potential shutdown. </p>
