Distributed Malware Exploiting Vulnerable Innorix: Andariel
eastston ⋮ ⋮ 2/15/2023
The AhnLab Security Emergengy response Center (ASEC) analysis team confirmed the distribution of malicious
codes targeting users of the vulnerable version of Innorix Agent. The secured malicious code tries to connect to the
C&C server through a backdoor.

[Figure 1] Korea Internet & Security Agency Vulnerability Security Update Notice [1]
The Innorix Agent program that was exploited for distribution is a file transfer solution client program. The Korea
Internet & Security Agency (KISA) [1] published information about the vulnerability and recommended a security
update to INNORIX Agent 9.2.18.450 and 9.2.18.418 corresponding to previous versions. confirmed with

[Figure 2] ASD infrastructure detection log
The detected backdoor attempts to connect to the C&C server. Its main function is to collect and transmit information
on the user's PC, as well as to capture screens and create and execute files.
[Figure 3] ASD infrastructure detection report
The confirmed backdoor was a form with two external appearances, the form initially discovered was confirmed to be
developed in C/C++, and the recently detected sample was produced in .Net. There is no difference in function
between the two forms, and in some detection reports, it was confirmed that when registering malicious code in the
task scheduler, it uses the method of concealment by using the company name (AhnLab) in the task name.

[Figure 4] Encoding and decoding routines
This malicious code classified as a backdoor uses data using the routine shown in [Figure 4] when receiving data,
and transmits data using the same method when sending data. Data is encrypted and transmitted through encoding
and decoding routines, bypassing packet-level monitoring, and can be seen as a feature of Andardoor based on its
diagnosis. The key value is 74615104773254458995125212023273 , which is the same as the XOR key value
specified in
the CISA report [2] written in 2017 .
Recently, the form of distribution as a vulnerability in software has been confirmed, so corporate users and general
users need to pay special attention. Vulnerable versions of software should be managed for use after updating.
