The Travels of “markopolo”: 
Self-Proclaimed Meeting Software Vortax 
Spreads Infostealers, Unveils Expansive 
Network of Malicious macOS Applications
Vortax, a self-proclaimed virtual 
meeting software, proliferates 
infostealer malware at scale in a 
cross-platform campaign targeting 
cryptocurrency users on social media.
Further investigation into Vortax 
revealed a sprawling infostealer 
operation, attributed to the Atomic 
macOS Stealer (AMOS) user 
"markopolo" — previously identified 
targeting Web3 gaming.
"markopolo" is an agile, adaptable, 
and versatile threat actor that 
quickly pivots their scams upon 
detection, which is likely indicative 
of a long-term credential harvesting 
strategy.

Analysis cut-off date: May 15, 2024
Executive Summary
While monitoring data in Recorded Future Malware Intelligence, Insikt Group identified purported virtual
meeting software called Vortax that, upon download and installation, delivers three information stealers
(“infostealers”) in cross-platform attacks — Rhadamanthys, Stealc, and, most notably, Atomic macOS
Stealer (AMOS) — in an extensive campaign aimed at cryptocurrency theft. AMOS typically has a niche
client base because of its high barrier to entry, its low success rate, and the lower demand for macOS
infostealers in the cybercriminal underground. AMOS is not often observed in the wild, relative to its
Windows-based counterparts, which makes observing such extensive activity around AMOS, including
diverse scams, targets, and infrastructure in a single campaign, particularly noteworthy. This campaign,
operated by the threat actor tracked as “markopolo”, and its wide-ranging implications also likely signal
that future AMOS campaigns will employ similar tactics to spread — resulting in a long-term increase in
the volume of AMOS victims.
While macOS stealers are generally less popular than their Windows counterparts, demand is growing,
evidenced by an increase in macOS infostealer submissions to Recorded Future Malware Intelligence
and an increased volume of references to macOS malware on the dark web. The high volume of AMOS
activity observed in this campaign builds on previous Insikt Group reporting, which found that mentions
of macOS malware and exploit kits increased by 79% year-on-year from 2022 to 2023, which may
indicate a correlation between the overall number of references to macOS malware and the increased
frequency of AMOS campaigns observed in the wild (1, 2).
Upon further investigation of the Vortax application, its network of associated accounts, and the
malware it deployed, Insikt Group identified 23 other malicious macOS applications masquerading as
legitimate — with the majority of scams identified targeting virtual meeting software and
cryptocurrency users. We also identified connections between the “Vortax campaign” and a previous
infostealer campaign targeting Web3 gaming projects. Based on these findings, we are confident that
the two campaigns are affiliated with the same threat actor — previously identified by Insikt Group as
using the AMOS UserID “markopolo”. Given its tight-knit community, we assess that other operators of
AMOS will likely model future campaigns after the success of markopolo. This may result in a wider
proliferation of AMOS in the wild, accompanied by diverse and wide-ranging campaigns attributed to
individual threat actors, exacerbating the long-term threat of a less secure landscape for macOS users.
The Vortax campaign identified in this report is a classic example of the adaptive and scalable nature of
malware operations. Given the widespread proliferation of AMOS and the diversity of scams identified
in this report, we assess that defenders must consider in-house active security controls that limit an
end user’s ability to download unapproved “freemium” software, which is the primary vector employed
in this campaign. Blocking all downloads represents a short-term fix, though this will likely be difficult to
sustain at scale. Longer-term mitigations will require processes to help vet software products to ensure
legitimacy, so as to avoid user execution and an AMOS infection. Once AMOS is on a victim’s system, it
1

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS
is difficult to detect and monitor due to its “smash-and-grab” nature; therefore, preventive measures
must prioritize controlling such activity prior to an infection.
The ability of threat actors like markopolo to pivot their operations and maintain campaign continuity,
often on a moment’s notice, poses a significant brand impairment threat to organizations without
visibility into, and the capacity to cluster, these campaigns. As with the Web3 campaign referenced
above, organizations should seek to insulate themselves from potential impersonation scams and the
potential reputational damage of such scams. As we have identified markopolo impersonating several
legitimate software downloads (such as “Zoom”, in Table 4), we note that organizations should be
aware of infostealer operators impersonating their brands to deliver malware. Aside from a risk to
legitimate brands, organizations should understand that infostealer infections have follow-on
operational and financial consequences.
Key Findings
●
Insikt Group identified a malicious application on social media called Vortax that is connected to
multiple ongoing scams targeting macOS users. The campaign detailed in this report has
connections to a campaign previously reported by Insikt Group (“Cybercriminal Campaign
Spreads Infostealers, Highlighting Risks to Web3 Gaming”), suggesting that the same threat
actor operates both campaigns. This also suggests that the threat actor has broadened the
scope of its operations and expanded its targeting beyond Web3 gaming to masquerading as
virtual meeting applications that primarily target cryptocurrency users.
●
The threat actor that operates this campaign, identified as markopolo, leverages shared hosting
and C2 infrastructure for all of the builds (Table 4) identified in this report. This suggests that
the threat actor relies on convenience to enable an agile campaign, quickly abandoning scams
once they are detected or producing diminishing returns, and pivoting to new lures.
●
This scaled campaign is likely indicative of a widespread credential harvesting operation, which
could imply that markopolo acts as an initial access broker (IAB) or “log vendor” on a dark web
shop, such as Russian Market or 2easy Shop; however, we have no evidence to make that
assessment, as of this writing.
Threat Analysis
Vortax is a self-proclaimed virtual meeting software — marketed as a cross-platform and in-browser
enterprise-focused alternative to other video chat services — that leverages artificial intelligence to
generate meeting summaries and action items and suggest questions or comments with its
“MeetingGPT” product. Vortax is indexed by all major search engines and is primarily active on social
media (@VortaxSpace), but also maintains a Medium blog (medium[.]com/@vortax) with approximately
22 suspected AI-generated articles published between December 7, 2023, and December 16, 2023.
Vortax claims to operate out of a physical office (1100 King Street West, Toronto, Ontario, Canada),
which is actually the physical address of an apartment building. Vortax claims to have received awards
from technology publications (such as Forbes) and boasts endorsements from Fortune 500 companies
2

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS
(such as Uber), but there is no evidence to corroborate such claims. At first glance, Vortax appears to
be a legitimate software company; however, upon deeper investigation, every aspect of its “brand” is
misleading. This includes its official websites — vortax[.]io and the now-suspended vortax[.]space —
which are rife with spelling and grammatical errors (for example, “Comming Soon”).
Vortax perpetuates the spread of infostealer malware via phishing on social media. While Vortax
advertises applications for Windows, Linux, macOS, iOS, and Android on its website, users cannot
actually download said applications without a “Room ID”. Room IDs function as meeting invitations and
are spread in targeted replies and direct messages (DMs) sent from social media accounts likely
controlled by Vortax’s threat actors. These replies and DMs are in response to cryptocurrency-related
topics, which implies that a primary goal of this campaign is cryptocurrency theft.

Accounts associated with Vortax have four primary methods for sharing Room IDs, which lead to
infostealer infections:
●
Replies to the Vortax account on social media
●
Direct messages on social media
●
Posting in cryptocurrency-related Telegram channels
●
Posting in cryptocurrency-themed Discord channels
There is overlap in naming, profile pictures, content, and shared Room IDs between the accounts that
reply to the Vortax social media account and those active on other sources, indicating that these
accounts are likely connected and operated by Vortax’s operators.

The most common Room IDs identified by Insikt Group were R12307012, R39264552, R87103129, and
R71231209. All of the Room IDs, when entered into the Vortax website, redirect the user to a Dropbox
link (Windows) or external website (plumbonwater[.]com) (macOS) that downloads the Vortax installer.
Upon entering the Room ID, if one of the above codes is entered incorrectly, or is invalid, the following
response occurs:
●
The page runs a PHP script located at “hxxps://vortax[.]io/assets/php-back/check-code.php”

According to Recorded Future Malware Intelligence, behavioral analysis of the Vortax installers on
Windows and macOS indicates that Vortax App Setup.exe and VortaxSetup.dmg deliver
Rhadamanthys and Stealc, or AMOS, respectively (Table 2). As seen in Figure 5, the Vortax installer on
Windows and macOS never actually launches the purported Vortax application, claiming that it
encounters critical errors that impede it from running; however, in the background, Vortax is running
many malicious processes.

After installing Vortax, the Windows version of the application communicates with
showpiecekennelmating[.]com before connecting to a likely C2 server — 89.105.198[.]134. This IP
address hosts casino-legrand[.]info, which resolves to a FASTPANEL administrative panel login, as of
May 3, 2024. This panel is likely controlled by markopolo. The macOS version of Vortax communicates
with 193.233.132[.]137, which is likely an AMOS C2. While the AMOS C2 is based in Moscow, Russia, it
uses a different hosting provider (SUNHOST-AS, GB; AS216319) than observed in previous AMOS
campaigns (SERVER4-AS, RU; AS210352). We assess that AMOS’s operators may have moved on from
primarily leveraging SERVER4-AS.
Using Recorded Future Malware Intelligence, Insikt Group was able to identify connections between the
AMOS build associated with Vortax and a previous AMOS campaign targeting Web3 gaming projects;
the latter is detailed in the public Insikt Group report “Cybercriminal Campaign Spreads Infostealers,
Highlighting Risks to Web3 Gaming”. The BuildIDs associated with two of the fraudulent Web3 projects
in the previous campaign, Astration (astration) and Dustfighter (dust), are associated with the user
“markopolo”. This user is attributed to the BuildID of Vortax (vor) (Figure 6).

Further investigation of the Vortax staging domain plumbonwater[.]com (Table 3) revealed 23
additional domains hosted on the same IP address (79.137.197[.]159). Using Recorded Future Malware
Intelligence, Insikt Group identified that each of these domains hosts a malicious application that
delivers AMOS. Investigation into these malicious applications unearthed additional scams — similar to
Vortax, described above — that masquerade as legitimate companies and leverage social media and
messaging platforms to target cryptocurrency users. These scams, such as VDeck and Mindspeak,
share crossover with the Vortax brand and are likely operated by the same threat actor — markopolo.
Investigation into the UserIDs associated with each AMOS build identified in this network shows that all
of them are affiliated with the markopolo user, identified in previous Insikt Group investigations and
shown in Figure 6.
Table 4 provides a complete list of malicious applications, their file names and BuildIDs, and links to
Recorded Future Malware Intelligence. None of the domains below have been previously reported.

Analysis of the above domains also unearthed additional infrastructure associated with AMOS. Many of
the above AMOS builds make POST /joinsystem requests to previously unreported AMOS C2s,

Mitigations
●
Ensure that your organization-wide detections for AMOS are regularly updated and tested,
based on the IoCs linked in Appendix A, to prevent infections related to this campaign. AMOS
has gone through several development cycles since its inception and requires defenders to
regularly update signatures associated with its various versions and builds.
●
Advise users on the risks associated with downloading third-party virtual meeting software, like
Vortax, that is not approved by your organization. Consider implementing strict security controls
to prevent users from downloading unlicensed “open-source” or “freemium” software that they
may have seen on social media, messaging platforms, or search engines.
●
Encourage users to report suspicious activity on social media, messaging platforms, email, and
other mediums that engage in the behavior described in this report. Educate your users on risks
associated with cryptocurrency theft and how scams proliferate on social media.
●
Recorded Future clients can use Recorded Future Malware Intelligence to identify and mitigate
the threats identified in this report. Recorded Future Malware Intelligence will provide behavioral
analysis of malicious macOS applications that may uncover connections to AMOS C2
infrastructure.
●
Recorded Future Malware Intelligence, paired with Recorded Future Network Intelligence, can
help identify malicious domains and IP addresses that host, stage, or communicate with the
various builds of AMOS identified above.
●
As this campaign’s primary focus was on impersonating enterprise-level software, it is important
to monitor your own technology stack via the curation of bespoke tech stack watch lists in the
Recorded Future Intelligence Cloud. Leveraging these lists, in tandem with the Recorded Future
Threat Map, Recorded Future Vulnerability Intelligence, and Recorded Future Attack Surface
Intelligence, will provide unparalleled visibility into infostealer threats that may affect your
organization.
●
As the primary focus of this report was on infostealer malware, we also recommend exploring
Recorded Future Identity Intelligence and Recorded Future Brand Intelligence, which will provide
affected organizations with visibility into credentials found in AMOS infostealer logs, database
breaches, and combo lists that may result from credential compromises related to this campaign.
●
Stay abreast of developments related to AMOS in open sources (such as vendor reporting and
social media, among others), dark web and special-access sources, and messaging platforms by
using Recorded Future Threat Intelligence, Recorded Future AI, and the Recorded Future
Advanced Query Builder (AQB).
Outlook
The expansive nature of this campaign, illuminated by examining a single scam on social media
(Vortax), demonstrates the wide-ranging nature of infostealer campaigns and the difficulty of tracking
them. We assess that the indicators in this report will provide further avenues for research into the
markopolo user, the behavior of AMOS, and the patterns employed by AMOS operators to commit
scams at scale.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS
​This campaign, paired with the Web3 campaign previously described, may serve as a model for other
cybercriminals seeking to proliferate macOS malware widely. In particular, the use of generative AI to
create the appearance of a legitimate company will likely continue to be a tactic, making this social
engineering tactic more effective. We assess that, given the increase in macOS malware and exploit kits
advertised on the dark web over the past two years, the techniques described in this report will
become more widely employed by others seeking to exploit macOS, which has remained relatively
resilient to malware, compared to Windows. Organizations must consider macOS as no longer “safe”
from malware, contrary to popular perception, and therefore must factor this into their risk posture,
technology stack, and passive defenses.
