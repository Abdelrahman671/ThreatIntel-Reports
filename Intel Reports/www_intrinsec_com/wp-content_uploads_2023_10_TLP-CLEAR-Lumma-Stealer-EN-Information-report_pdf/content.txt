Key findings 
Lumma Stealer, also known as LummaC2 Stealer, is a malware-as-a-service sold through Telegram and 
Russian-speaking cybercrime forums. In this report, the following will be addressed: 
• 
The presence of Lumma in Russian-speaking forums and Telegram.  
• 
Code analysis of different campaigns distributing Lumma stealer using various techniques. 
• 
The infrastructure associated with Lumma stealer, including the old and new versions of C2 
panels.  
• 
A trail, that we uncovered, which indicates a potential use of Lumma by a Russian intrusion 
set. 
Introduction 
Lumma is an information stealer written in C/C++ language that has been observed in the wild since at 
least August 2022, while the first Lumma sample was seen on Malware Bazaar on December 20, 2022. 
The user “Lumma” started to advertise the stealer on Russian-speaking forums by the end of 2022 and 
a Telegram channel with around 1 700 subscribers as of September 2023 was also created to advertise 
it. Additionally, a website currently offline where users could buy the stealer for a price ranging 
between $250 to $1000 was also promoted. 
The stealer is believed to have been developed by the threat actor "Shamel", who goes by the alias 
"Lumma". This malware is designed to pilfer sensitive data from infected devices. Among the data 
targeted are cryptocurrency wallets, browser extensions, two-factor authentication codes, logins and 
passwords stored on browsers, and various files. Once the targeted data is obtained, it is exfiltrated to 
a C2 server and either sold privately or on various marketplaces such as Russian Market. The developer 
of the malware has consistently introduced improved iterations of its payload since its first public 
release, including a loader module. The malware was usually deployed through fake installers of 
cracked software. On September 27, the researcher ExecuteMalware shared on Github a list of IoCs 
related to a SocGholish infection delivering the Lumma stealer. This incident makes Lumma a very 
credible threat, as SocGholish is the loader associated with EvilCorp.

I - Strategical Intelligence 
1. Victimology 
Lumma logs were first observed in Russian Market in April 2023, gaining a higher share of the total logs 
in this marketplace since then, with 50% of all logs put for sale in the last 3 months, and 20% year to 
date. Around 410 000 Lumma logs were put for sale on Russian Market.  
 
 
Figure 1 : Graph displaying the percentage of logs sold on Russian Market per Stealer for the last 3 months.  
2. Attribution 
The user “Lumma” (also known as “Shamel”) employs primarily Russian as the speaking language and 
regularly stated that he does not want to speak in English. Various Telegram channels are associated 
to Lumma. The main one, “@LummaC2Stealer” is the one with most subscribers and is used to 
advertise the stealers’ updates and various information, including advertisement for other tools. The 
admin of this channel is “@lummaseller126”, who is mentionned as the account to contact to buy the 
stealer. There is also a chat group named “LummaC2Team”, with around 800 members, mainly for 
users to ask questions. Finally, the channel “LummaC2Blacklist”, with 31 subscribers, is used to expose 
scammers trying to pass as resellers of Lumma. 
Using the Telegram channel analysis tool Chatkeeper, we can get an overview of the reputations of 
users of the group chat “LummaC2Team”. The user “sv1nka_dev” is the most upvoted user. Viewing 
his messages on the channel, he acts like a secondary admin, redirecting users to the seller and the 
“real” admin and shows a real knowledge of how the channel is set up. He is also a member of the 
channels “Ransom Team | chat”, “Crypt Service | Услуги Крипта” and “Stealer Developers”. While 
this user may not be associated to Lumma’s development, since he stated in a message that he was 
not a “lumma coder”, his knowledge and popularity among this channel makes him a threat actor of 
interest who may develop tools or collaborate in already existing or future cybercrime operations.

On the dedicated thread for Lumma on XSS, where the seller/coder announces the updates, there is a 
user with the alias “dark_dream” who presents himself as a member of the developers of LC2 (Lumma 
C2) and who also participated in developing the “Morpher”. The Morpher would be the tool/code 
responsible for obfuscation. According to the user “Lumma”, the Morpher has the following 
capabilities:  
- 
Create clones of original code blocks, that are mixed with garbage code. Branches of 
conditional transitions lead to them, leading to dead code. 
- 
Original code is mixed with garbage that does not disturb the main code. If the garbage is 
removed, the code will not work. 
- 
Constants are replaced by various arithmetic expressions that compute these constants in a 
random, multi-step fashion. 
- 
The transitions and branching are broken down into additional conditional transitions that 
include jumps to random garbage code blocks that can be executed or not. 
- 
Garbage block can have jumps to other garbage block as well as the original code. 
- 
Several passes are added for obfuscation and new passes break the signature. 
- 
The Morpher is fully automated and allows to remorph at will, creating unique builds each 
time.

According to “dark_dream”, the team spent 2-3 years to develop this tool. A reverse engineer under 
the alias “waahoo” published an analysis of the Morpher on XSS. While the result does not give us any 
new insights about the Morpher, “dark dream” is seen praising the work of the reverser. Indeed, he 
mentions that the Morpher has “two main objectives”: complicate reverse work and evade 
antiviruses. Moreover, “dark_dream” says that he will soon “write an article” about his Morpher as an 
introduction for beginners. 
2.1 Is Lumma C2 only used by cybercriminals? 
In this analysis, we found that several Lumma C2 panel’s IP addresses belong to “Stark Industries 
Solutions Ltd”. Two of these IP, 45.8.146[.]213 and 45.8.146[.]227 (and their respective domains 
stateinfospace[.]com and oneinformationcrypto[.]com) are mentioned in a report by RecordedFuture 
as infrastructure related to the Russia-nexus group BlueCharlie (aka Callisto, SEABORGIUM). This 
intrusion set was previously observed in various credentials harvesting campaigns, using phishing 
websites with fake forms and login pages. While this information does not show a direct link between 
Lumma and BlueCharlie, as Stark Industries may have reattributed some IP addresses, the interest in 
credentials shown by this intrusion set might explain the choice of using a stealer. RecordedFuture’s 
report indicates that the intrusion set registered a wave of domains, including those mentioned above, 
around March 2023, which is consistent with when the domains associated to these IPs were 
registered. According to Fofa, these domains/IPs were associated with a Lumma C2 panel since at least 
end of May 2023, as the file “Doberman.min.js” was found inside it at that time, so only two/three 
months after them being potentially registered by BlueCharlie. This is also confirmed by some urlscans 
dating from May 7 2023, exposing the Lumma C2 panel login page. As the RecordedFuture report was 
published in August 2023, we cannot suspect that they had to change the ownership of these IPs so 
quickly.  
As such we can state, with a low confidence, the hypothesis that BlueCharlie uses, used, or planned to 
use Lumma Stealer for some of its operations, which is further supported by the fact that these IPs 
have not registered a domain rotation since March 2023. It is important to note that this link can also 
be based on an error from RecordedFuture, as these domains’ attribution to BlueCharlie is solely based 
on the naming pattern, the use of specific registrar, and a precise convention for the domain’s 
certificate.

Figure 3 : https://www.virustotal.com/gui/ip-address/45.8.146.213/relations. 
Recently, we observed a trend with Russian intrusion sets potentially relying more on cybercrime tools 
for their operations. In our report from July 2023 (“UAC-0006, a hybrid SmokeLoader campaign?”), we 
discussed a large SmokeLoader phishing campaign against Ukrainian entities that may be linked to the 
Russian intrusion set UAC-0006, and in July 2022, RecordedFuture revealed that UAC-0113, an 
intrusion set which could be linked to Sandworm, has been using HTML smuggling to deploy two 
malwares sold and used by cybercriminals, Colibri Loader and Warzone RAT. If this trend continues, as 
it is advantageous and cheaper for intrusion sets to use already developed sophisticated malware, it 
might prove to be more difficult to separate activities related to the Russian cybercrime ecosystem 
and Russian intrusion sets. Analysing the goals and victimology of campaigns leveraging cybercrime 
tools might be useful to discriminate between state-sponsored activities and financially oriented ones.

II - Tactical Intelligence 
1. Tactics, Techniques and Procedures 
1.1 HTML smuggling campaign operated by botnet ID “PrTi07—test2” 
This campaign distributed HTML files dubbed “Business Licence#60674.html”, “Balance 
Sheet#37553.html”, 
“Employee 
Contract_14212.html” 
and 
“Request 
for 
Proposal 
(RFP)#51982.html”. All four delivering ISO disks with the same names. 
 
Figure 4 : Content of the HTML file.  
Inside the ISO can be found 3 files in “hidden mode” : an EXE application, a PNG, and a Batch script. 
The only visible file is a shortcut with an icon of a picture.

2. Code Analysis 
As described by eSentire in their blog post, the code is highly obfuscated using Control Flow Flattening 
(CFF), which makes reversing highly time consuming. This is probably what the developer talked about 
while mentioning the “morpher”. In addition, it contains over 1200 functions. 
 
Figure 9: Heavily obfuscated function with CFF. 
The function above shows how the obfuscation works with lots of non-useful loops and conditions. 
The graph view of the full function can help illustrate how the morpher obfuscates. The added control 
flow hides the actual meaningful instructions. 
 
Figure 10: Graph view of an CFF obfuscated function. 
This function is actually a network test, with the malware trying to connect to the first C&C server from 
the list in the configuration located in the .rdata section.

The function above shows the connection attempt to the first C&C domain, returns it if successful and 
moves to the second one if it failed. 
We were able to locate the configuration containing bot id and C&C from the .rdata section:

We located what may be a screenshotting functionality using GetDC, BitBlt and CreateCompatibleDC 
windows APIs.

In addition to CFF, Lumma uses multiple and different ciphers such as this simple XOR cipher to 
obfuscate strings.

We found some interesting calculations such as square root, trigonometry, and angle conversion. We 
were not able to determine the purpose of these calculations, but we can assume that they may be 
used to add obfuscation layers.

3. Infrastructure Analysis 
3.1 Old version of Lumma stealer 
The communications with the C2 server rely on GET and POST requests using the User-Agent 
“TeslaBrowser/5.5”. The C2 endpoints are: 
• 
/c2conf for retrieving the C2 configuration (GET request) 
• 
/c2sock for data exfiltration (POST request) 
• 
/login for access to the C2 panel 
As some threat actors still run older versions of the stealer/panel, we were able to find a c2conf 
inside a Lumma panel:

Using a tool found on GitHub, we could decode the encrypted configuration. It contained 492 lines of 
JSON data:

Using the filename “doberman.min.js” which is found at this URL of Lumma panels 
“*/core/panel/js/doberman.min.js”, we can identify 29 other Lumma C2 panels: 
 
Figure 20 - Search results on Urlscan.io for the filename “doberman.min.js”. 
As the filename is mentioned in the HTML “ <head>” section in this format: “<script 
src="/core/panel/js/doberman.min.js"></script>”, searching for it in online services search engine 
gives us respectively 19 and 12 additional C2. Once sorted, we obtain 41 unique Lumma C2 servers. 
Five of them were active during the investigation. They all had the same configuration we already 
decrypted earlier.  
3.2 New version of Lumma stealer 
In the latest version of Lumma stealer, communications with the C2 server no longer rely on GET 
requests, but only on POST requests1. The former endpoints were also replaced by a unique one 
(“/api”) accepting different parameters: 
• 
act=recive_message for retrieving the C2 configuration  
• 
act=send_message for data exfiltration 
The payload must also send three other parameters to get the configuration data: 
• 
lid (meaning “Lumma ID”) 
• 
j (Victim ID ??) 
• 
ver= (Potentially the Lumma version number)

We also noticed the absence of the file “doberman.min.js” on new Lumma C2 panel, while the file 
“dober.css”, also found on older version of the panel, is still there and that the html title has changed 
from “Вход“ (meaning login) to “Lumma | Вход“. Searching for this html title on Shodan gives us 
additional C2 :

2. Recommendations 
• 
Cookie-stealing malware incidents should be tackled seriously. Accounts should be reset, and 
browser caches should also be cleared. 
• 
Consider a proactive employee’s credential assessment (logs, session cookies, login/pass 
etc.) on prioritized Dark web forums by CTI teams to mitigate the risk of account takeover. 
• 
Block indicators of compromise included in the IoCs section of this report.
