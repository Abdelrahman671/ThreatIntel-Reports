#BREAKING #Sandworm continues attacks in Ukraine 
. #ESETresearch found an evolution of a malware 
loader used during the #Industroyer2 attacks. This 
updated piece of the puzzle is malware 
 calls #ArguePatch. ArguePatch was used

The #Industroyer2 attacks used a patched version of 
 IDA 
Pro’s remote debug server (win32_remote.exe). It was modified to include 
code to decrypt and run #CaddyWiper from an external file. 2/6

This time, #Sandworm chose an official 
 executable to hide 
#ArguePatch. It was stripped of its digital signature and code was 
overwritten in a function called during the MSVC runtime initialization. 3/6

The added code is very similar in both cases, but it now includes a feature 
to launch the next stage at a particular time. This makes #ArguePatch a 
timed bomb when started. 4/6

This replaces the need to setup a Windows scheduled task for future 
detonation. This is perhaps a way to evade detections using known TTPs.
