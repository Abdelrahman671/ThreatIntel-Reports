Security Announcements
2022/09/13
An instrusion to the FishPig.co.uk extension license system was detected, causing a small piece of
malicious PHP code to be injected pre-obfuscation into the Helper/License.php file. This file is included in
most FishPig extensions so it is best to assume that all paid FishPig Magento 2 modules have been
infected.
The malicious code has been removed and steps put in place to prevent this from re-occuring.
The earliest date this has been found is currently August 6th, 2022.
Is my site affected?
The easiest way to determine if the FishPig extensions on your site have been infected is to run the
following command from the Magento root directory:
php <(curl -Ls https://fishpig.co.uk/rekoobe-sh)
This command will test any installed FishPig modules and report if an infection is present and make
recommendations on what to do.
My Site is Infected - What Now?
If you are infected or just want to take precautions, you must now either reinstall the FishPig modules or
upgrade to the latest versions. If you're using Composer then this is really easy to do. Choose from one
of the options below. If you have installed manually (eg. in app/code/FishPig), just delete the extensions
from that folder, download fresh copies and then upload them.
After doing this, it is important to restart your server to remove the backdoor from memory. This will
completely remove any trace of the backdoor from your system.
Reinstall FishPig Extensions (Keep Versions)
rm -rf vendor/fishpig && composer clear-cache && composer install --no-cache
Upgrade FishPig Extensions
rm -rf vendor/fishpig && composer clear-cache && composer update fishpig/* --
no-cache
Remove Backdoor File
2/2
The backdoor will be removed from your system automatically when you restart your server, as long as
you have already cleaned all FishPig extensions (see above).
Automated Testing Tool
This has been made even simpler and can be run against any Magento installation using the following
one liner from the Magento root directory:
php <(curl -Ls https://fishpig.co.uk/rekoobe-sh)
This tool checks all installed FishPig extensions for infection and provides advice on what to do next if
your system is not clean.
