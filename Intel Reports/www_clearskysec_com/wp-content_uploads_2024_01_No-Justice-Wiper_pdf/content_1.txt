“Homeland Justice” targets Albanian organizations with wiper 
Executive Summary 
On December 24th, 2023, Iranian psychological operation group “Homeland Justice” posted a video in 
Albanian to its Telegram channel, saying it is again destroying “terrorist supporters”. This group has 
been operating since July 2022, focusing on ransomware and destructive campaigns targeting Albania. 
On the next day, the actor announced on its Telegram channel and official site that it has breached, 
completely took over, and wiped the following Albanian infrastructure and government organizations’ 
computing systems and websites: 
One.al  – ONE Albania – an Albanian telecom company.  
EagleMobile.al  – 
Eagle Mobile Albania, an Albanian telecom company that had merged with 
ALBtelecom, that in turn had merged with OneAlbania on March 2023. The domain redirects 
to One.al.  
AirAlbania.com.al  – Air Albania, Albanian airlines.  
Parlament.al
 –
 
the Albanian parliament, following the publication of an image showing 
Albanian parliament members together with Mariam Rajavi, president of Mojahedin-e Khalq.  
The present campaign runs under hashtag #DestroyDurresMilitaryCamp (DDMC). Durrës is an Albanian 
city located on the Adriatic coast and hosting Iranian dissidents belonging to the Mojahedin-e Khalq 
opposition organization.  
ClearSky estimates that this Iranian destruction (wiping) campaign may threaten other countries.  
A video posted by the threat actor featured segments of PowerShell code used to target the Albanian 
parliament. ClearSky detected a PowerShell file matching the displayed code segments completely, 
including a matching reference to a file named NACL[.]exe. 
The PowerShell and executable files were detected compressed together in a ZIP archive uploaded 
from Albania. This unique PowerShell file was also detected compressed in a different ZIP archive, 
uploaded from Albania by the same user, alongside the publicly available Plink (previously used by 
Iranian threat actors), W2K Res Kit, and RevSocks tools. Thus, ClearSky estimates that the additional 
tools were used in the current attack with medium confidence. 
This blog post will elaborate on the group’s background and provide an in-depth analysis of the tools 
used in the current attack, including reverse engineering the NACL executable – dubbed 
 “No-Justice Wiper”.

“Homeland Justice” Group Background 
On September 23rd, 2022, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Cybersecurity and 
Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) jointly released an advisory analyzing a wave of cyber-attacks 
targeting the Government of Albania. The group, identifying as 'HomeLand Justice,' was attributed as 
an Iranian state threat actor1. 
Homeland Justice launched its first campaign on July 15th, 2022, targeting Albanian e-government 
systems right before a planned conference of Iranian opposition group Mojahedin-e Khalq (Persian: 
قلخ ِنیدهاجم), also known as MEK - a well-known Iranian group seeking to replace the current regime in 
Iran. The conference was cancelled following the attack. In September 2022, the actor launched a 
second campaign targeting Albanian border crossings. On December 24th, 2023, the actor publicized 
the current campaign, described in this blog, targeting Albanian infrastructure and government 
organizations. It is interesting to note that an MEK camp was raided by police in June 2023: 
 
 
The actor’s logo is not randomly designed. It uses the logo of threat actor PredatorySparrow (Persian 
Gonjeshk-e Darrande هدنرد کشجنگ), whose last attack, on December 18th, 2023, targeted Iranian fuel 
infrastructure. The group previously claimed attacks on Iranian steel factories. Homeland Justice’s 
logo depicts an eagle attacking a bird identical to the one on PredatorySparrow’s logo, confined in a 
Star of David:

The group logo was presented alongside the text: “why should our taxes be spent on terrorists of 
Durres?”: 
 
Durres is the second most populous city of the Republic of Albania, and the “terrorists” the group refers 
to are the mentioned MEK group (Mujahedin-e Khalq) residing there. 
On November 20th, 2023, leading up to the current attack, Homeland Justice posted using their 
telegram channel, stating that they are back due to “widespread corruption in or country” (typing error 
on their part):

Technical Analysis of the Tools Used in the Campaign 
During our research, we detected two main tools used in the campaign – the wiper and the 
PowerShell. We assume both files were deployed simultaneously, the PowerShell intended to copy 
and propagate the wiper to other machines in the organizational network prior to its activation. 
While investigating the posts made by “Homeland Justice”, we noticed the use of a PowerShell named 
“p”, referring to an executable named “NACL”:

The next screenshot shows the pdb path created when compiling the file. It is apparent that the folder 
name is loweraser – a suitable name for a wiper (eraser) file: 
 
 
It is worth noting that in the first Homeland Justice attack, the No-Justice wiper had a valid digital 
signature by “Kuwait Telecommunications Company KSC”, indicating a consistent method to give 
files an appearance of legitimacy. 
Dynamic Analysis 
During ClearSky’s dynamic analysis in a laboratory environment, the file crashed the station on which 
it ran (bluescreen) and manipulated the operating system so that it won’t load when attempting to 
turn the machine on. It should be noted that the file requires elevated (admin) privileges to wipe the 
computer.

Reverse Engineering 
The screenshot on the next page shows the file’s main function. The function is relatively simple and 
small. ClearSky’s team used Ida Pro to analyze the malware code.   
 
The file’s main function 
The next screenshot shows the file’s main function written in pseudo code, that provides a more 
comprehensible presentation of the malware’s functionality. The malware performs several actions

while running, including loading a library, receiving addresses for API functions, and ultimately wiping 
the computer.  
 
The file’s main function written in pseudo code 
 
Main function explained in detail: 
• 
Initially, we may observe a call for function LoadLibraryW, that loads DLL file kernel32.dll 
while running. The function returns a handle for the loaded library. The handle is saved in 
register ebx.  
• 
Following these steps, the function GetProcAddress is called, returning the address of the 
function DeviceIoControl.  
• 
Function GetProcAddress is called again, this time returning the address of function 
CreateFileW.  
• 
At this point function sub_D10C0 is called (calling vswprintf_s). Below is a screenshot of the 
function: 
 
 
o The function receives several arguments, including buffer, format and arglist. 
o The function sets the buffer in accordance with the received format and arglist and 
returns the buffer length.  
  
 
12 | P a g e  
© 2024 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd. 
o The function enters the value of arglist (the letter C) into the buffer in the received 
format (\\\\.\\%c:) and returns its length (6).  
o Following is an image with the buffer value.  
 
 
• 
Then the function CreateFileW is called. It returns a handle for the device received in the buffer 
(\\.\C:). (The other parameters indicate privileges and specific access permissions). 
• 
At this point the function GetProcAddress is called. It returns the offset of function CloseHandle 
(in kernel32.dll module). The handle received from calling CreateFileW is checked for validity. 
This check ensures that the user has elevated privileges.  
• 
If they do, function DeciveIoControl is called, with the handle for the device and control code 
0x7c100, that removes the boot signature from the Master Boot Record, so the disk would be 
formatted from sector zero to the end of the disk. The partition details are not stored in sector 
zero anymore (which would crash the operating system and prevent rebooting). Then the 
handle closes and the function ends.  
• 
If they do not, the function ends.  
 
The following screenshot shows an explanation of the control code (0x7c100) that the function 
DeviceIoControl receives as a parameter.  
 
The wiper’s primary actions: 
1. Sets a string of the device name to be acted upon (\\.\C:) by function sub_D10C0. 
2. Creates a handle for the device with the function CreateFileW. 
3. Calls the function DeviceIoControl with the handle for the device and control code 0x7c100 
and removes the boot signature from the Master Boot Record, so the disk is formatted from 
sector zero to the end of the disk.  
4. Crashes the operating system in a way that it cannot be rebooted.

Beginning of main function.  
Calling function LoadLibraryW that loads kernel32.dll 
while running. The function returns a handle for the 
loaded library. 
The address of function GetProcAddress is saved in 
edi (calling edi is calling function GetProcAddress). 
The handle to library kernel32.dll is saved in ebx. 
Calling function GetProcAddress with parameters – 
handle for library kernel32.dll and “DeviceIoControl" 
- returns the address of function DeviceIoControl. 
Calling function GetProcAddress with parameters 
– handle for library kernel32.dll and "CreateFileW" 
- returns the address of function CreateFileW. 
The address of function DeviceIoControl is saved 
in [ebp+var_210]. 
Calling function sub_D10C0 with parameters – ‘C’, 
Format, and Buffer - returns the buffer length.  
The address of function CreateFileW is saved in esi.

Function sub_D10C0. 
Calling function stdio_common_vswprintf_s with 
parameters ArgList, Locale, Format, BufferCount, 
and Buffer.  
The function enters the value of arglist (the letter 
“C”) into buffer (in the received format (\\\\.\\%c:) 
and returns its length (6). 
Calling esi (function CreateFileW) with 
parameters – lpFileName, dwDesiredAccess, 
dwShareMode, lpSecurityAttributes, 
dwCreationDisposition, 
dwFlagsAndAttributes, hTemplateFileFile - 
returns the handle for the device received in 
buffer (\\.\C:). 
The other parameters indicate privileges and 
specific access permissions. 
Calling function GetProcAddress with parameters 
- handle for library kernel32.dll and 
"CloseHandle” - returns the address of function 
CloseHandle saved in edi. 
The received handle is checked for validity. 
Calling [ebp+var_210] (function 
DeviceIoControl) with parameters - 
handle for the device and control code 
0x7c100. 
The function removes the boot 
signature from the Master Boot Record, 
so the disk is formatted from sector zero 
to the end of the disk. The partition 
details are no longer stored in sector 
zero (which crashes the operating 
system with no possibility of rebooting 
again). 
Finally, edi (CloseHandle) is called with 
the buffer (device name). 
Finally, a call is made to the function 
stored in EDI (CloseHandle), using the 
buffer (device name) as a parameter. 
End of main function

Accompanying Files 
PowerShell Analysis 
Parameters: 
$TargetsFile: Path of a file containing target machine names. 
$SourcePath: Path of the file to be pushed. 
$DestPath: Path of the file on the target machine. 
$Argument: Argument for the executable file (optional). 
$Action: Copy or run. "Copy" only copies the executable; "run" copies and executes it (default: copy). 
$Mode: Two modes - "normal" or "force". "Normal" tries to connect to machines with WinRM 
enabled, while "force" attempts to enable WinRM on target machines (default: normal). 
$UserName & $Password: Credentials for connecting to target machines. If not provided, it tries to 
connect using the current access. 
Functions: 
TestConnection: Checks if a machine is reachable. 
TestWSManEnabled: Tests if WinRM is enabled on a machine. 
TryToEnableWinRM: Attempts to enable WinRM on a target machine. 
CreateSession: Creates a PowerShell session for a target machine. 
ActionOnOpenMachine: Copies and optionally executes a file on a target machine. 
Run-parallel: Runs PowerShell scripts in parallel on multiple machines. 
Script Execution: 
Reads a list of target machines from a file ($TargetsFile). 
For each machine, it checks its online status and WinRM state. 
Depending on the WinRM state, it either runs a parallel script (Run-parallel) to copy and execute the 
file or attempts to enable WinRM on the target machine before doing so. 
If the machine is not available or offline, the computer name is written to a file called $machine[.]txt 
with the following text message: 
 
It appears that the file $machine[.]txt is used as a diagnostic log.  
We assess that the PowerShell runs from the DC server using admin privileges, as indicated from the 
code: 
 
The PowerShell file p[.]ps1 was not present on VirusTotal at the time of the discovery.

Utilities Analysis 
The user that uploaded the wiper NACL[.]exe to VirusTotal from Albania also uploaded files: 
staging[.]exe – a version of the tool RevSocks, 1[.]exe - a version of the tool Plink, and local[.]exe - a 
version of the tool W2K Res Kit. All four files were uploaded in a timeframe of one and a half hours: 
 
 
 
 
 
Since these tools were uploaded to VirusTotal by the same user that uploaded the wiper in a short 
timeframe, we attribute them with medium confidence to the same threat actor, and we estimate that 
they were used by Homeland Justice in its attack. Another contributing factor for this estimation was 
the detection of a ZIP archive named tools[.]zip, uploaded to a threat intelligence platform a day after 
the previously mentioned zip[.]zip archive. This second ZIP archive contained the unique p[.]ps1 file, 
the staging[.]exe RevSocks file, the 1[.]exe Plink file, and the local[.]exe W2K Res Kit tool file: 
  
 
17 | P a g e

1[.]exe - Plink 
"Plink" is a command-line tool commonly associated with the PuTTY suite, which is a collection of 
software utilities for network communication. Specifically, "plink.exe" is a component of PuTTY that 
serves as a command-line interface to connect to remote systems using the SSH (Secure Shell) 
protocol. 
This tool was used by several Iranian threat actors in past attacks for lateral movement purposes. 
Staging[.]exe – RevSocks 
RevSocks is a tool that enables threat actors to establish a connection with a server via SOCKS proxy. 
This can be employed by attackers for data exfiltration, command and control, or for maintaining 
persistent access in a compromised network. 
local[.]exe - W2K Res Kit tool 
A  tool that would enumerate local admins on all network computers.
