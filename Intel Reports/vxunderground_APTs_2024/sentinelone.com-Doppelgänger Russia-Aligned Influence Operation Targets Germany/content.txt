Doppelgänger | Russia-Aligned Influence Operation Targets
Germany
Aleksandar Milenkoski ⋮
Executive Summary
SentinelLabs and ClearSky Cyber Security have been tracking the activities of a suspected Russia-aligned
influence operation network named Doppelgänger.
We observed Doppelgänger intensively targeting German audiences, coinciding with recent reports from the
German Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Der Spiegel.
The network spreads propaganda and disinformation through news articles focused on current socio-economic
and geopolitical topics relevant to the general population.
Doppelgänger disseminates content criticizing the ruling government coalition and its support for Ukraine, likely
aiming to influence public opinion before the upcoming elections in Germany.
Doppelgänger leverages a substantial network of X accounts, actively participating in coordinated activities to
enhance visibility and engage audiences.
Overview
SentinelLabs and ClearSky Cyber Security have been tracking a propaganda and disinformation campaign since late
November 2023, highly likely orchestrated by Doppelgänger, a suspected Russia-aligned influence operation network
known for its persistent and aggressive tactics. Initially focusing on disseminating anti-Ukraine content following the
onset of the Russo-Ukrainian conflict, Doppelgänger has since broadened its scope, targeting audiences in the US,
Israel, Germany, and France.
We observed a significant emphasis by Doppelgänger on targeting German audiences. The network’s activities are
characterized by consistent efforts to disseminate propaganda and disinformation content, particularly by exploiting
current topics of geopolitical and socio-economic significance among the population. The majority of the content
seizes every opportunity to criticize the ruling government coalition and its support for Ukraine.
With Doppelgänger activities intensifying in times of frequent political shifts in Germany, we suspect that the network’s
goal is to erode support for the coalition in light of upcoming European Parliament, municipal, and federal state
elections, culminating in federal government elections scheduled for 2025.
While we were documenting the Doppelgänger campaign, the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the prominent
German media outlet Der Spiegel reported on overlapping activities, highlighting a growing concern about election
interference.
In this post, we supplement existing reporting by providing additional technical indicators and insights into
Doppelgänger’s tactics and disseminated content, with the ultimate goal of further heightening public awareness of
this threat.
This report focuses on Doppelgänger activities targeting German audiences; a complementary report by Clearsky
Cyber Security delves into the network’s targeting of Israel, the United States, and Ukraine. The activities we
observed closely resemble and partially overlap with those previously reported by Recorded Future and Meta,
indicating the persistent nature of Doppelgänger.
We observed Doppelgänger orchestrating the operation of a large coordinated network of X (formerly known as
Twitter) accounts. These accounts propagate content from third-party websites whose content aligns with
Doppelgänger propaganda goals, as well as from sites that Doppelgänger itself has created.
The majority of the X accounts we discovered as part of our investigation had not been deactivated at the time of
writing. In an effort to maximize visibility and audience engagement, these accounts participate in coordinated
activities, such as regularly posting and reposting content from highly popular profiles, as well as engaging with posts
from other suspected Doppelgänger-managed accounts.
The posts from these accounts contain links that redirect visitors through two stages to the destination articles
intended for consumption. These stages implement obfuscation and tracking techniques. Coupled with the carefully
constructed infrastructure management practices we observed Doppelgänger implementing, this underscores the
network’s determination to operate without interruptions while effectively tracking the performance of its influence
operations.
Redirection Stages
2/12
The first-stage websites, which Doppelgänger distributes on X, use thumbnail images hosted at telegra[.]ph to
obfuscate the website thumbnails and redirect to second-stage sites.
First-stage website
The second-stage websites contain text unrelated to the campaign and execute a JavaScript code obfuscated using
Base64-encoding.
Second-stage website
The JavaScript code samples we analyzed issue a request to ggspace[.]space (reported as part of previous
Doppelgaenger campaigns) or sdgqaef[.]site. The request includes tracking information, which is likely a
campaign identifier. These are in the format of [country]-[day]-[month]_[domain], where [domain] refers to
the domain hosting the destination article (DE-02-01_deintelligenz for an article hosted at
deintelligenz[.]com). The IOC table at the end of this post lists some of the campaign identifiers we observed.
Second-stage website: Deobfuscated JavaScript code
In addition, the JavaScript code executed by second-stage websites dynamically loads another JavaScript code
provided by ggspace[.]space or sdgqaef[.]site, which implements logic for generating web content that
redirects to a destination article.
3/12
JavaScript code from sdgqaef[.]site
sdgqaef[.]site and ggspace[.]space host at the /admin URL path a login page, which has been assessed to
be of the Keitaro Tracking System. Doppelgaenger possibly uses Keitaro to track the effectiveness of its campaigns.

Social Media Activities
Probably in an attempt to increase their visibility, some of the suspected Doppelgänger-managed X accounts we
identified regularly post content, which does not necessarily contain first-stage websites, whereas others remain idle
for relatively long time periods.
An active and idle suspected Doppelgänger account
We observed accounts posting content linking to first-stage sites in multiple languages of the targeted audiences.
Further, the Doppelgänger’s account network is probably attempting to increase the engagement metrics of posts that
link to first-stage websites in a targeted manner through reposts and views. This becomes evident when these
metrics are compared with the metrics of posts by the same accounts that do not link to first-stage websites.

Multi-language posts tailored to the targeted audiences
Engagement metric discrepancies
We identified multiple clusters of suspected Doppelgänger-managed accounts which have joined the X platform
within the same month. We observed a significant level of coordination in the activities of the accounts within the
same cluster, suggesting centralized control. This includes reposting of the same content at almost the same time,
typically that of highly popular profiles. In addition, engagement metrics of posts that link to first-stage sites by
suspected Doppelgänger accounts within the same cluster often have very similar engagement metrics.

Our analysis of the engagement metrics for almost all the accounts we identified revealed a range of reposts between
700 and 2000, with a median value of 883, and a range of views between 613 and 14000, with a median value of
5000.
Propaganda and Disinformation Content
Doppelgänger has been very active in creating websites that host articles for consumption by targeted audiences
through the previously described multi-stage approach. Among these sites, there are domains and websites
impersonating third-party news outlets, which includes mimicking their design, structure, and domain names, such as
welt[.]pm (inauthentic) vs. welt[.]de (authentic) and faz[.]ltd (inauthentic) vs. faz[.]net (authentic). We
assess that the rest of the websites we observed have been created by Doppelgänger with original design and
structure and no indications of impersonating established news platforms.
In most cases, we observed consistent and regular publishing of new content, with only occasional idle periods
lasting a few days at most. Some of the content consists of a blend of materials sourced from other websites and
translated into the languages of the targeted audiences.
A closer look at the custom-built websites indicates that Doppelgänger has been making a fast-paced effort to bring
its websites online and start distributing content. For example, some sites include template text or exhibit errors in
search functionalities. Furthermore, nearly all of these websites lack social media presence. They display icons of
social media platforms that link to the domains of these platforms rather than specific profiles.
Template text (emphasis added)
Many of the custom-built websites have been built and are managed using the WordPress content management
system. We observed that some websites display status messages in Russian when users perform content searches
and the activity fails with an error, indicating the use of Russian-language WordPress components.
WordPress status message translates to “Search for”
The majority of the articles Doppelgänger distributes have a strong anti-government narrative, especially in regard to
the government’s support of Ukraine. The article snippets we present below are machine-translated from German into
English.
An article at arbeitspause[.]org discusses a recent series of strikes by workers in the German public transport
demanding better wages and better working conditions. The challenges relating to the state of workers in this sector,
such as rising living costs due to inflation and shortage of workers, are a pressing concern in Germany that captures
the attention of the broader population.
7/12
Article snippet from arbeitspause[.]org, referencing Scholz, the German chancellor (emphasis added)
On a similar note, another article at arbeitspause[.]org focuses on the recent strikes by German farmers, which
involved the blockade of major roads and were motivated by rising living costs and the government’s plan to phase
out agricultural subsidies. Overlapping at times with the strikes in the public transport sectors, the farmers’ strikes
have been disrupting mobility and therefore garnered the attention of the population and mass media. Doppelgänger
has attempted to capitalize on the momentum by criticizing the government’s plan regarding agricultural subsidies,
drawing a connection to the government’s support for Ukraine.
Article snippet from arbeitspause[.]org
An article at derglaube[.]com focuses on the German immigration policy, which, according to some polls, ranks
among the top issues for voters in Germany. In addition, the media frequently covers topics relating to the
government’s allocation of funds for immigration-related programs and services. Consistent with typical
Doppelgänger practices, the influence operation network uses this opportunity to cast the government in a negative
light and introduce its support for Ukraine into the narrative.

Article snippet from derglaube[.]com (emphasis added)
In an attempt to blend political-oriented propaganda or disinformation among other topics, some websites host
articles covering broader subjects such as health, sports, and culture. We observed attempts to introduce
propaganda even in such articles. For example, an article hosted at miastagebuch[.]com initially discusses
headaches from a medical perspective only to later indicate the German government as one of the major causes of
headaches.
8/12
Anti-government statements in a health-themed article (emphasis added)
We emphasize that Doppelgänger also targets Germany through articles published by third-party outlets, such as
telepolis[.]de, freiewelt[.]net, overton-magazin[.]de, and deutschlandkurier[.]de.
The articles from these outlets that Doppelgänger disseminates focus on both domestic and international topics,
some with a strong anti-Western narrative. For instance, an article from overton-magazin[.]de portrays the West
as profiteering from the Russo-Ukrainian conflict, while depicting Ukraine as a plaything of Western global players
(cit.).
Article snippet from overton-magazin[.]de (emphasis added)
Additionally, an article from osthessen-news[.]de highlights factors such as the Ukraine war and inflation as
contributors to economic challenges in Germany, prompting medium-sized companies to consider restructuring due
to escalating costs. Issues concerning small- and mid-sized companies are particularly relevant to the broader
German audience, given their significant contribution to the country’s overall economy.

Infrastructure
The Doppelgänger infrastructure can be structured into four parts subject to different infrastructure management and
control practices, with each part designated to hosting the different entities involved in disseminating content for
consumption by targeted audiences: the first-stage and second-stage redirection websites, the servers likely used for
monitoring campaign performance (ggspace[.]space and sdgqaef[.]site), and the destination websites.
The first-stage and second-stage websites often shift between a variety of hosting providers, such as Hostinger,
Global Internet Solutions, and Digital Ocean. The domains of these websites typically have short lifespans, lasting
only several days at a time and recurring multiple times over a few years. We observe that Doppelgänger activates
the domains for brief periods during its campaigns before deactivating them again.
The domains of the first-stage websites have a diverse range of top-level domains (TLDs), including generic TLDs
such as .buzz, .art, .store, .site, and .online, as well as country code TLDs like .co.uk and .br. The
domains’ format suggests an automated generation approach involving the creation of subdomains and numerical
suffixes, for example, pcrrjx.kredit-money-fun169[.]buzz and yzrhhk.kredit-money-fun202[.]buzz.
This strategy, combined with the frequent rotation between hosting providers and the cyclical nature of the domains,
indicates an effort by Doppelgänger to evade detection and tracking of its first-stage infrastructure, which is exposed
on social media platforms and therefore more likely to be subjected to scrutiny. Doppelgänger does not apply the
same domain naming convention to second-stage websites, which are not directly exposed on social media
platforms.
Playing a central role in Doppelgänger’s campaigns, ggspace[.]space and sdgqaef[.]site are responsible for
both redirection and presumably monitoring campaign performance. They are hosted behind a Cloud-based reverse
proxy infrastructure, likely implemented as a security measure to obfuscate their true hosting locations. In contrast to
the first-stage and second-stage domains, the active periods of these domains typically span several months during
Doppelgänger’s campaigns.
Many of the servers hosting the destination websites are managed using cPanel, and some implement geofencing,
which restricts traffic to IP addresses from targeted countries. This practice is likely intended to minimize exposure of
their infrastructure and content to scrutiny and monitoring by researchers or authorities outside those regions,
reducing the likelihood of detection and investigation into Doppelgänger’s activities.
The domains of the majority of these websites were first registered in the first quarter of 2023 and some as early as
mid-2022, remaining active as of the time of writing. A smaller subset of domains, such as derglaube[.]com,
which we assess with high confidence as being managed by Doppelgänger at this time, have been active for nearly
10 years, with intermittent periods of inactivity lasting a few years at most.
Conclusions
Doppelgänger represents an active instrument of information warfare, characterized by strategic use of propaganda
and disinformation to influence public opinion. The campaign targeting Germany we discussed in this post serves as
a compelling example of the persistent and continually evolving nature of Russia-aligned influence operations, which
exploit social media and current topics of geopolitical and socio-economic significance to shape perceptions.
We anticipate that Doppelgänger’s activities, targeting not only Germany but also other Western countries, will persist
and evolve, particularly in light of the major elections scheduled across the EU and the USA in the coming years. We
expect Doppelgänger to continue innovating its infrastructure and obfuscation tactics to make its activities more
difficult to detect and disrupt.
We emphasize that countering influence operations requires a comprehensive and collaborative approach, involving
enhancing public awareness and media literacy to identify and resist manipulation, alongside prompt and effective
actions by social media platforms and infrastructure operators to limit the spread of propaganda and disinformation
online.
SentinelLabs continues to monitor Doppelgänger activities and remains committed to timely reporting on its
operations to improve public awareness of this threat and mitigate its impact.
Indicators of Compromise
Due to the extensive volume of observed indicators, we present here only a selection, including indicators from
parallel campaigns targeting France alongside those targeting German audiences.
