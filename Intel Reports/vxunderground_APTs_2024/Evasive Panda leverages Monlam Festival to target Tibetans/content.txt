Evasive Panda leverages Monlam Festival to target Tibetans
ESET researchers discovered a cyberespionage campaign that, since at least September 2023, has been
victimizing Tibetans through a targeted watering hole (also known as a strategic web compromise), and a
supply-chain compromise to deliver trojanized installers of Tibetan language translation software. The
attackers aimed to deploy malicious downloaders for Windows and macOS to compromise website
visitors with MgBot and a backdoor that, to the best of our knowledge, has not been publicly documented
yet; we have named it Nightdoor.
Key points in this blogpost:
• We discovered a cyberespionage campaign that leverages the Monlam Festival – a
religious gathering – to target Tibetans in several countries and territories.
• The attackers compromised the website of the organizer of the annual festival, which
takes place in India, and added malicious code to create a watering-hole attack
targeting users connecting from speciﬁc networks.
• We also discovered that a software developer’s supply chain was compromised and
trojanized installers for Windows and macOS were served to users.
• The attackers ﬁelded a number of malicious downloaders and full-featured backdoors
for the operation, including a publicly undocumented backdoor for Windows that we
have named Nightdoor.
• We attribute this campaign with high conﬁdence to the China-aligned Evasive Panda
APT group.
Evasive Panda proﬁle
Evasive Panda (also known as BRONZE HIGHLAND and Daggerﬂy) is a Chinese-speaking APT group,
active since at least 2012. ESET Research has observed the group conducting cyberespionage against
individuals in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macao, and Nigeria. Government entities were targeted in
Southeast and East Asia, speciﬁcally China, Macao, Myanmar, The Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam.
Other organizations in China and Hong Kong were also targeted. According to public reports, the group
has also targeted unknown entities in Hong Kong, India, and Malaysia.
The group uses its own custom malware framework with a modular architecture that allows its backdoor,
known as MgBot, to receive modules to spy on its victims and enhance its capabilities. Since 2020 we
have also observed that Evasive Panda has capabilities to deliver its backdoors via adversary-in-the-
middle attacks hijacking updates of legitimate software.
Campaign overview
In January 2024, we discovered a cyberespionage operation in which attackers compromised at least
three websites to carry out watering-hole attacks as well as a supply-chain compromise of a Tibetan
software company.
The compromised website abused as a watering hole belongs to Kagyu International Monlam Trust, an
organization based in India that promotes Tibetan Buddhism internationally. The attackers placed a script
in the website that veriﬁes the IP address of the potential victim and if it is within one of the targeted
ranges of addresses, shows a fake error page to entice the user to download a “ﬁx” named certiﬁcate
(with a .exe extension if the visitor is using Windows or .pkg if macOS). This ﬁle is a malicious downloader
that deploys the next stage in the compromise chain.
Based on the IP address ranges the code checks for, we discovered that the attackers targeted users in
India, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Australia, and the United States; the attack might have aimed to capitalize on
international interest in the Kagyu Monlam Festival (Figure 1) that is held annually in January in the city of
Bodhgaya, India.
Figure 1. Kagyu Monlam’s website with the dates of the festival
Interestingly, the network of the Georgia Institute of Technology (also known as Georgia Tech) in the
United States is among the identiﬁed entities in the targeted IP address ranges. In the past,the university
was mentioned in connection with the Chinese Communist Party’s inﬂuence on education institutes in the
US.
Around September 2023, the attackers compromised the website of a software development company
based in India that produces Tibetan language translation software. The attackers placed several
trojanized applications there that deploy a malicious downloader for Windows or macOS.
In addition to this, the attackers also abused the same website and a Tibetan news website called
Tibetpost – tibetpost[.]net – to host the payloads obtained by the malicious downloads, including two full-
featured backdoors for Windows and an unknown number of payloads for macOS.
Figure 2. Timeline of events related to the attack
With high conﬁdence we attribute this campaign to the Evasive Panda APT group, based on the malware
that was used: MgBot and Nightdoor. In the past, we have seen both backdoors deployed together, in an
unrelated attack against a religious organization in Taiwan, in which they also shared the same C&C
server. Both points also apply to the campaign described in this blogpost.
Watering hole
On January 14th, 2024, we detected a suspicious script at https://www.kagyumonlam[.]org/media/vendor/
jquery/js/jquery.js?3.6.3.
Malicious obfuscated code was appended to a legitimate jQuery JavaScript library script, as seen in
Figure 2.
Figure 3. The malicious code added at the end of a jQuery library
The script sends an HTTP request to the localhost address http://localhost:63403/?
callback=handleCallback to check whether the attacker’s intermediate downloader is already running on
the potential victim machine (see Figure 3). On a previously compromised machine, the implant replies
with handleCallback({"success":true }) (see Figure 4) and no further actions are taken by the script.
Figure 4. The JavaScript code that checks in with the implant
Figure 5. The implant answering the JavaScript check-in request
If the machine does not reply with the expected data, the malicious code continues by obtaining an MD5
hash from a secondary server at https://update.devicebug[.]com/getVersion.php. Then the hash is
checked against a list of 74 hash values, as seen in Figure 6.
Figure 6. An array of hashes stored in the malicious JavaScript
If there is a match, the script will render an HTML page with a fake crash notiﬁcation (Figure 7) intended
to bait the visiting user into downloading a solution to ﬁx the problem. The page mimics typical “Aw,
Snap!” warnings from Google Chrome.
Figure 7. A fake graphic rendered by the JavaScript
The “Immediate Fix” button triggers a script that downloads a payload based on the user’s operating
system (Figure 8).
Figure 8. Download URLs for Windows and macOS
Breaking the hash
The condition for payload delivery requires getting the correct hash from the server at
update.devicebug[.]com, so the 74 hashes are the key to the attacker’s victim selection mechanism.
However, since the hash is computed on the server side, it posed a challenge for us to know what data is
used to compute it.
We experimented with diﬀerent IP addresses and system conﬁgurations and narrowed down the input for
the MD5 algorithm to a formula of the ﬁrst three octets of the user’s IP address. In other words, by
inputting IP addresses sharing the same network preﬁx, for example 192.168.0.1 and 192.168.0.50, will
receive the same MD5 hash from the C&C server.
However, an unknown combination of characters, or a salt, is included with the string of ﬁrst three IP
octets before hashing to prevent the hashes from being trivially brute-forced. Therefore, we needed to
brute-force the salt to secure the input formula and only then generate hashes using the entire range of
IPv4 addresses to ﬁnd the matching 74 hashes.
Sometimes the stars do align, and we ﬁgured out that the salt was 1qaz0okm!@#. With all pieces of the
MD5 input formula (for example, 192.168.1.1qaz0okm!@#), we brute-forced the 74 hashes with ease and
generated a list of targets. See the Appendix for a complete list.
As shown in Figure 9, the majority of targeted IP address ranges are in India, followed by Taiwan,
Australia, the United States, and Hong Kong. Note that most of the Tibetan diaspora lives in India.
Figure 9. Geolocation of targeted IP address ranges
Windows payload
On Windows, victims of the attack are served with a malicious executable located at https://
update.devicebug[.]com/ﬁxTools/certiﬁcate.exe. Figure 10 shows the execution chain that follows when
the user downloads and executes the malicious ﬁx.
Figure 10. Loading chain of certiﬁcate.exe
certiﬁcate.exe is a dropper that deploys a side-loading chain to load an intermediate downloader,
memmgrset.dll (internally named http_dy.dll). This DLL fetches a JSON ﬁle from the C&C server at
https://update.devicebug[.]com/assets_ﬁles/conﬁg.json, which contains the information to download the
next stage (see Figure 11).
Figure 11. Content of conﬁg.json
When the next stage is downloaded and executed, it deploys another side-loading chain to deliver
Nightdoor as the ﬁnal payload. An analysis of Nightdoor is provided below in the Nightdoor section.
macOS payload
The macOS malware is the same downloader that we document in more detail in Supply-chain
compromise. However, this one drops an additional Mach-O executable, which listens on TCP port
63403. Its only purpose is to reply with handleCallback({"success":true }) to the malicious JavaScript code
request, so if the user visits the watering-hole website again, the JavaScript code will not attempt to re-
compromise the visitor.
This downloader obtains the JSON ﬁle from the server and downloads the next stage, just like the
Windows version previously described.
Supply-chain compromise
On January 18th, we discovered that the oﬃcial website (Figure 12) of a Tibetan language translation
software product for multiple platforms was hosting ZIP packages containing trojanized installers for
legitimate software that deployed malicious downloaders for Windows and macOS.
Figure 12. Windows and macOS applications are backdoored versions, hosted on the legitimate website’s d
We found one victim from Japan who downloaded one of the packages for Windows. Table 1 lists the
URLs and the dropped implants.

Figure 13 illustrates the loading chain of the trojanized application from the package monlam-bodyig3.zip.
Figure 13. Loading chain of the malicious components
The trojanized application contains a malicious dropper called autorun.exe that deploys two components:
• an executable ﬁle named MonlamUpdate.exe, which is a software component from an emulator
called C64 Forever and is abused for DLL side-loading, and
• RPHost.dll, the side-loaded DLL, which is a malicious downloader for the next stage.
When the downloader DLL is loaded in memory, it creates a scheduled task named Demovale intended to
be executed every time a user logs on. However, since the task does not specify a ﬁle to execute, it fails
to establish persistence.
Next, this DLL gets a UUID and the operating system version to create a custom User-Agent and sends a
GET request to https://www.monlamit[.]com/sites/default/ﬁles/softwares/updateFiles/
Monlam_Grand_Tibetan_Dictionary_2018/UpdateInfo.dat to obtain a JSON ﬁle containing the URL to
download and execute a payload that it drops to the %TEMP% directory. We were unable to obtain a
sample of the JSON object data from the compromised website; therefore we don’t know from where
exactly default_ico.exe is downloaded, as illustrated in Figure 13.
Via ESET telemetry, we noticed that the illegitimate MonlamUpdate.exe process downloaded and
executed on diﬀerent occasions at least four malicious ﬁles to %TEMP%\default_ico.exe. Table 2 lists
those ﬁles and their purpose.

Finally, the default_ico.exe downloader or dropper will either obtain the payload from the server or drop it,
then execute it on the victim machine, installing either Nightdoor (see the Nightdoor section) or MgBot
(see our previous analysis).
The two remaining trojanized packages are very similar, deploying the same malicious downloader DLL
side-loaded by the legitimate executable.
macOS packages
The ZIP archive downloaded from the oﬃcial app store contains a modiﬁed installer package (.pkg ﬁle),
where a Mach-O executable and a post-installation script were added. The post-installation script copies
the Mach-O ﬁle to $HOME/Library/Containers/CalendarFocusEXT/ and proceeds to install a Launch
Agent in $HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/com.Terminal.us.plist for persistence. Figure 14 shows the script
responsible for installing and launching the malicious Launch Agent.
Figure 14. Post-installation script for installing and launching the malicious Launch Agent
The malicious Mach-O, Monlam-bodyig_Keyboard_2017 in Figure 13 is signed, but not notarized, using a
developer certiﬁcate (not a certiﬁcate type usually used for distribution) with the name and team identiﬁer
ya ni yang (2289F6V4BN). The timestamp in the signature shows that it was signed January 7th, 2024.
This date is also used in the modiﬁed timestamp of the malicious ﬁles in the metadata of the ZIP archive.
The certiﬁcate was issued only three days before. The full certiﬁcate is available in the IoCs section. Our
team reached out to Apple on January 25th and the certiﬁcate was revoked the same day.
This ﬁrst-stage malware downloads a JSON ﬁle that contains the URL to the next stage. The architecture
(ARM or Intel), macOS version, and hardware UUID (an identiﬁer unique to each Mac) are reported in the
User-Agent HTTP request header. The same URL as the Windows version is used to retrieve that
conﬁguration: https://www.monlamit[.]com/sites/default/ﬁles/softwares/updateFiles/
Monlam_Grand_Tibetan_Dictionary_2018/UpdateInfo.dat. However, the macOS version will look at the
data under the mac key of the JSON object instead of the win key.
The object under the mac key should contain the following:
• url: The URL to the next stage.
• md5: MD5 sum of the payload.
• vernow: A list of hardware UUIDs. If present, the payload will only be installed on Macs that have
one of the listed hardware UUIDs. This check is skipped if the list is empty or missing.
• version: A numerical value that must be higher than the previously downloaded second stage
“version”. The payload is not downloaded otherwise. The value of the currently running version is
kept in the application user defaults.
After the malware downloads the ﬁle from the speciﬁed URL using curl, the ﬁle is hashed using MD5 and
compared to the hexadecimal digest under the md5 key. If it matches, its extended attributes are removed
(to clear the com.apple.quarantine attribute), the ﬁle is moved to $HOME/Library/SafariBrowser/
Safari.app/Contents/MacOS/SafariBrower, and is launched using execvp with the argument run.
Unlike the Windows version, we could not ﬁnd any of the later stages of the macOS variant. One JSON
conﬁguration contained an MD5 hash (3C5739C25A9B85E82E0969EE94062F40), but the URL ﬁeld was
empty.
Nightdoor
The backdoor that we have named Nightdoor (and is named NetMM by the malware authors according to
PDB paths) is a late addition to Evasive Panda’s toolset. Our earliest knowledge of Nightdoor goes back
to 2020, when Evasive Panda deployed it onto a machine of a high-proﬁle target in Vietnam. The
backdoor communicates with its C&C server via UDP or the Google Drive API. The Nightdoor implant
from this campaign used the latter. It encrypts a Google API OAuth 2.0 token within the data section and
uses the token to access the attacker’s Google Drive. We have requested that the Google account
associated with this token be taken down.
First, Nightdoor creates a folder in Google Drive containing the victim’s MAC address, which also acts as
a victim ID. This folder will contain all the messages between the implant and the C&C server. Each
message between Nightdoor and the C&C server is structured as a ﬁle and separated into ﬁlename and
ﬁle data, as depicted in Figure 15.
Figure 15. The conversation messages between the implant and the
C&C from the victim’s folder in the attacker’s Google Drive
Each ﬁlename contains eight main attributes, which is demonstrated in the example below.
Example:
1_2_0C64C2BAEF534C8E9058797BCD783DE5_168_0_1_4116_0_00-00-00-00-00-00
• 1_2: magic value.
• 0C64C2BAEF534C8E9058797BCD783DE5: header of pbuf data structure.
• 168: size of the message object or ﬁle size in bytes.
• 0: ﬁlename, which is always the default of 0 (null).
• 1: command type, hardcoded to 1 or 0 depending on the sample.
• 4116: command ID.
• 0: quality of service (QoS).
• 00-00-00-00-00-00: meant to be MAC address of the destination but always defaults to
00-00-00-00-00-00.
The data inside each ﬁle represents the controller’s command for the backdoor and the necessary
parameters to execute it. Figure 16 shows an example of a C&C server message stored as ﬁle data.
Figure 16. Message from the C&C server
By reverse engineering Nightdoor, we were able to understand the meaning of the important ﬁelds
presented in the ﬁle, as shown in Figure 17.
Figure 17. Nightdoor command ﬁle format
We found that many meaningful changes were added to the Nightdoor version used in this campaign, one
of them being the organization of command IDs. In previous versions, each command ID was assigned to
a handler function one by one, as shown in Figure 18. The numbering choices, such as from 0x2001 to
0x2006, from 0x2201 to 0x2203, from 0x4001 to 0x4003, and from 0x7001 to 0x7005, suggested that
commands were divided into groups with similar functionalities.
Figure 18. Nightdoor’s old method of assigning command IDs to handling functions
However, in this version, Nightdoor uses a branch table to organize all the command IDs with their
corresponding handlers. The command IDs are continuous throughout and act as indexes to their
corresponding handlers in the branch table, as shown in Figure 19.

command IDs as well as the equivalent IDs from older versions.

Conclusion
We have analyzed a campaign by the China-aligned APT Evasive Panda that targeted Tibetans in several
countries and territories. We believe that the attackers capitalized, at the time, on the upcoming Monlam
festival in January and February of 2024 to compromise users when they visited the festival’s website-
turned-watering-hole. In addition, the attackers compromised the supply chain of a software developer of
Tibetan language translation apps.
The attackers ﬁelded several downloaders, droppers, and backdoors, including MgBot – which is used
exclusively by Evasive Panda – and Nightdoor: the latest major addition to the group’s toolkit and which
has been used to target several networks in East Asia.
A comprehensive list of Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) and samples can be found in our GitHub
repository.
