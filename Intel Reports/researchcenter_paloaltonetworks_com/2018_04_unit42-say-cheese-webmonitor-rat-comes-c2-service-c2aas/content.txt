We noticed that while detection was high for most anti-virus vendors, all tagged it with only generic detection. At this point we realized that although this malware had been around for almost a year, we were looking at a hitherto-undocumented commodity RAT.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nFor Sale\r\nCommodity RATs are typically peddled on underground forums and come and go with new offerings springing up to replace those taken down by law enforcement actions.\r\n\r\nFigure 1 \u2013 WebMonitor RAT Forum sales thread\r\n&nbsp;\r\nWe first observed apparent tests of this RAT in late February 2017. In May 2017, \u201cRevcode\u201d advertises his RAT \u201cWebMonitor\u201d at hackforums[.]net (Figure 1) for \u20ac14.99 - \u20ac29.99 (Figure 2):\r\n\u201c[#1 Web RAT, CONTROL FROM WEB BROWSER, No PORTFORWARD, KEYLOGGER, + VPN]\u201d.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFigure 2 \u2013 Editions of WebMonitor RAT sold at three different pricepoints.\r\nIn addition to forum sales thread, Revcode\u2019s main sales and support site is at revcode[.] eu (Figure 3).\r\n\r\nFigure 3 \u2013 Screenshot of revcode[.]eu advertising WebMonitor\r\nFeatures\r\nOn the server-side, WebMonitor offers an included VPN and C2 service (discussed in detail later in this report), with a web-based interface (Figure 4).\r\n\r\nFigure 4 - Web-based C2 interface\r\nWebMonitor offers two interface options: the original \u201cLite\u201d version, and a slicker interface in the \u201cEnterprise\u201d version.\r\nA list of features is provided at the site, some of which stretch the guise of a legitimate administration tool:\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n \tApplications\r\n\r\n \tApp crash log\r\n \tInjected DLLs list\r\n \tInstalled codes list\r\n \tLoaded DLLs list\r\n \tOverview\r\n\r\n\r\n \tBluetooth\r\n\r\n \tBluetooth log view\r\n \tBluetooth view\r\n\r\n\r\n \tBrowser\r\n\r\n \tAddons list\r\n \tHistory\r\n \tImage cache\r\n\r\n\r\n \tCredentials\r\n\r\n \tBrowser\r\n\r\n \tPasswords\r\n\r\n\r\n \tMail\r\n\r\n \tAll clients\r\n\r\n\r\n \tMessenger live\r\n\r\n \tAll clients\r\n\r\n\r\n \tNetwork\r\n\r\n \tNet pass\r\n \tWifi key view\r\n\r\n\r\n \tSystem\r\n\r\n \tKeys\r\n\r\n\r\n \tFilesystem\r\n\r\n \tDisk smart view\r\n \tFile browser\r\n \tRecent files list\r\n\r\n\r\n \tForensics\r\n\r\n \tHarddrive operations\r\n \tPhysical RAM dump\r\n\r\n\r\n \tKeyboard\r\n\r\n \tHarddrive operations\r\n \tPhysical RAM dump\r\n\r\n\r\n \tMessengers\r\n\r\n \tHarddrive operations\r\n \tPhysical RAM dump\r\n\r\n\r\n \tMonitor\r\n\r\n \tHarddrive operations\r\n \tPhysical RAM dump\r\n\r\n\r\n \tNetworking\r\n\r\n \tNet route view\r\n \tTCP analyze\r\n \tURL protocol view\r\n \tUser profiles view\r\n \tWiFi info\r\n \tWiFi channel monitor\r\n \tWiFi history\r\n \tWireless networks\r\n \tWireless watcher\r\n\r\n\r\n \tRuntime\r\n\r\n \tBlue screen log\r\n \tTurned on times\r\n\r\n\r\n \tSystem\r\n\r\n \tBattery info\r\n \tConnections\r\n \tDevice manager\r\n \tDrivers\r\n \tFirmtables\r\n \tHardware manager\r\n \tInformation\r\n \tInternal activity\r\n \tMUI cache\r\n \tProcess manager\r\n \tRemote registry\r\n \tRemote shell\r\n \tSecurity software list\r\n \tServices\r\n \tStartup view\r\n \tWin logon activity\r\n \tWindows list\r\n \tWindows update list\r\n\r\n\r\n \tWebcam\r\n\r\n \tSnapshot\r\n \tStream Webcam\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA recent development, in January Revcode partner \u201cSoftpatch\u201d offers an Android RAT client, posting the source code at Github.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nWebMonitor Client\r\nThe WebMonitor client (ie: the RAT) is written in Visual Basic 6 (VB6) and packed with UPX.\r\nIt installs to\u00a0users\\%USERNAME%\\AppData\\Roaming\\REVCODE-***.EXE,\r\nwhere **** is a random 4-digit hex value.\r\nFor persistence it creates a registry key under\r\nx86:\u00a0HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\u00a0\r\nx64: HKCUU\\Software\\Wow6432Node\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run) (Figure 5), similarly appending using the same 4-digit value.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFigure 5 - Persistence registry key\r\nAlong with the C2-as-a-Service, the client builder is designed for ease of use, with a focus on simplicity. Along with deciding whether a pop-up is displayed \u2013 or not \u2013 the customer can decide whether the client should run at startup, and if the process should restart if terminated (Figure 6).\r\n\r\nFigure 6 - Client Builder Interface\r\nRevcode partner (or alternative forum account) attempts to claim legitimacy \u201cWe have to follow the laws and therefore have to display installation dialogs. However, we can't help if people bypass that by cracking or patching the executable.\u201d But then contradicts himself in fact, with the builder option to NOT create an installation pop-up, and \u201cThe reason why me made it possible in a way to bypass the dialog is when customers want to update their clients. We don't find it necessary to reproduce the installation dialogs.\u201d.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nC2aaS\r\nAs previously seen in Quaverse RAT \/ QRAT, WebMonitor offers Command-and-Control (C2)-as-a-Service (C2aas). Customers don\u2019t have to (in fact, can\u2019t) run their own C2 system, it\u2019s provided for them. WebMonitor C2s to virtual-hostnames, apparently unique to each customer, at one of two root C2 domains. Although C2 communication is over HTTPS, an obvious downside to such a C2 domain architecture is that the C2 traffic is easily detected and blocked based upon the domains.\r\nWebMonitor customers access their C2 web interface via user-specific virtual hostnames at the host C2s (Figure 7).\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFigure 7 - C2 Virtual Hosts\r\nThe original C2 domain was the same as the sales website, revcode[.]eu. In late July 2017, a second root-C2 was brought online, wm01[.]to (\u201cWebMonitor\u201d).\r\n&nbsp;\r\nDNS &amp; Coin Mining\r\nStarting in samples first observed late-November 2017, in addition to DNS lookups for the C2 as described above, the RAT clients also performed multiple lookups for non-existent domains (Figure 8).\r\n\r\nFigure 8 - NXD and Monero Mining Pool DNS lookups\r\nThese take the form &lt;username&gt;.&lt;8_char_hex_value&gt;.to. No domains in any observed samples using this technique actually exist, and as such the DNS \u201cNXD\u201d (non-existent domain) response has no obvious C2 function.\r\nIt is possible that this is may be a yet-to-be-implemented Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) implementation, otherwise possibly a clumsy and ineffectual effort to attempt to camouflage the genuine C2 DNS lookup among invalid ones.\r\nOne of the very first samples observed using this new technique also contacted a Monero Mining Pool server pool1.minexmr[.]com, as seen in Figure 8 above. This may have been the author testing rather than a feature released to his customers, as we only observed this once in the wild. Monero mining is hardly representative of a feature of a \u201clegitimate remote administration utility\u201d.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nRAT Customers and Targets\r\nRevcode[.]eu is observed being used less often in recent months, in favor of wm01[.]to, with some samples contacting both. At time of writing, we understand those to be the only two domains used by WebMonitor\u2019s C2-as-a-Service. Based upon analysis of passive DNS records, we observed just under 100 virtual hosts under the two domains, giving an indication of the relatively small number of customers. To date Palo Alto Networks has collected just over 500 distinct samples of WebMonitor.\r\n\r\nFigure 9 - Verticals\r\n&nbsp;\r\nThe apparently-small number of customers and the \u201ccommodity\u201d nature of this malware, with a modest price tag, might suggest an innocuous threat. However, using AutoFocus, we have observed over 2000 WebMonitor infection attempts against Palo Alto Networks customers across multiple verticals (Figure 9), worldwide (Figure 10).\r\n\r\nFigure 10 - Global distribution of targets\r\nAuthor\r\nThe domain revcode[.]eu has an in-the-clear, non-anonymized WHOIS (Figure 11). Several current and historical domains are registered with identical information, some back to 2013. Research into the information in the WHOIS found corroborating information, identifying a 25-year-old from the state of Bavaria in southern Germany.\r\n\r\nFigure 11 \u2013 en-clar revcoce[.]eu WHOIS registration\r\nInterestingly, while WebMonitor has been marketed since May 2017, there has been no other formal analysis and write-up in the year that it has been sold. The tongue-in-cheek, Florida-based blogger \u201cKrabs on Security\u201d offers an analysis, but this hasn\u2019t been picked up by mainstream malware researchers. She opines \u201ca very very legal malware backed by a .eu domain and a very very long Term of Service that was used in CEO Fraud, as seen below. Who would\u2019ve thought such legal software being advertised on the benign forums dubbed \u201cHackForums\u201d would be used for such notorious cybercriminal purposes?\u201d. \u201cRevcode\u201d partner \u201cSoftPatch\u201d seemed slighted and was quick to attack this analysis, pointing out in a forum post (Figure 12) multiple apparent inaccuracies.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFigure 12 - SoftPatch fires back at krabsonsecurity\r\nAnd Revcode himself, despite the usual attempts at pretense-of-legitimacy seen in Commodity RAT sales, markets features that have no utility for legitimate use: \u201cperfectly compatible with all crypters and protectors\u201d, \u201cPrivacy is our priority, so no logs are saved on our servers.\u201d. Revcode partner (or alternative forum account\u201d posts an exhaustive list of credentials that this RAT can recover \u201cHere is a list of what kind of credentials RevCode is capable of recovering\u201d:\r\nWeb Browsers:\r\n* Internet Explorer 4.0 - 11.0\r\n* Mozilla Firefox - All versions\r\n* Google Chrome\r\n* Safari\r\n* Opera\r\n\u00a0\r\nIM Clients:\r\n* MSN Messenger\r\n* Windows Messenger (In Windows XP)\r\n* Windows Live Messenger (In Windows XP\/Vista\/7)\r\n* Yahoo Messenger (Versions 5.x and 6.x)\r\n* Google Talk\r\n* ICQ Lite 4.x\/5.x\/2003\r\n* AOL Instant Messenger v4.6 or below, AIM 6.x, and AIM Pro\r\n* Trillian\r\n* Trillian Astra\r\n* Miranda\r\n* GAIM\/Pidgin\r\n* MySpace IM\r\n* PaltalkScene\r\n* Digsby\r\n\u00a0\r\nEmail Clients:\r\n* Outlook Express\r\n* Microsoft Outlook 2002\/2003\/2007\/2010\/2013\/2016\r\n* Windows Mail\r\n* Windows Live Mail\r\n* IncrediMail\r\n* Eudora\r\n* Netscape 6.x\/7.x (If the password is not encrypted with master password)\r\n* Mozilla Thunderbird (If the password is not encrypted with master password)\r\n* Group Mail Free\r\n* Yahoo!

Fortunately, owing to the \u201cC2aaS\u201d model employed, detection of and prevention against WebMonitor C2 traffic is trivial. Webmonitor\u2019s addition to the list of currently-marketed commodity RATs demonstrates their continued popularity, enabling successful attacks even in the hands of the unsophisticated attacker.\r\nWe predict that WebMonitor won\u2019t last much longer, at least not with this model as the C2s are too easily identified\/blocked. Indeed, another aspect of this centralized model, having the hosted service create each client for customers, might put the author\u2019s hands on every one of the malware samples in the eyes of the law.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nCoverage\r\nPalo Alto Networks customers are protected from this threat in the following ways:\r\n\r\n \tWildFire accurately identifies WebMonitor RAT samples as malicious.\r\n \tTraps prevents this threat on endpoints, based upon WildFire prevention.\r\n \tWebMonitor root C2 domains are flagged as malicious in Threat Prevention.\r\n\r\nAutoFocus users can view WebMonitor RAT samples using the \u201cWebMonitorRAT\u201d tag.\r\nIOCs can be found in the appendices of this report.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nAppendices - IOCs\r\n&nbsp;\r\nAppendix I \u2013 C2 domains\r\nrevcode[.]eu\r\nwm01[.]to\r\n&nbsp;\r\nAppendix II \u2013 Sample hashes\r\nHashes of WebMonitor samples can be found here.","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","@id":"#panworg"},"image":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https:\/\/unit42.paloaltonetworks.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/unit42-blog-600x300-300x300.jpg","width":300,"height":300},"speakable":{"@type":"SpeakableSpecification","xPath":["\/html\/head\/title","\/html\/head\/meta[@name='description']\/@content"]},"author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Mike Harbison"},{"@type":"Person","name":"Simon Conant"}]}</script><link rel='stylesheet' id='crayon-css' href='https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/plugins/crayon-syntax-highlighter/css/min/crayon.min.css?ver=_2.7.2_beta' media='all' />

We noticed that while detection was high for most anti-virus vendors, all tagged it with only generic detection. At this point we realized that although this malware had been around for almost a year, we were looking at a hitherto-undocumented commodity RAT.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-size: 18pt;">For Sale</span><br />
Commodity RATs are typically peddled on underground forums and come and go with new offerings springing up to replace those taken down by law enforcement actions.<br />

We first observed apparent tests of this RAT in late February 2017. In May 2017, “Revcode” advertises his RAT “WebMonitor” at hackforums[.]net (Figure 1) for €14.99 - €29.99 (Figure 2):<br />
“[#1 Web RAT, CONTROL FROM WEB BROWSER, No PORTFORWARD, KEYLOGGER, + VPN]”.<br />

<p>A recent development, in January Revcode partner “Softpatch” offers an Android RAT client, posting the source code at <a href="https://github.com/rev-code/AndroidClient">Github</a>.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="tab-stops: 168.6pt;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">WebMonitor Client</span></p>
<p>The WebMonitor client (ie: the RAT) is written in Visual Basic 6 (VB6) and packed with UPX.<br />
It installs to users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\REVCODE-***.EXE,<br />
where **** is a random 4-digit hex value.<br />
For persistence it creates a registry key under<br />
<strong>x86: </strong><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run </span><br />
<strong>x64:</strong> <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">HKCUU\Software\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run</span>) (Figure 5), similarly appending using the same 4-digit value.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 5 - Persistence registry key</em></p>
<p>Along with the C2-as-a-Service, the client builder is designed for ease of use, with a focus on simplicity. Along with deciding whether a pop-up is displayed – or not – the customer can decide whether the client should run at startup, and if the process should restart if terminated (Figure 6).<br />
<img  class="aligncenter wp-image-72020 lozad"  data-src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Say-Cheese_6.png" alt="Say Cheese_6" width="600" height="278" data-srcset="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Say-Cheese_6.png 974w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Say-Cheese_6-900x418.png 900w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Say-Cheese_6-300x139.png 300w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Say-Cheese_6-768x356.png 768w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Say-Cheese_6-370x172.png 370w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 6 - Client Builder Interface</em></p>
<p>Revcode partner (or alternative forum account) attempts to claim legitimacy “<em>We have to follow the laws and therefore have to display installation dialogs. However, we can't help if people bypass that by cracking or patching the executable.</em>” But then contradicts himself in fact, with the builder option to NOT create an installation pop-up, and “<em>The reason why me made it possible in a way to bypass the dialog is when customers want to update their clients. We don't find it necessary to reproduce the installation dialogs.</em>”.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-size: 18pt;">C2aaS</span><br />
As previously seen in <a href="https://www.trustwave.com/Resources/SpiderLabs-Blog/Quaverse-RAT--Remote-Access-as-a-Service/">Quaverse RAT / QRAT</a>, WebMonitor offers Command-and-Control (C2)-as-a-Service (C2aas). Customers don’t have to (in fact, can’t) run their own C2 system, it’s provided for them. WebMonitor C2s to virtual-hostnames, apparently unique to each customer, at one of two root C2 domains. Although C2 communication is over HTTPS, an obvious downside to such a C2 domain architecture is that the C2 traffic is easily detected and blocked based upon the domains.<br />
WebMonitor customers access their C2 web interface via user-specific virtual hostnames at the host C2s (Figure 7).<br />

<p>The original C2 domain was the same as the sales website, revcode[.]eu. In late July 2017, a second root-C2 was brought online, wm01[.]to (“<u>W</u>eb<u>M</u>onitor”).<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-size: 18pt;">DNS &amp; Coin Mining</span><br />
Starting in samples first observed late-November 2017, in addition to DNS lookups for the C2 as described above, the RAT clients also performed multiple lookups for non-existent domains (Figure 8).<br />
<img  class="aligncenter wp-image-71942 lozad"  data-src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Say-Cheese_8.png" alt="Say Cheese_8" width="600" height="693" data-srcset="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Say-Cheese_8.png 633w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Say-Cheese_8-260x300.png 260w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Say-Cheese_8-370x427.png 370w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 8 - NXD and Monero Mining Pool DNS lookups</em></p>
<p>These take the form &lt;username&gt;.&lt;8_char_hex_value&gt;.to. No domains in any observed samples using this technique actually exist, and as such the DNS “NXD” (non-existent domain) response has no obvious C2 function.<br />
It is possible that this is may be a yet-to-be-implemented Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) implementation, otherwise possibly a clumsy and ineffectual effort to attempt to camouflage the genuine C2 DNS lookup among invalid ones.<br />
One of the very first samples observed using this new technique also contacted a Monero Mining Pool server pool1.minexmr[.]com, as seen in Figure 8 above. This may have been the author testing rather than a feature released to his customers, as we only observed this once in the wild. Monero mining is hardly representative of a feature of a “legitimate remote administration utility”.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-size: 18pt;">RAT Customers and Targets</span><br />
Revcode[.]eu is observed being used less often in recent months, in favor of wm01[.]to, with some samples contacting both. At time of writing, we understand those to be the only two domains used by WebMonitor’s C2-as-a-Service. Based upon analysis of passive DNS records, we observed just under 100 virtual hosts under the two domains, giving an indication of the relatively small number of customers. To date Palo Alto Networks has collected just over 500 distinct samples of WebMonitor.<br />

The apparently-small number of customers and the “commodity” nature of this malware, with a modest price tag, might suggest an innocuous threat. However, using <a href="https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/secure-the-network/subscriptions/autofocus">AutoFocus</a>, we have observed over 2000 WebMonitor infection attempts against Palo Alto Networks customers across multiple verticals (Figure 9), worldwide (Figure 10).<br />

The domain revcode[.]eu has an in-the-clear, non-anonymized WHOIS (Figure 11). Several current and historical domains are registered with identical information, some back to 2013. Research into the information in the WHOIS found corroborating information, identifying a 25-year-old from the state of Bavaria in southern Germany.<br />

<p>Interestingly, while WebMonitor has been marketed since May 2017, there has been no other formal analysis and write-up in the year that it has been sold. The tongue-in-cheek, Florida-based blogger “Krabs on Security” offers an <a href="https://krabsonsecurity.com/2017/08/08/revcode-webmonitor-the-legal-malware-used-in-ceo-fraud/">analysis</a>, but this hasn’t been picked up by mainstream malware researchers. She opines “<em>a very very legal malware backed by a .eu domain and a very very long Term of Service that was used in CEO Fraud, as seen below. Who would’ve thought such legal software being advertised on the benign forums dubbed “HackForums” would be used for such notorious cybercriminal purposes?</em>”. “Revcode” partner “SoftPatch” seemed slighted and was quick to attack this analysis, pointing out in a forum post (Figure 12) multiple apparent inaccuracies.<br />

<p>And Revcode himself, despite the usual attempts at pretense-of-legitimacy seen in Commodity RAT sales, markets features that have no utility for legitimate use: “<em>perfectly compatible with all crypters and protectors</em>”, “<em>Privacy is our priority, so no logs are saved on our servers.</em>”.

<span style="font-size: 18pt;">Summary</span><br />
The feature set of this RAT would afford an attacker significant access to and control of a victim. Fortunately, owing to the “C2aaS” model employed, detection of and prevention against WebMonitor C2 traffic is trivial. Webmonitor’s addition to the list of currently-marketed commodity RATs demonstrates their continued popularity, enabling successful attacks even in the hands of the unsophisticated attacker.<br />
We predict that WebMonitor won’t last much longer, at least not with this model as the C2s are too easily identified/blocked. Indeed, another aspect of this centralized model, having the hosted service create each client for customers, might put the author’s hands on every one of the malware samples in the eyes of the law.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-size: 18pt;">Coverage</span><br />
Palo Alto Networks customers are protected from this threat in the following ways:</p>
<ol>
