Russia-nexus actor targets Ukraine
⋮ 7/24/2024
Recently an email was forwarded to Virustotal, appearing to show a ukr.net sender spoofing “Headquarters Police
Department” (Головне управління поліції), targeting a government organization related to the Ukrainian economy.
Detection takeaways:
1. the zip attachment was only 341 bytes, and the underlying attachment was even smaller at 134 bytes
2. these very small sizes may bypass filters analysts or tools use to weed out junk files

The initial HTML was very small, 134 bytes, and was simply a redirect to an external site.

The page content is the below, and one can notice that it’s a phishing page for ukr.net, a Ukrainian webmail service.
This service is a frequent target for Russia-nexus threat actors.

The doc.html page contains a numerous amount of sig-able artifacts to find similar phishing pages. Signatures need
not be written on malicious content to be effective. In the below example, the <head lang="uk"> is unusual.
lang= is typically inside a <html> tag instead of <head>, but when you can combine this with other indicators, two
weak signals can become a strong signature.

Figure 6: associated landing pages
Examining the landing pages, we can notice the credentials will be POST’d to a PHP script and then redirected.
Figure 7: Analysts raise an eyebrow at “dl8”
After the credentials are sent, the PHP script redirects us to a decoy that might be interesting to a Ukrainian target.
When analysts see “dl8.php”, they typically wonder what may live at “dl1.php”, “dl2.php”, etc.
Figure 8: decoy content after credentials are entered
After looping through dl[0-9].php, we can harvest a number of other interesting decoy files as well as IOCs.

A quick pivot to passivedns through our community account at silentpush shows many likely related domains, shared
in our github.

Lastly, pivots on the layout of the phishing page, combined with negating legitimate infrastructure, will lead to similar
phishing campaign.
