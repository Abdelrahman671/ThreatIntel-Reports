Fighting Ursa Luring Targets With Car for Sale
Unit 42 ⋮ ⋮ 8/2/2024
This post is also available in: 日本語 (Japanese)
Executive Summary
A Russian threat actor we track as Fighting Ursa advertised a car for sale as a lure to distribute HeadLace backdoor
malware. The campaign likely targeted diplomats and began as early as March 2024. Fighting Ursa (aka APT28,
Fancy Bear and Sofacy) has been associated with Russian military intelligence and classified as an advanced
persistent threat (APT) [PDF].
Diplomatic-car-for-sale phishing lure themes have been used by Russian threat actors for years. These lures tend to
resonate with diplomats and get targets to click on the malicious content.
Unit 42 has previously observed other threat groups using this tactic. For example, in 2023, a different Russian threat
group, Cloaked Ursa, repurposed an advertisement for a BMW for sale to target diplomatic missions within Ukraine.
This campaign is not directly connected to the Fighting Ursa campaign described here. However, the similarity in
tactics points to known behaviors of Fighting Ursa. The Fighting Ursa group is known for repurposing successful
tactics – even continuously exploiting known vulnerabilities for 20 months after their cover was already blown.
The details of the March 2024 campaign, which we attribute to Fighting Ursa with a medium to high level of
confidence, indicate the group targeted diplomats and relied on public and free services to host various stages of the
attack. This article examines the infection chain from the attack.
Palo Alto Networks customers are better protected from the threats discussed in this article through our Network
Security solutions, such as Advanced WildFire and Advanced URL Filtering, as well as our Cortex line of products.

Initial Lure
The URL kicking off this infection chain was hosted by a legitimate service named Webhook.site, and it was
submitted to VirusTotal on March 14, 2024. Webhook.site is a service for legitimate development projects, and it
allows its users to create randomized URLs for various purposes like custom automation based on the characteristics
of visitors to the URLs.
In this case, Fighting Ursa abused Webhook.site to craft a URL that returned a malicious HTML page. Figure 1 below
shows the HTML returned from the webhook[.]site URL.

Figure 1. HTML code used in the attack hosted on the Webhook.site service.
The HTML shown above in Figure 1 has multiple elements that attempt to automate the attack. First, it checks if the
visiting computer is Windows-based. If not, it redirects to a decoy image on a URL hosted by another legitimate
provider, which is a free service named ImgBB. As the final payload is Windows based, this operating system check
is probably an effort to ensure that further actions taken in the attack are only taken for Windows visitors. The HTML
then creates a ZIP archive from Base64 text in the HTML, offers it for download and attempts to open it with the
JavaScript click() function.
Figure 2 below shows the decoy image advertising a car for sale, specifically an Audi Q7 Quattro SUV. This fake
advertisement is titled “Diplomatic Car For Sale.”
The image provides different views of the vehicle. The image also contains contact details that are likely fake, as well
as a phone number based in Romania. Finally, the image also lists the point of contact as the Southeast European
Law Enforcement Center, possibly to lend this fake advertisement more credibility.

Downloaded Malware
The downloaded ZIP archive is saved as IMG-387470302099.zip and contains three files listed below in Table 1.

Table 1. Contents of the downloaded file IMG-387470302099.zip.
Table 1 above shows that the first file IMG-387470302099.jpg.exe has a double file extension of .jpg.exe. Windows
hosts with a default configuration hide file extensions, so the .jpg.exe file extension only shows as .jpg in the file
name. This is a common tactic used by threat actors to trick potential victims into double-clicking the file, in this case
believing it will open a car for sale advertisement.
The file named IMG-387470302099.jpg.exe is a copy of the legitimate Windows calculator file calc.exe. This file is
used to sideload the included DLL file WindowsCodecs.dll, which is a component of the HeadLace backdoor.
HeadLace is modular malware that executes in stages. This stage-based loading is probably designed to prevent
detection and minimize the malware's exposure to analysts. The DLL file contains a function shown below in Figure 3.
Figure 3. Code in WindowsCodecs.dll file to run a file named zqtxmo.bat.
This function is solely meant to execute the last file within the ZIP archive, zqtxmo.bat. Figure 4 below shows the
content of zqtxmo.bat.
4/5
Figure 4. Contents of the zqtxmo.bat batch file.
This batch file starts a process for Microsoft Edge (start msedge) to run content passed as Base64-encoded text. As
shown above in Figure 4, the decoded text is a hidden iframe that retrieves content from a different Webhook.site
URL.
The batch file saves content from this second Webhook.site URL as IMG387470302099.jpg in the user's downloads
directory. It then moves the downloaded file into the %programdata% directory and changes the file extension from
.jpg to .cmd. Finally, the batch file executes IMG387470302099.cmd, then deletes itself as a way to remove any
obvious trace of malicious activity.
Attribution
We attribute this activity with a medium to high level of confidence to Fighting Ursa based on the tactics, techniques
and procedures (TTPs), characteristics of the attack infrastructure and the malware family attackers used.
This attack relies heavily on public and free services to host lures and various stages of the attack. Documentation by
IBM, Proofpoint, Recorded Future and others reveal that while the infrastructure used by Fighting Ursa varies for
different attack campaigns, the group frequently relies on these freely available services. Furthermore, the tactics
from this campaign fit with previously documented Fighting Ursa campaigns, and the HeadLace backdoor is exclusive
to this threat actor.
Conclusion
Fighting Ursa is a motivated threat actor. The infrastructure the group uses has constantly changed and evolved, as
noted in a recent report from Recorded Future. Other industry reports have also shown various lures this actor uses
in attempts to drop HeadLace malware.
We assess that Fighting Ursa will continue to use legitimate web services in its attack infrastructure. To defend
against these attacks, defenders should limit access to these or similar hosting services as necessary. If possible,
organizations should scrutinize the use of these free services to identify possible attack vectors.
Palo Alto Networks Protection and Mitigation
Palo Alto Networks customers are better protected from the threats discussed above through the following products:
Cortex XDR detects the attack chain described above, among other protections in the Cortex XDR platform.
Cortex XSIAM and XSOAR have released a response pack and playbook for automatically detecting the
Fighting Ursa threat actor. This playbook downloads the APT28 detection rules and performs extraction,
enrichment, and tagging of indicators. It executes our generic Threat Hunting sub-playbook and subsequently
provides analysts with recommended workarounds, empowering them to decide the best course of action with
the enriched indicators.
Advanced URL Filtering identifies known URLs associated with this activity as malicious.
The Advanced WildFire machine-learning models and analysis techniques have been reviewed and updated in
light of the IoCs shared in this research.
