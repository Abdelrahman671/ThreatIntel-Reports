TLP: WHITE information may be distributed without restriction
PIPEDREAM is the seventh-known Industrial Control Systems (ICS)-specific 
malware and the fifth malware specifically developed to disrupt industrial 
processes. PIPEDREAM demonstrates significant adversary research and 
development focused on the disruption, degradation, and potentially, the 
destruction of industrial environments and physical processes. 
The Dragos-designated threat group CHERNOVITE developed 
PIPEDREAM, which consists of a collection of components. PIPEDREAM 
can impact a wide variety of Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) and 
industrial software, including specific Omron and Schneider Electric PLCs, 
and poorly configured Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture 
(OPC-UA) servers. 
One of the Schneider Electric PLCs that PIPEDREAM targets, leverages 
CODESYS as its underlying system architecture. PIPEDREAM uses CODESYS 
as a key component to abuse due to its lack of security. CODESYS is a 
third-party software component used by hundreds of industrial equipment 
vendors. While PIPEDREAM can currently identify and target PLCs from 
Omron and Schneider Electric, its tooling may be used to target and attack 
controllers from hundreds of other vendors. In sum, PIPEDREAM can target 
a variety of PLCs in multiple verticals due to its versatility.
Dragos assesses with high confidence that PIPEDREAM has not yet 
been employed for disruptive or destructive effects. This is a rare case 
of analyzing malicious capabilities before employment of effects against 
victim infrastructure, giving defenders a unique opportunity to prepare 
in advance. Dragos assesses with high confidence that this capability was 
developed by a state-sponsored adversary with the intention to leverage 
PIPEDREAM in future operations.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
WHITEPAPER
DRAGOS, INC.

TLP: WHITE information may be distributed without restriction
Based on current observations, CHERNOVITE 
focuses on manipulating industrial control 
systems and can achieve Stage 2 of the ICS 
Cyber Kill Chain. As an impact-focused team, 
CHERNOVITE would need access facilitated 
by other teams to ingress into target 
environments. 
CHERNOVITE’s observable infrastructure 
consists of compromised, adversary-controlled command-and-control 
infrastructure. Their activity is expected to shift to a malicious 
adversary-controlled domain or webserver. CHERNOVITE is likely to 
use service provider infrastructure; however, there are no indications of 
current active infrastructure. CHERNOVITE can use target infrastructure 
to facilitate interactive operations and lateral movement, access 
enablement in an operational technology (OT) environment, and the 
manipulation of processes to achieve adversary intent.

TLP: WHITE information may be distributed without restriction
Threats to industrial infrastructure security are an extremely 
sensitive matter. Given the unique realities of industrial 
operations, it is often harder for defenders to react than for 
adversaries to leverage public information. The more time the 
community has to implement mitigations before new malicious 
capabilities become public, the better the chance the adverse 
effects from any attempted attacks will be reduced.
Dragos identified and analyzed PIPEDREAM’s capabilities 
through our normal business, independent research, and 
collaboration with various partners in early 2022. Our primary 
focus is informing industrial asset owners and operators with 
as much information as possible. It is the team’s stance never 
to be first to communicate detailed technical insights on ICS 
threats and capabilities until the information is already going 
to become public; this is done as the information can often be 
weaponized and industrial control system (ICS) defenders need 
as much time as possible. Once information about threats and 
new capabilities are made public, Dragos’s approach is to follow 
up with detailed analysis and advice to the security community. 
This report was proactively written and readied for release as 
the information became public through other avenues.

KEY FINDINGS
•	 PIPEDREAM is a clear and present threat to the 
availability, control, and safety of industrial 
control systems and processes. PIPEDREAM 
can be used to endanger operations and lives.
•	 PIPEDREAM’s industrial-related components 
expose a command-line interface for 
manipulating target controllers and OPC-UA 
servers.
•	 PIPEDREAM can execute 36 MITRE ICS-
ATT&CK techniques.
•	 CHERVONITE can manipulate the speed and 
torque of Omron servo motors used in many 
industrial applications. This manipulation 
can cause disruption or destruction of 
industrial processes, leading to potential loss-
of-life scenarios.
•	 PIPEDREAM’s Windows-related components 
facilitate host reconnaissance, command 
and control (C2), lateral tool transfer, and the 
deployment of unsigned rootkits.
•	 CHERNOVITE can leverage PIPEDREAM’s 
multiple components to perform rapid 
reconnaissance of ICS networks by using a 
variety of mechanisms, including: 
o	Identifying known MAC addresses 
o	Port numbers 
o	HTTP banners 
o	Omron’s proprietary Factory Interface 
Network Service Protocol (FINS) 
o	Modbus 
o	Schneider’s custom Discovery broadcast 
protocol (NetManage).
•	 CHERNOVITE can achieve Develop, Deliver, 
Install/Modify, and Execute ICS Attack 
portions of the ICS Cyber Kill Chain Stage 2 in 
several ways. These are some examples:
o	Remotely interacting with PLCs using 
CODESYS to support numerous attacks 
like brute-force passwords, performing 
denial-of-service (DoS) attacks against the 
controller, and severing connections.
o	Remotely interacting with Omron PLCs 
through HTTP and Telnet to load a native 
implant to support further command 
execution.
o	Remotely interacting with Omron PLCs 
through exposed HTTP endpoints to 
change the operating mode (program, 
run, etc.), backing up and restoring 
configurations, and wiping the PLC’s 
memory, among other capabilities.
o	Writing arbitrary node attributes on an 
OPC-UA server.
•	 CHERNOVITE can trigger Denial of Control 
and Denial of View for operators using 
multiple methods.
•	 CHERNOVITE disrupts operational 
technology by subverting and masquerading 
within trusted processes.
•	 CHERNOVITE can significantly extend 
time-to-recovery after an industrial incident 
by disabling process controllers, potentially 
requiring them to be returned to the 
manufacturer before reuse.
•	 CHERNOVITE can operate across process 
and security zones by using PLCs as 
network proxies across an OT environment, 
potentially bypassing firewalls, DMZs, and 
perimeter-based threat detection.
•	 CHERNOVITE can undermine authentication 
and encryption inside OT environments by 
collecting network traffic from PLCs and 
weakening PLC authentication.

WHITEPAPER
TLP: WHITE information may be distributed without restriction
PIPEDREAM is a collection of utilities that includes tools for reconnaissance, manipulation, and 
disruption of PLCs, as well as tools for intrusion operations against Windows devices. At the 
highest level, the PLC-related components of PIPEDREAM provide the adversary with an interface 
for manipulating the targeted devices. Tools in PIPEDREAM can scan for new devices, brute 
force passwords and sever connections, and crash the target device. To accomplish these goals, 
PIPEDREAM uses several different protocols, including Omron’s proprietary FINS, Modbus, and 
Schneider Electric’s implementation of CODESYS. Given the variety of protocols that PIPEDREAM 
abuses, CHERNOVITE possesses a breadth of ICS knowledge beyond any of Dragos’s previously 
discovered threat groups. 
Modbus TCP
Modbus is a serial communication protocol 
developed and published by Modicon® in 1979 for 
use with its PLCs. In simple terms, it is a method 
used for transmitting information over serial 
lines between electronic devices. Modbus later 
adopted the Open Systems Interconnect (OSI) 
TCP/IP communications protocols to expand 
communications over interconnected networks. 
The resulting protocol is now commonly referred 
to as Modbus TCP and is one of the most common 
ICS protocols.1 
OPC-UA
The OPC Unified Architecture (UA), released 
in 2008, is a platform-independent service-
oriented architecture that integrates all the 
functionality of the individual Open Platform 
Communications (OPC) Classic specifications into 
one extensible framework.2 
CODESYS
With the adaptable CODESYS Control runtime 
system, any intelligent device is transformed 
into a complete IEC 61131-3 controller. PLC 
manufacturers use a toolkit to port the CODESYS 
runtime system on their device and turn it into a 
CODESYS-compatible IEC 61131-3 PLC.3 
Windows
ASRock Motherboard Utility is an all-in-one 
utility designed for system updates and 
software downloading. It is integrated with a 
variety of applications and support software. 
ASRock Motherboard Utility provides the latest 
BIOS updates and system upgrade software 
for users to download. ASRock Inc. is the 
world's third-largest motherboard brand and 
manufactures both industrial and consumer 
computers and hardware.4 
PIPEDREAM can also be used to execute attacks against the ubiquitous industrial technologies 
listed below.

WHITEPAPER
TLP: WHITE information may be distributed without restriction
PIPEDREAM utilizes PLC implants to execute untrusted code on the PLC devices themselves beyond 
the view of the host-based monitoring found on Windows and Linux assets. Implants could live on 
PLCs for years before they are discovered, as only a firmware forensic analysis of a PLC would reveal 
the existence of the implant.
Figure 1 - Mapping for CHERNOVITE/PIPEDREAM MITRE ATT&CK for ICS Techniques
CHERNOVITE’s PIPEDREAM is a highly capable offensive ICS attack framework. It can execute 36 
known ICS attack techniques (which is 46 percent of known ICS attack tactics) as measured against 
the MITRE ATT&CK for the ICS behavior matrix, shown in Figure 1.

WHITEPAPER
TLP: WHITE information may be distributed without restriction
PIPEDREAM Utilities Explained
There are a few key design decisions about 
PIPEDREAM that indicate CHERNOVITE’s 
development team characteristics.
Both EVILSCHOLAR and BADOMEN are 
extensible and modular. This fact suggests that 
developers intend to support the tool long term. 
They are aware that the toolsets need to adapt 
to new operational requirements. In other words, 
they may need to be extended for new target 
devices. The design is comparable to common red 
team tools such as Metasploit and Powershell 
Empire. Furthermore, the tools are easy to use, 
which means the developers are likely aware 
they may need to be used by operators less 
knowledgeable than the developers.
MOUSEHOLE provides an interactive capability 
for manipulating OPC-UA server nodes and 
the associated devices. MOUSEHOLE is akin 
to an upgraded CRASHOVERRIDE and is the 
first time Dragos has witnessed a threat group 
learning from another threat group, in this case, 
ELECTRUM’s attack. This indicates that the 
adversary is aware of successful attacks and is 
actively seeking to develop a mature capability 
to achieve a similar impact.
The addition of DUSTTUNNEL and LAZYCARGO 
to PIPEDREAM indicates that CHERNOVITE 
is not only thinking about OT. They are also 
thinking about how it can achieve an end-to-end 
attack, starting with an IT intrusion, pivoting 
into OT, and executing an attack that covers ICS 
Kill Chain Stages 1 and 2.
The breadth of knowledge required to develop 
these tools indicates that CHERNOVITE is highly 
knowledgeable of ICS protocols, devices, and 
how to apply this knowledge to achieve an 
effect. They likely have a budget for acquiring 
devices to test their toolset.
Given these indicators, Dragos 
assesses with high confidence 
that CHERNOVITE is highly motivated, 
skilled in software development methods, 
well versed in ICS protocols and intrusion 
techniques, and well-funded.
The following is a list of the utilities with their capabilities. It is important to note that while the 
adversary could use these tools together, they are not required to be deployed together. PIPEDREAM 
should be viewed as a toolkit rather than a holistic attack suite.
EVILSCHOLAR
A capability 
designed to discover, 
access, manipulate, 
and disable 
Schneider Electric 
PLCs.
BADOMEN
A remote shell 
capability designed 
to interact with 
Omron software and 
PLCs.  
MOUSEHOLE
A tool for interacting 
with OPC-UA servers. It 
is designed to read and 
write node attribute 
data, enumerate the 
Server Namespace and 
associated NodeIds, 
and brute force 
credentials.
DUSTTUNNEL
A custom remote 
operational implant 
capability to perform 
host reconnaissance 
and command-and-
control.  
LAZYCARGO
A capability that 
drops and exploits a 
vulnerable ASRock 
driver to load an 
unsigned driver.

Dragos Platform Detections are designed to alert on PIPEDREAM behavior 
at these points in the ICS Cyber Kill Chain
PHASE 1:  IT NETWORK INTRUSION
CHERNOVITE could deploy DUSTTUNNEL within 
an enterprise network through phishing or 
compromised remote access. Using DUSTTUNNEL's 
command-and-control functions, CHERNOVITE 
could drop additional tools such as Mimikatz to 
gather credentials to access a legitimate account and 
gain a persistent foothold in the enterprise network. 
From there, DUSTTUNNEL can allow the adversary 
to enumerate the network to locate IT-OT DMZ and 
then move laterally using captured credentials. At 
this stage, CHERNOVITE may deploy LAZYCARGO 
to install a rootkit to protect the established foothold 
within the corporate network.
PHASE 2:  OT ENUMERATION
DUSTTUNNEL can allow CHERNOVITE to traverse 
to operational technology (OT) networks or jump 
boxes in the IT-OT demilitarized zone (DMZ). 
LAZYCARGO could also be deployed at this stage on 
operator stations/Human-Machine Interface (HMI) 
to install unsigned device drivers to manipulate 
traffic being sent between HMIs and field devices.
Suspected Deployment Scenarios
 
The following provides an example scenario of the deployment of PIPEDREAM components, along 
with the possible impact based on Dragos’ analysis of PIPEDREAM malware to date.
Figure 3: ICS Cyber Kill Chain
DRAGOS, INC.

WHITEPAPER
TLP: WHITE information may be distributed without restriction
PHASE 3:  CONTROLLER COMPROMISE
Once in the OT network, CHERNOVITE can 
leverage MOUSEHOLE to identify and brute force 
authentication to an OPC-UA server. CHERNOVITE 
can then enumerate devices on the OT network and 
see configurations, with the potential to manipulate 
tags and control points. Depending on the identified 
plant infrastructure, CHERNOVITE could deploy 
EVILSCHOLAR and/or BADOMEN to interact with 
Schneider Electric PLCs and Omron PLCs. 
PHASE 4:  FURTHER COMPROMISE 
OF CONTROL NETWORKS
EVILSCHOLAR proxy functionality could then be 
used to pivot into protected network segments 
by abusing Schneider Electric controller routing 
behavior. This functionality would allow further 
enumeration of controllers to be targeted in 
Modbus enumeration and exploitation.
PHASE 5:  CROWN-JEWEL OBJECTIVES
Capabilities to reprogram and potentially disable 
safety controllers and other machine automation 
controllers could then be leveraged to disable 
emergency shutdown systems, and subsequently 
manipulate the operational environment to 
unsafe conditions.

DEFENDING AGAINST PIPEDREAM – 
WHAT YOU CAN DO NOW
The Dragos Platform contains several detections for PIPEDREAM activity. Dragos customers employing 
the most recent Knowledge Packs can find these detections in the Dragos platform under the Content 
tab. Managed service customers can go through OT Watch. Dragos has already searched through 
Neighborhood Keeper participants for activity. Asset owners who are not Dragos platform customers 
should focus on identifying the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) detailed in this report and 
follow the recommended actions to mitigate impacts to your environment in Table 2. Much of the 
guidance to the community in the form of standards, frameworks, and regulations heavily focuses on 
preventing cyber attacks. This means the community often puts very limited focus on detection and 
response. Given the type of threat, it is imperative to be able to detect and respond instead of simply 
attempting to prevent access.
Schneider Electric Technology Mitigations
Action
Change default credentials
Restrict access to UDP/1740-1743, 
TCP/1105, and TCP/11740.
Restrict access to TCP/11740.
Disable the Schneider NetManage 
discovery service. 
Monitor affected PLCs for new 
outbound connections.
Validate the engineering 
workstation software - 
EcoStruxure Machine Expert.
Target
Where feasible, in conjunction with operations and site personnel for 
Schneider Electric TM2xx series PLCs:
Beginning with firmware 5.0, the devices use default credentials' 
Administrator’/’Administrator', and these should be changed to a complex 
password using the EcoStruxure software.
For all Schneider Electric TM2xx series PLCs
For non-Schneider PLCs known to communicate with this port from the 
engineering workstation
In conjunction with operations and site personnel, disable Schneider 
NetManage discovery service, as it is used by CHERNOVITE to discover PLCs 
(see VA-2019-02).
Look for communications to other PLCs on the network, on: UDP/1740-1743, 
TCP/1105, and TCP/11740.
Remove unnecessary software. If possible, apply application allow listing 
software on the workstation. Restrict the workstation from making outbound 
network connections, especially to Internet services.
Table 2: Schneider Electric Technology Mitigations
DRAGOS, INC.

WHITEPAPER
TLP: WHITE information may be distributed without restriction
Action
Enable OPC-UA security
Target
Ensure OPC-UA security is correctly configured with application 
authentication enabled and explicit trust lists. 
Ensure the certificate private keys and user passwords are stored securely.
Ensure mDNS (which actively broadcasts the location of OPC-UA servers) is 
disabled on all machines.
ICS operators can manage the security configuration for their OPC-UA devices 
using their engineering workstation software (in most cases). 
Using "sign-only" security mode with OPC-UA is optimal for ICS environments 
that leverage network monitoring solutions (like the Dragos Platform). Sign-
only security mode sends messages unencrypted but with an authentication 
code that allows receivers to be sure the message came from a trusted sender. 
This protects against tools like MOUSEHOLE that send unauthorized messages 
to OPC-UA clients and servers while allowing the packets to be inspected by 
network security devices. 
Specific recommendations for OPC-UA security best practices can be found on 
the OPC-UA foundation’s website:
https://opcfoundation.org/UA/Security/BestPractices.pdf
Action
Restrict access to TCP/80, 
TCP/9600, and UDP/9600
Validate the engineering 
workstation software - Omron 
Sysmac/CX-One/NX IO 
Configurator
Target
For all Omron PLCs. Only allow EWS systems to communicate on these ports.
Remove unnecessary software. If possible, apply application allow listing 
software on the workstation. Restrict the workstation from making outbound 
network connections, especially to Internet services.

OT Best Practices
MONITOR EAST-WEST ICS NETWORKS WITH ICS PROTOCOL AWARE 
TECHNOLOGIES
Perform network traffic monitoring with a focus on East-West communications instead of simply North-
South (ingress/egress) communications. PIPEDREAM’s ability to move from Engineering Workstation to PLC 
and then PLC to PLC means that simply monitoring North-South communications or putting emphasis on 
segregation will be insufficient. Specifically look for modifications to PLCs occurring outside of maintenance 
periods such as the changing of logic using native ICS protocols.
PLC NETWORK TELEMETRY ANALYSIS
Monitor for unusual interactions with PLCs from non-standard workstations or accounts.
ISOLATE MISSION CRITICAL SKID SYSTEMS
Consider implementing hardwired I/O between critical skid systems and distributed control systems I/O in 
place of direct communications if feasible.
NETWORK ISOLATION OF SAFETY SYSTEMS
Ensure network isolation for safety system components, monitor safety system networks for new connections 
or devices, and verify all configuration changes are compliant with change management procedures.
Long-Term Readiness
ICS-FOCUSED INCIDENT RESPONSE PLAN
Create and update an ICS-focused Incident Response (IR) plan with accompanying Standard Operating 
Procedures (SOP) and Emergency Operating Procedures (EOP) for operating with a hampered or degraded 
control system. Conduct a table top exercise focused on CHERNOVITE’s ICS Cyber Kill Chain with an emphasis 
on PIPEDREAM; use this opportunity to identify process and collection gaps that could hinder the detection 
and response efforts.
SPARE PARTS INVENTORY
Create and update a spare parts inventory for critical control system components, including hardware, 
software, firmware, configuration backups, and licensing information. Develop plans and procedures for 
sourcing and procurement of critical control system components. Consider the implementation of cold 
backups for rapid replacement of ICS level one devices.

How significant is PIPEDREAM to ICS/OT 
environments?
PIPEDREAM is the seventh-known ICS-
specific malware, following STUXNET, 
HAVEX, BLACKENERGY2, CRASHOVERRIDE/
INDUSTROYER, TRISIS/TRITON, and 
INDUSTROYER2. It is the first-ever known 
ICS-tailored malware assessed to be developed 
by a state actor to be identified before use for 
its intended purpose. New tactics, techniques, 
and procedures (TTP) based on detections and 
awareness will increase the overall security 
posture of OT environments, regardless of 
whether CHERNOVITE will deploy PIPEDREAM.
What questions should executives ask?
Executives should ask their security teams: 
•	 Do we have Omron, Schneider Electric, or 
OPC-UA in our environment(s)? If so, where 
and what type(s)? 
•	 If we needed to collect data from the 
environment, or validate that the system has 
not been modified, could we? 
•	 If the processes that use these devices 
or protocols are disrupted, is there a 
cybersecurity component in place to 
determine root cause analysis and if an attack 
has occurred? 
•	 Do we have an incident response plan that 
factors in the loss of any of these devices? 
What monitoring do we have in place to 
ensure it is not impacted?
Could this malware lead to loss of life? 
When discussing safety impacts, there must 
be a thorough understanding of the specific 
environments and how they are configured and 
implemented. It is possible to leverage PIPEDREAM 
in a wide range of industrial controllers and 
environments, meaning that it could also be 
leveraged in attacks on safety instrumented 
systems (SIS). Should CHERNOVITE reprogram the 
safety controller without appropriate outputs, the 
safety integrity of the plant would be compromised 
and could rely on mechanical fail-safes.  However, 
PIPEDREAM was found before the adversary could 
employ it for their desired effects, so there are no 
known targeted environments currently, and the 
adversary's goal may or may not be safety focused.
What are the Indicators of Compromise (IOC)?
Dragos recommends that defenders focus on the 
TTPs of PIPEDREAM components versus simple 
IOCs. Please refer to the mitigations in this paper.
If I do not have Schneider Electric or Omron in 
my network, should I care about PIPEDREAM? 
Yes, the capabilities are further reaching than 
Schneider Electric or Omron vendors. CODESYS 
protocol is used in hundreds of controllers far 
beyond Schneider Electric and Omron. 
Additionally, MOUSEHOLE targets and 
compromises OPC-UA servers.
OPC is an interoperability standard for the secure 
exchange of industrial automation data. It is 
designed to be platform-agnostic so devices from 
different vendors can exchange information.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

WHITEPAPER
TLP: WHITE information may be distributed without restriction
Multiple Industrial Ethernet (IE) protocols in 
manufacturing processes and plants — such 
as EtherNet/IP, PROFINET, or EtherCAT — are 
used across different networks to meet specific 
topology requirements and communication 
speeds or latency guarantees. Although these 
communication protocols are open, they are often 
incompatible, resulting in fragmented networks 
that cannot “speak” to each other.
OPC-UA was developed to solve this problem by 
allowing industrial devices operating with different 
protocols and on different platforms (Windows, 
Mac, or Linux, for example) to communicate 
with each other. OPC-UA goes beyond Industrial 
Ethernet in reach, including devices from the 
lowest level of the automation pyramid — such as 
field devices that deal with real-world data, such 
as sensors, actuators, and motors — to the highest 
levels, such as Supervisory Control and Data 
Acquisition (SCADA), Manufacturing Execution 
Systems (MES), and Enterprise Resource Planning 
(ERP) systems, as well as to the cloud.1
What’s the attribution?
Dragos does not make assessments about 
attribution. It is Dragos’s position that what is 
valuable to a significant majority of defenders 
is understanding the “what and how, not who.” 
Additionally, given the unique geopolitical 
nature of malicious capabilities and operations 
targeting critical national infrastructure, it could 
be disruptive to security efforts to focus on 
attribution. 
What could have the original equipment 
manufacturers done differently?
The original equipment manufacturers (OEM)— 
Schneider Electric and Omron— were targets but 
did not do anything wrong. Each time malware 
families target ICS, conversations emerge about the 
OEM. However, product security is not the same 
thing as ICS security. CHERNOVITE takes advantage 
of the native functionality available in the industrial 
environment and does not rely on vulnerabilities 
in the ICS equipment to achieve its operations. 
Any focus on the OEMs is misplaced; based on the 
Dragos analysis, it is likely that the adversary will 
develop modules against numerous equipment 
vendors.
