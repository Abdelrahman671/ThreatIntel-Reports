TAG-100 Uses Open-Source Tools in 
Suspected Global Espionage Campaign, 
Compromising Two Asia-Pacific 
Intergovernmental Bodies
TAG-100 has targeted high-profile 
government and private sector 
organizations globally in a suspected 
cyber-espionage campaign.
The group employs open-source 
remote access capabilities 
and exploits a wide range of 
internet-facing appliances for 
initial access, including enterprise 
VPN, firewall, and email appliances. 
TAG-100 compromised two major 
Asia-Pacific intergovernmental 
organizations, as well as diplomatic, 
government, semiconductor 
supply-chain, non-profit, and religious 
organizations in over ten countries.

Executive Summary
Recorded Future’s Insikt Group identified new suspected cyber-espionage activity targeting high-profile
government, intergovernmental, and private sector organizations globally. This activity, which we are
tracking under the temporary group designator TAG-100, has employed open-source remote access
capabilities and exploited a wide range of internet-facing appliances for initial access. Using Recorded
Future® Network Intelligence data, Insikt Group identified the likely compromise of the secretariats of
two major Asia-Pacific intergovernmental organizations by TAG-100 using the open-source,
multi-platform Go backdoor Pantegana. Other targeted organizations include multiple diplomatic
entities and ministries of foreign affairs, as well as industry trade associations and semiconductor
supply-chain, non-profit, and religious organizations globally. At this time, Insikt Group is continuing to
explore potential attribution for this activity; however, the specific targeting and victimology identified
align with a suspected espionage motive.
This activity highlights the ability to combine weaponized proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits with
open-source post-exploitation frameworks such as Pantegana, lowering the entry barrier for less
capable threat actors. It also allows higher-tier groups to refrain from using customized tools during
operations in which they are less concerned with being detected or in which heightened attribution
obfuscation is desirable. More widely, threat actors’ exploitation of vulnerable internet-facing devices
has been the focus of international cybersecurity efforts, including emergency patch requests within
the United States (US), the introduction of secure-by-design legislation by the United Kingdom (UK)
government, and attributing the use of this technique to multiple state-sponsored threat actors (1, 2, 3).
Despite this attention, this form of initial access continues to be widely used, as these devices typically
have limited visibility, logging capabilities, and support for traditional security solutions. As a result, it
exposes many organizations to the financial downsides of successful attacks, such as operational
downtime, reputational damage, and regulatory fines.
Organizations should employ intelligence-led patching prioritization of perimeter appliances that
consider the public availability of exploit code, as this availability can substantially increase the
likelihood of mass exploitation (1, 2, 3). Organizations should focus on regularly auditing internet-facing
and perimeter appliances, reducing their attack surfaces by disabling interfaces or portals where not
required, and improving defense-in-depth measures focusing on detecting post-exploitation
persistence, discovery, and lateral movement. Unless the security of internet-facing devices is
improved or organizations take steps to move away from vulnerable edges, these devices will almost
certainly continue to be widely exploited by a range of threat actors.
State-sponsored threat actors will likely continue using open-source capabilities to conduct
higher-tempo, deniable cyber operations with a lower risk of direct attribution or retaliation. The
widespread availability of open-source capabilities also allows state-sponsored threat actors to
outsource select cyber operations to a broader range of less capable proxy groups or private

contractors who may not possess or require in-house development skills due to the widespread
availability of open-source tools. This outsourcing will likely act as a force multiplier to further increase
the intensity and tempo of overall activity targeting enterprise networks, a trend already apparent
within some state-sponsored cyber-espionage programs.
Key Findings
●
TAG-100 has likely compromised organizations in at least ten countries in Africa, Asia, North
America, South America, and Oceania and, following initial access, employed the open-source
Go backdoors Pantegana and SparkRAT.
●
TAG-100 has also conducted probable reconnaissance and exploitation activity targeting the
internet-facing appliances of additional organizations in at least fifteen countries in North
America, Europe, and Asia.
●
Based on the identified TAG-100 targeted and victim hosts, it is likely that the group has
exploited a range of internet-facing products, including Citrix NetScaler ADC and Gateway
appliances, F5 BIG-IP, Zimbra Collaboration Suite, Microsoft Exchange, SonicWall, Cisco
Adaptive Security Appliances (ASA), Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect, and Fortinet FortiGate.
●
In the immediate aftermath of releasing a PoC exploit for Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect
firewall vulnerability CVE-2024-3400, TAG-100 conducted probable reconnaissance and
attempted exploitation against dozens of US-based organizations running these devices.
●
The widespread targeting of internet-facing appliances is particularly attractive because it offers
a foothold within the targeted network via products that often have limited visibility, logging
capabilities, and support for traditional security solutions, reducing the risk of detection
post-exploitation.

TAG-100 Exploitation of Internet-Facing Appliances
Figure 2: Overview of TAG-100 operations (Source: Recorded Future)
TAG-100 has conducted reconnaissance and exploitation activity targeting a wide range of
internet-facing appliances belonging to organizations in at least fifteen countries, including Cuba,
France, Italy, Japan, and Malaysia. Notably, this included the targeting of multiple Cuban embassies,
including in Bolivia, France, and the United States.
In March 2024, TAG-100 was identified targeting internet-facing Citrix NetScaler and F5 BIG-IP
appliances and Outlook Web App login portals globally. In multiple instances, these targeted
organizations directly overlapped with subsequent victims communicating with TAG-100 Pantegana C2
servers.
Beginning on April 16, 2024, TAG-100 conducted probable reconnaissance and exploitation activity
targeting Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect appliances of organizations, mostly based in the US, within
the education, finance, legal, local government, and utilities sectors. The timing of this activity aligned
4

with the release of a PoC exploit for the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect firewall remote code
execution vulnerability CVE-2024-3400.
In one instance, an open directory present on the staging server attributed to TAG-100, 209.141.57[.]75,
contained a publicly available exploit for the Zimbra Collaboration Suite vulnerability CVE-2019-9621.
Employing Multiple Open-Source and Offensive Security Capabilities
In addition to employing publicly available exploits, TAG-100 has also used multiple open-source or
offensive security post-exploitation frameworks targeting multiple operating systems, including
Pantegana, SparkRAT, LESLIELOADER, Cobalt Strike, and CrossC2.
Pantegana
Pantegana is an open-source malware family written in Go that features a cross-platform payload client
(Windows, Linux, OSX) and uses HTTPS for C2 communications. It supports file upload and download,
system fingerprinting, and direct command-line interaction with infected hosts. Pantegana also
supports obfuscation using the open-source obfuscator Garble. Publicly reported use of Pantegana in
the wild to date is minimal, other than a campaign exploiting a zero-day vulnerability in the Sophos
Firewall appliance attributed by Volexity to the suspected Chinese state-sponsored threat activity
group DriftingCloud.
In March 2024, Insikt Group identified a cluster of TAG-100 C2 servers, all exhibiting the same
self-signed transport layer security (TLS) certificate (see Appendix C), which aligns with the default
issuer and distinguished names seen in the Pantegana source code. On some TAG-100 Pantegana
servers, the group also employed a customized TLS certificate, which used the organization name
Google, Inc. rather than the default Pantegana value.
All identified TAG-100 servers were running identical services and were administered via the same
nodes associated with the commercial VPN service ExpressVPN. Several victim organizations have
been observed communicating with multiple TAG-100 Pantegana C2 servers over time, likely because
the threat actor transitioned between an older C2 server and a newer one.
SparkRAT and LESLIELOADER
Multiple TAG-100 servers were concurrently linked to malware samples of another open-source Go
backdoor, SparkRAT. TAG-100 also used a variant of the publicly available Go loader LESLIELOADER to
load SparkRAT in several instances, including a chain previously documented in March 2024 Kroll
research. On one occasion, we also observed a SparkRAT memory dump uploaded to a public malware
repository that almost certainly originated from a Djibouti government network compromised by
TAG-100.
In addition to communicating with a C2 IP address serving a specific Pantegana TLS certificate linked to
TAG-100, the Linux SparkRAT sample Sync shown in Table 1 was also identified being staged on a

Cobalt Strike
TAG-100 has used both traditional Windows Cobalt Strike Beacon payloads using the Jquery malleable
C2 profile as well as the open-source, cross-platform CrossC2 to generate Cobalt Strike Beacon
payloads for Linux systems. The C2 domain used in highlighted TAG-100 Cobalt Strike samples shown
in Table 2, www.megtech[.]xyz, was proxied via CloudFlare content distribution network (CDN) to a
backend, threat actor-controlled server administered via ExpressVPN, similar to wider TAG-100 activity.

Considering TAG-100 Attribution
While Insikt Group cannot attribute TAG-100 activity based on current evidence, the group’s consistent
targeting of intergovernmental, diplomatic, and religious organizations aligns with a suspected
espionage motive. Additionally, several targets of this activity align with historical targeting from
Chinese state-sponsored groups, including Asia-Pacific intergovernmental and diplomatic entities,
religious organizations in the United States and Taiwan, and a political party that has supported an
investigation into the treatment of the Uyghur people by the Chinese government. Despite this,
TAG-100’s use of open-source tooling coupled with the group’s pattern of life, targeting, and broader

Mitigations
●
Configure your intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention systems (IPS), or any
network defense mechanisms in place to alert on — and upon review, consider blocking
connection attempts to and from — the external IP addresses and domains linked in Appendix A.
●
Ensure security monitoring and detection capabilities are in place for all external-facing services
and devices. Monitor for follow-on activity likely to occur following exploitation of these
external-facing services, such as the deployment of web shells, backdoors, or reverse shells, as
well as subsequent lateral movement to internal networks.
●
Ensure a risk-based approach for patching vulnerabilities, prioritizing high-risk vulnerabilities and
those exploited in the wild as determined through the Recorded Future® Vulnerability
Intelligence module. Regarding Chinese state-sponsored groups, pay particular attention to
remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities in external-facing appliances within your
environment.
●
Practice network segmentation and ensure special protections exist for sensitive information;
consider implementing multi-factor authentication and extremely restricted access and storage
on systems only accessible via an internal network.
●
Detect and block malicious infrastructure such as Pantegana, SparkRAT, and Cobalt Strike C2
servers in real-time via the Recorded Future® Threat Intelligence module.
●
Recorded Future® Third-Party Intelligence module users can monitor real-time output to identify
suspected targeted intrusion activity involving key vendors and partners within physical,
network, and software supply chains.
●
By monitoring Malicious Traffic Analysis (MTA), Recorded Future clients can alert on and
proactively monitor infrastructure involved in notable communication to known TAG-100 C2 IP
addresses.
Outlook
The identified TAG-100 activity focused on targeting a variety of internet-facing appliances for initial
access and, subsequently, used open-source capabilities post-exploitation. The group has been
particularly interested in targeting government and intergovernmental organizations in Southeast Asia,
Europe, and North America. This activity further highlights an established trend of threat actors
persistently targeting internet-facing appliances for initial access. These appliances are particularly
attractive because they offer a foothold within the targeted network via products that often have
limited visibility, logging capabilities, and support for traditional security solutions, reducing the risk of
detection during post-exploitation activity. The prevalence of this activity has motivated both the US
and UK governments to issue parallel efforts to improve security in enterprise software and devices.
However, it will likely take time before the effects of this top-down approach are fully realized. In the
meantime, vulnerable network edges will almost certainly continue to be heavily exploited by financially
motivated and state-sponsored threat actors as long as organizations deploy them.
