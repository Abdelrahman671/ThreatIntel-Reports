Preface and acknowledgment 
The report is the first complete technical description of tactics, 
techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of the French-speaking financially 
motivated threat actor, codenamed OPERA1ER by Group-IB, one  
of the global cybersecurity leaders.
The report “OPERA1ER. Playing God without permission” takes a deep 
dive into the recent operations of the prolific cybercrime syndicate 
that is confirmed to have stolen at least $11 million since 2019 
in 30 targeted attacks with basic toolset. Although African banks were 
the most frequent victims, highly targeted campaigns have also been 
observed against many other industry verticals in different geographic 
regions.
Successful investigation into the attacks of OPERA1ER became 
possible thanks to a long-standing partnership between 
Group-IB Threat Intelligence Team and the Orange CERT Coordination 
Center (Orange-CERT-CC), in-house operational organization 
responsible for managing IT security incidents of the Orange Group, 
a multinational telecommunications operator. 
During almost three years the security teams involved in the 
investigation noticed that OPERA1ER upgraded their infrastructure 
and adapted TTPs to target new victims. Through threat intelligence 
and resource sharing, Orange-CERT-CC and Group-IB, as trusted 
cybercrime fighters, have been able to better understand the threat 
actor’s modus operandi and uncover previously unknown elements 
of their infrastructure. All findings have been compiled into this 
document so that the cybersecurity community could better track 
OPERA1ER’s activity and prevent their attacks in the future. The 
recommendations are also available in the report to help organizations 
avoid damage from OPERA1ER’s attacks.
We express our appreciation to Tom Ueltschi (@c_APT_ure) from Swiss 
Post CERT, CERT Société Générale, Pedro Deryckere from the Centre 
for Cybersecurity Belgium, and Internet Hosting Center (ihc.ru).
The report was written a year ago in 2021. Unfortunately, due 
to reasons outside of our control, we were not allowed to publish 
it earlier. While minor there are updated IOCs that can be found 
on Group-IB’s blog. The changes are small and don’t impact the 
overal findings.

INTRODUCTION
Introduction
In 2019, the Orange-CERT-CC (CERT Orange) Team detected a massive 
phishing campaign targeting banks and financial organizations in Africa 
and was asked to help manage a number of IT security incidents for 
an organization in Africa, which reported suspicious banking transactions 
during a weekend. During the investigation security analysts quickly 
confirmed abnormal transactions that led to money being withdrawn from 
ATM machines. The analysts linked this attack with the same actor, which 
was responsible for the phishing campaign and reconstructed the incident 
timeline.
CERT team started to retrieve forensics images and support the financial 
organization’s own security team in handling the incident. Further 
examination revealed that this organization’s internal infrastructure had 
been compromised to make the withdrawals.  
The cybercriminals took control of the computers of payment gateway 
operators. 
Further analysis revealed that the attacks most likely started with spear 
phishing emails carrying Remote Access Trojans (RATs) and other tools 
such as password sniffers and dumpers. The stolen credentials were used 
to gain administrator privileges to the domain controllers and the banking 
back-office systems. 
At the same time, another company reported that they had most likely 
been targeted by the same threat actor by May 2019 as the TTPs, 
observed during the attack, were almost identical. After these incidents, 
the security of affected systems was reported to have been reinforced. 
The threat actor was observed making other attempts to gain control 
of banking back-office systems of the affected organizations during the 
summer of 2019, after which the malicious activity appeared to slow down. 
Forensic examination by security teams established that, despite the 
measures taken, later in 2019, the attackers had found a way to get 
back into some systems of the affected organization and tried to make 
fraudulent operations using that same banking back-office system again, 
but failed. CERT Orange uncovered valuable findings, such as previously 
unknown adversary-controlled Command and Control server (C&C) 
domains and IP addresses.
Another round of incidents, involving the same threat actor targeting other 
organizations across Africa during 2020, demonstrated that the attackers 
were expanding their footprint. The same TTPs were observed in the 
attacks on companies in different countries. After examining all known 
TTPs, the CERT observed a pattern: the threat actor tailored the attacks 
to target specific teams within the attacked organizations. In May 2020, 
CERT мreached out to Group-IB Threat Intelligence Team with the request 
to help complete the investigation and get a better overview of the attacks 
without knowing that Group-IB separately had been tracking this malicious 
activity since H2 2019. 
Initially, when analyzing this threat actor, Group-IB Threat Intelligence 
Team divided the attackers into two different subgroups located in Africa. 
After receiving all known IP addresses, domain names and samples from 
CERT Orange, obtained during the initial incident response (IR), it became 
clear they were one French-speaking financially motivated hacker group. 
Group-IB researchers codenamed the gang OPERA1ER after an email 
account frequently used by the gang to register their domains.

INTRODUCTION
Earlier campaigns of OPERA1ER were tracked by Tom Ueltschi from the 
Swiss Post under the name DESKTOP-group. In October 2020, the Society 
for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) also gave 
the collective a name — Common Raven.
During the investigation Group-IB researchers were able to discover 
three backends of the OPERA1ER’s infrastructure used to manage the 
attacks in Africa. Thanks to a distinct malware deployment scheme 
Group-IB was able to identify at least 30 attacks carried out by OPERA1ER 
between 2019 and 2021. In all these attacks, the group successfully 
compromised payment and internet banking systems. In at least two 
banks, OPERA1ER was able to get access to SWIFT messaging interface, 
used to communicate the details of financial transactions. 
With the basic “off-the-shelf” toolkit OPERA1ER is confirmed to have 
stolen at least $11 million since 2019. But the actual amount of theft 
is believed to be higher than $30 million, as some of the compromised 
companies did not confirm the fact of money loss. 
Based on the information obtained during incident response engagements 
and threat intelligence activity this report describes  
for the very first time OPERA1ER’s complete TTPs, information about the 
most up-to-date tools used by the gang, as well as the kill chain. 
At the end of this report, the cybersecurity teams can find the tools 
to attribute the attacks and to track the infrastructure of the threat actor. 
This report contains hunting tricks and Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) 
which can be used to prevent OPERA1ER’s attacks and take proactive 
measures to defend the perimeter. Additional information is available upon 
request from Group-IB or CERT Orange.

KEY FINDINGS
Timeline  
and Geography 
of attacks
Findings from different investigation cases have been compiled 
here to provide a timeline of events that could be related 
to OPERA1ER’s activity.
The cases depicted without the $  symbol were obtained  
by Group-IB’s passive monitoring of infrastructure. Not all warned 
organizations confirmed that they had money stolen from them. However, 
according to other sources the attacker successfully stole money via 
SWIFT (moderate confidence) and payment systems  
(high confidence).
Some incidents on the timeline actually belong to the same organization, 
as they were targeted more than once by the attacker. At least 15 different 
victims, whose infrastructure got hacked, have been identified to date.

KILL CHAIN
Kill chain
As is the case with many threat actors campaigns, initial access of the 
targeted organizations began with spear phishing emails.
In addition to popular malicious topics like fake invoice or postal delivery 
notification, we observed many cases of topics linked to the targeted 
sector like: notification from government tax office, hiring offers from 
BCEAO (The Central Bank of West African States) or specific topics linked 
to digital money sector.
Mail subjects used during phishing campaigns observed in H1 2020:
	
→
“Cotisation CNPS important”
	
→
“Portail e-Impots  FACTURE”
	
→
“Direction Générale des Impôts”
	
→
“AVIS DE RECHERCHE PAR LA BCEAO /BCEAO 
RESEARCH NOTICE !!!”
	
→
“Note de service GIMAC”
	
→
“la BAD recrute”
	
→
“Swift MT103”
	
→
“la banque africaine de développement recrute”
	
→
“la BAD recrute le document a nouveau  disponible”
Here is a sample of spear phishing emails using a very specific topic linked 
to “GIMAC service” (Interbank Monetic Group of Central Africa) which was 
at this moment (April 2020) just launched in several targeted countries and 
offers the ability to transfer digital money between mobile operators and 
banks.
Initial access
Phishing email with a link to Google.Drive
OPERA1ER: PLAYING GOD WITHOUT PERMISSION

KILL CHAIN
Furthermore this email targeted only 18 users in the same country all 
linked to financial services associated with the topic and some VIPs.
Most of the emails were written in French, however researchers  
also reported emails written in English.
The emails contain links to Google Drive, Discord servers, compromised 
legitimate websites and malicious servers, which belong to the TA. Some 
of the observed emails contained as attachment ZIP archives.
OPERA1ER leveraged multiple families of well-known malware payloads 
to gain initial access. We were able to observe the following payload 
families through campaigns in 2019 and 2020: NanoCore, H-Worm (Houdini 
Worm), WSH Rat, Remcos, Adwind or QNodeJS.
It seems that NanoCore and H-Worm were mostly used until 2019 and were 
replaced gradually in 2020 by other observed families.
Payloads are delivered to the victim by attachment or download in phishing 
mail previously described. In most of the cases it is a ZIP archive with 
a relevant filename which contains a VBS (Visual Basic Script), JAR or SCR 
file with the same filename but different extension.

•	 BECAO.zip
•	 e-Impots FACTURE.zip
•	 Note de service GIMAC.zip
•	 Fiche de poste.zip
•	 NOTE DE SERVICE 17-2020 .pdf.zip
•	 SWIFT-103.pdf.zip
In 2021 OPERA1ER changed arsenal RATs 
to: Neutrino, BlackNET, bitrat and 888_rat,

KILL CHAIN
One of the most interesting things about delivery of those phishing emails 
is the commonalities between Message-ID in email headers. As noticed 
by Tom Ueltschi from the Swiss Post in his study about DESKTOPGroup, 
this threat actor seems to use Windows hosts – probable always the same 
virtual machines - with default hostname for sending phishing emails like: 
DESKTOP-8652N1S or DESKTOP-7U3H8EU.
Those hostnames could be tracked over different campaigns and we also 
observed that the same servers are used by the attacker for hosting 
their C2 and toolset to exploit targets. During the incident response 
on compromised networks these hostnames were observed in Windows 
Event Logs records when a threat actor tried to move laterally.
We also noticed an extensive use of SendGrid (https://sendgrid.com/) 
and compromised mail infrastructure like mail.groupechaka.com. This 
infrastructure was used by this threat actor since Q1 2020 at least and still 
being used as of today.

Pivoting
Once an initial RAT is deployed, operators analyze compromised machines. 
When a machine of interest is infected, Metasploit Meterpreter or Cobalt 
Strike Beacon is downloaded and launched.
It is interesting that OPERA1ER uses both frameworks during the lateral 
movement phase. Moreover the control is reverted to and from the two 
frameworks. In at least two incidents in different banks the attacker 
deployed Metasploit server inside compromised infrastructure. And it was 
used to attack other banks and organizations:
In at least one organization the criminals used an antivirus update server 
deployed in compromised infrastructure for pivoting.

Privilege  
escalation
Once a beacon is deployed the operator has to achieve persistent access 
to a compromised endpoint. To do that local administrative privileges 
should be obtained.
The operator uses several techniques to escalate privileges. 
To bypass UAC fodhelper and token duplication technique are 
abused:   elevate uac-fodhelper   OR   elevate uac-token-duplication  
To scan the system for local LPE vulnerabilities Sherlock scripts  
are used (https://github.com/rasta-mouse/Sherlock):  
  powershell Find-AllVulns  
COMahawk exploits were also used:  
https://github.com/apt69/COMahawk that exploits two vulnerabilities 
(CVE-2019-1405 and CVE-2019-1322) in UPnP to execute a command 
as an elevated user. It looks works the following vulnerabilities:
Currently that scanner looks for:
	
→
MS10-015: User Mode to Ring (KiTrap0D)
	
→
MS10-092: Task Scheduler
	
→
MS13-053: NTUserMessageCall Win32k Kernel Pool Overflow

→
CVE-2019-1405 
	
→
CVE-2019-1322
On x64 systems the operator utilizes Erebus LPE framework  
https://github.com/DeEpinGh0st/Erebus which contains exploits  
for various vulnerabilities.
Once the vulnerability is found a proper exploit is uploaded onto  
the system and executed. 
To escalate privileges the attacker used following techniques additional 
to LPE exploits:
•	 sc create “WindowsUpdate” binpath= “cmd /c start “C:\Windows\system32\cmd.
exe””&&sc config “WindowsUpdate” start= auto&&net start WindowsUpdate
•	 reg add “HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File 
Execution Options\Utilman.exe” /v Debugger /t REG_SZ /d “c:\Windows\system32\cmd.
exe
With that trick the operator can get access to the command prompt with 
SYSTEM privileges.
Now the operator has SYSTEM access to the compromised endpoint. 
OPERA1ER: PLAYING GOD WITHOUT PERMISSION

KILL CHAIN
After privileged access is obtained, the operator uses various ways 
to make beacons and RATs persistent.
The first persistence mechanism they used was a scheduled task to launch 
a tool every 5 minutes.
They also launched AnyDesk (https://anydesk.com/) to take control of some 
machines. AnyDesk is a legitimate remote administration tool, which 
might yield lots of false positives when hunting for it if it is used inside the 
targeted company.
Once they gained access to some servers, they launched the port-
forwarding software ngrok (https://ngrok.com/) on the servers to tunnel 
the RDP port. They could then make RDP connections to these 
servers from the Internet through the ngrok cloud service. As a means 
of persistence, they used NSSM (https://nssm.cc/) to wrap ngrok and 
launch it as a service. They used ngrok with a YAML configuration file 
containing an authentication token and the port to forward. This makes 
the command line very specific, so the running ngrok can be spotted even 
if the executable is renamed.
Typical ngrok command line:
“C:\Intel\ngrok.exe” start --all --config=”C:\Intel\config.yml”
Persistence

Aside from these tools, one of their main tactics was to use the VPN 
access and administrative proxies with the harvested credentials. 
It allowed them to connect directly to the network with their machines 
to perform their malicious actions.
We observed persistence achieved by creating registry key  
HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\Svchost
Moreover, after elevating privileges the operators abused Windows 
Management Instrumentation to uninstall AV:
WMI commands to turn off an AV
Once a beacon is deployed and privileges are escalated the operator starts 
to analyze the intranet. A massive scan on the network using Advanced 
IP Scanner was observed to collect more information on the IS and 
vulnerable opened tcp ports exposed services like RDP, network shares, 
servers, and workstations name.
For the same purposes portscan command also is utilized:
During the lateral movement phase the main goal of our threat actor 
is to gain access to the domain controller. To achieve that, they use several 
tools.
PowerSploit suite (https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit) 
is used to collect more data on AD. This project contains several 
powershell modules mainly used during pentest in order to test the 
security of the IT infrastructure. PowerView module is utilized heavily 
by the operator.

The following commands were executed:
•	 Get-NetFileServer — get a list of file servers used by current domain 
users.
•	 Invoke-UserHunter — finds machines on the local domain where 
specified users are. logged into, and can optionally check if the current 
user has local admin access to found machines.
•	 Get-CachedRDPConnection — queries all saved RDP connection 
entries on a target host.
•	 Find-LocalAdminAccess — finds machines on the domain that 
the current user has local admin access to.
•	 Get-GPPPassword — retrieves the plaintext password and other 
information for accounts pushed through Group Policy Preferences.
With help of these scripts the operator obtained servers for target list, 
exfiltrated passwords and enumerated RDP connections for further usage.
Another tool which is used by the operator is Spray-AD  
(https://github.com/outflanknl/Spray-AD):
SprayAD description on GitHub
With help of that tool the operator checked retrieved passwords against 
a user list.
To obtain hashes of logged in users on local machines mimikatz 
is utilized. Mimikatz is an open-source tool available on github: 
https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz/wiki. We also observed a use 
of executable binary, in-memory version using PowerShell using the 
specific PowerSploit module. Since 2020, the threat actor has massively 
used the Cobalt Strike framework and through the beacons use the 
Mimikatz command: run mimikatz’s sekurlsa::logonpasswords which is followed 
by hashdump
There were also observed usages of some tools from Sysinternals suite like 
AdExplorer.
The attackers profiled the domain on which the host is located. They used 
BloodHound to collect more details on the active directory environment 
in order to identify the attack path on the domain.

everything that is typed on the keyboard, screenshots of active 
sessions or applications.
•	 Nirsoft Remote Desktop PassView: https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/

To force users to enter their credentials while a keylogger is launched 
or to get passwords in memory the attacker locked a workstation 
by executing command rundll32.exe user32.dll, LockWorkStation followed 
by mimikatz’s misc::memssp.
The arsenal of tools used by the attackers were used as is. No particular 
obfuscation used to hide these tools.

OPERA1ER executed Invoke-EternalBlue command via Cobalt Strike 
framework. This command utilizes security issues patched by MS17-010. 
Interestingly that in 2021 these exploits are still relevant and the operator 
uses that way commonly.
In the first phase during 2019, lateral movement was performed using 
classical TTP like RDP, PSExec, PowerShell Remoting and WinRM.
In the second phase during 2020 lateral movement was massively 
performed using the Cobalt Strike framework using SMB Beacon. They 
seem cautious about their technique used during this lateralisation stage 
making their detection difficult. Multiple rebounds in order to mask the 
origin servers.
When the Cobalt Strike framework is used by attackers, they execute the 
PsExec_psh command for lateral movement. On the targeted host a service 
was created (event_id 7045) and a base64 encoded command was run (SMB 
Beacon).
Lateral  
movement
The following commands of Cobalt Strike were run to spawn new beacons 
on remote hosts:
•	 jump psexec_psh
•	 jump psexec
•	 jump psexec64
•	 jump winrm64
•	 jump winrm
During our observations by decoding the different base64 payloads 
we identified the named pipes with the same naming convention starting 
with the status pattern
(\\.\pipe\status_43a3,\\.\pipe\status_8dd6,\\.\pipe\status_70f5...).

The operators created their own domain administrator accounts which 
were used later for accessing the infrastructure and for lateral movement 
purposes.

Usually they create the following users:

Backend access
This part will focus on how OPERA1ER learns about digital money backend 
operation, how it harvests targeted credentials and finally how it evades 
security mechanisms in place.
Long term spying
Understanding mechanisms and how back-end operations work on such 
a platform requires a specific knowledge as described in the next part. 
It requires identifying key people involved in the process, protection 
mechanisms in place, links between back-end platform operations and 
end-users operation (cash withdrawal).
We estimate that the threat actor may have learned part of this knowledge 
from insiders but also possibly by themselves. This assumption is based 
on the following facts:
•	 There was almost 1 year between first intrusion associated with this 
threat actor and the final operation
•	 Heavy use of spying tools like NanoCore screen spying technology and 
RDP Wrapper Library by Stas’M* https://github.com/stascorp/rdpwrap 
to shadow RDP sessions
On the ground that our analysis is based on forensic artefacts gathered 
almost 1 year after the first intrusion we cannot be pretty confident on this 
assumption. Nevertheless, the event’s timeline indicates that the threat 
actor spent a lot of time preparing and planning this operation.
Final phase
OPERA1ER: PLAYING GOD WITHOUT PERMISSION

Backend credential harvesting
The digital money backend used by the attacker to transfer money 
and allow cash withdrawal has its own identity and authentication 
directory. User’s logins are different from those used for Active Directory 
authentication. Back-end provides a web HTTPS frontend for user access 
with login, password authentication.
As it will be described in next part the threat actor needed three different 
accounts with different profiles to perform fraudulent operations. 
Once it has identified targeted accounts the threat actor compromised 
workstations of associated users and installed the NanoCore RAT client. 
NanoCore provides a keylogging feature out of the box which has been 
used by the threat actor to steal back-end user’s login and password.
For this purpose the threat actor installed a dedicated “on premise” 
NanoCore C2 Server on a locally compromised Windows Server inside the 
victim network. This NanoCore C2 server was deployed one week before 
the fraud and seems to only serve for this specific task (i.e. back-end 
credentials stealing).
Forensic analysis of this host shows that the threat actor accessed keylog 
files the day of deployment and then the last two days before fraud. 
We did not identify a specific reason for this local C2 deployment. One 
of the hypotheses is that the threat actor wanted to increase and secure 
C2 availability to guarantee credential harvesting in this critical step of the 
attack. As it will be described in the next chapter, the final fraud operation 
required a lot of preparation with several people involved in the field. The 
unavailability of up to date credentials in the last step of the attack would 
have had a strong impact on a lot of people.
Banking fraud operation
The digital money platform has several system controls to prevent fraud 
and other abuses. One of the main controls consists of having various 
levels of access rights for the approval of a mobile money transaction. 
This is applied at each & every level in the user’s hierarchy, from customer 
to distributor/ partner and operator transactions. A user is normally not 
allowed to cumulate two or more levels of access rights.
For example, a distributor’s order to purchase a stock of digital money 
from the Operator for resale to end-users usually requires different 
levels of approval by different Operator Users known as Channel 
Administrators (CHADM). Upon receipt of the distributor’s purchase order, 
a purchase request is initiated by one channel administrator (CHADM 
with his personal login credentials) in the system. This request will then 
be submitted to another CHADM (with his personal login credentials) 
for a first level approval and finally once payment of the order has been 
received into our bank account & confirmed, a final approval is made 
by another CHADM after which the digital money ordered is credited into 
the distributor’s account. This is the basis of the segregation of duties 
principle so prevalent in all banking activities.

Moreover, the digital money platform is also structured in a three-
tiered architecture of different types of accounts which are allowed 
to do different types of transactions. A quick illustration is shown below:
Similarly, mobile wallets are classified in 3 different groups or levels 
of accounts; these are:
•	 Operator Accounts
•	 Channel User Accounts
•	 Subscribers Accountsts

KILL CHAIN
In the case of the banking fraud, once the threat actors have got access 
to internal systems , using the various attacks as described above, 
they managed to read (via Keylogger infections of workstations) and 
therefore steal, the login credentials (login details & password) of various 
key operator users responsible for the initiation, approval level 1 and 
approval level 2 of digital money for the movement / transfer of digital 
money in the system. The threat actors targeted Operator accounts which 
contained large amounts of digital money then using the stolen credentials 
transferred the digital money into Channel User accounts which they 
control & thereafter moved the stolen funds into a number of mule/
subscriber’s accounts which they either control or coordinate. Finally, the 
funds are withdrawn from the system in cash via a network of ATMs. Here 
clearly the attack and theft of funds were possible because the bad actors 
managed to accumulate different levels of access rights to the system 
by stealing the login credentials of various operator users.
Various tactics were used to enable the fraud to be carried out in the 
shortest possible way. These include the use of API’s specially designed 
for doing bulk debits from Operator Accounts and credits to Channel 
accounts and automating the USSD commands for transferring the stolen 
funds from the Channel Accounts into the mule accounts for subsequent 
cash-outs.
This following diagram explains each step of the threat actors’ attack.
The fraudsters first identify target accounts with a high value by searching 
through the payment system’s account database. They then transfer the 
money from these high value accounts to a small number of accounts they 
control. The fraudsters repeat the transactions multiple times to ensure 
each transaction is within the limits allowed by the system. Once the high 
value accounts are emptied, they distribute the stolen money to a large 
number of mule accounts that are used to withdraw the money from ATMs 
and/or point of sales.

KILL CHAIN
Alternatively, fraudsters can send the stolen money to accomplice 
accounts in another country where the money will be withdrawn using 
a local mule network.
We also tracked the timeline of the attack which appears as follows:
In one case, a network of more than 400 mule subscriber accounts were 
used to quickly cash out stolen funds mostly done overnight via ATMs. 
Thus, it is obvious that the attack was very sophisticated, organised, 
coordinated, and planned over a long period of time.
We found that the mules, which are subscribers accounts used to carry out 
the last leg of the fraud, have been recruited up to 3 months in advance. 
They consisted of both new and old accounts. A proportion of the mule 
accounts were new activations on the digital money platform using a web 
portal. We suspect these accounts have been subscribed by the bad actors 
or their accomplices. The portal allows subscribers to open a light account 
with limited KYC requirements until the submission, checking and validation 
of all the full KYC requirements, when the account will be opened in full, 
with much higher limits on transaction volume and value and balance limits. 
Most of the new accounts had not registered any digital money transaction 
until the fraud happened.
There were also many accounts which seem to have been opened 
by genuine subscribers and operating legitimately until after sometime, 
they went into a dormant state. Thereafter they were reactivated and used 
in the fraud. At last we have seen cases where some digital wallets have 
been recovered (we could not establish if this was the result of fraudulent 
activity or not) via a change in the SIM card commonly known as SIM Swap.
Regarding the Channel User accounts used in the second leg of the 
attack; these types of accounts are normally allocated to registered 
distributors/sub-distributors, retailers etc. in the distribution channel. 
The threat actors managed to get a few unused accounts from our top 
well-known distributors, which have not been involved in any fraudulent 
activity. We suspect that the bad actors might have corrupted the retail 
agents of those distributors to get hold on unused or dormant Channel 
User accounts or that there was some sort of collusion between the 
Retail agents and the bad actors. Following this observation, all unused &/
or dormant Channel User accounts have been purged from the system.

SMB Beacon
Orange CERT-CC team shared with Group-IB some tips to be used to easily 
detect SMB Beacons with your SIEM as well as particular code found in the 
Auto-It packer being a great example of opsec fail.
In order to facilitate this lateralization in the compromised network, the 
threat actor uses the software used by red teams during penetration tests, 
namely the Cobalt Strike framework. In our Case, this framework was 
used to deploy some « listeners » on compromised host (Workstations and 
mainly Domain Controllers).
To deploy those listeners, the framework offers several techniques like 
SMB, http or DNS beacons. The threat actor used a lot of SMB beacons, 
allowing attackers to perform pivoting attacks from server to server 
in compromised infrastructure. 
The SMB beacon offers the advantage of being drowned in the SMB 
traffic of the Microsoft network legacy SMB traffic making detection more 
difficult.
One of the first detection techniques implemented was monitoring the 
Artifact Microsoft EventID 7045 which is generated when attackers perform 
lateral movement through the framework. This results in the creation 
of an encoded command encoded in base 64 starting with the JaBz pattern.

AutoIt Packer
We observed that the Threat Actor extensively uses the same packer 
to protect its payloads. This packer was used to protect first stage payload 
delivered by mail but also inside targeted networks on new compromised 
hosts to install RAT.
Hereunder an operating diagram:
OPERA1ER: PLAYING GOD WITHOUT PERMISSION

TECHNICAL FOCUS
Samples are delivered as an auto-extractible CAB File built with IExpress 
Microsoft utility. PE files produced by IExpress are then modified to mimic 
known applications like VLC, Java, Regedit or TeamViewer: icon and version 
information inside PE Header are modified.
A very simple but interesting technique is used by the threat actor to try 
to evade the endpoint solution defense mechanism. The original CAB file 
size is mostly between 1 and 3 MB but the total size of extracted files 
is more than 115 MB. 
Packer obfuscates AutoIt script by inserting between each line of code 
the same block comments with random UTF16 chars. Inserted block size 
is around 0x4A300 bytes. Considering that this block of data is repeated 
around 400 times in the file it allows the compression algorithm 
to compress the file with a ratio of more than 100. We think the creator 
of this packer in addition to obfuscating the AutoIt script may have thought 
that it could evade endpoint security solutions which exclude files over 
a certain size from analysis.
The relevant lines of the AutoIt script can be dumped using the strings 
utility.
AutoIt script variables are specific to each sample: AutoIt interpreter file 
(xufzhfxy.exe), AutoIt script source file (xlltlfu.gla), encrypted payload (sayp.jee) 
and RC4 encryption key.

Instead of injecting payload into a running process or starting a known 
binary from disk the packer will copy RegSvcs.exe (Microsoft .NET Services 
Installation Utility) from Windows directory into %USERPROFILE% directory. 
The file will be renamed and start in suspended state to perform injection 
in last step.
The decryption of the payload is done through the load of RC4 assembly 
code in memory and called by CallWindowProc from user32.dll.
The RC4 encryption key could not be dumped from the script file using the 
strings utility because the key is made of random UTF-16 characters (The 
–e l option only dumps ASCII characters interleaved with zeroes).
OPERA1ER: PLAYING GOD WITHOUT PERMISSION

TECHNICAL FOCUS
Furthermore the hex value of the key stored inside the file between 
quotation marks cannot be directly used to decrypt the payload. 
Developers of the packer use an AutoIt RC4 function with DllCall and pass 
key as an str argument instead of wstr and so AutoIt will try to convert 
an UTF16 string to ANSI.
Raw extracted binary key (30 UTF16 encoded char):
Resulting RC4 encryption key after conversion (30 ANSI char):
Result of this error is a big loss in key randomness because in most of the 
cases char will be converted to 3F which is “?”. It’s a great example of opsec 
fail after a bad copy and paste of code:

Most of C&C domains are registered on free dynamic DNS service. 
Favorite threat actor 1st level domain names are duckdns[.]org, ddns[.]net, 
zapto[.]org, hopto[.]org.
OPERA1ER also used dedicated domains for his purposes with 
topics linked to the target region or interest like afrikmedia[.]info, 
senegalsante[.]org, coris-bank[.]fr, bdm-sa[.]fr, banquealtantique[.]net.
OPERA1ER also registered two specific domains ****netad[.]com and 
****netad[.]ci trying to hide their malicious activities from targeted 
organizations. ****NETAD is the Active Directory internal domain name 
of one of the victims in Africa.

Hosting and 
infrastructure
Monitoring DNS records for identified domains during about 1 year 
we observed the following behaviours.
Most of the domains are hosted behind proxy services from AS “BLIX – 
Netbouncer UK1” and “www.portlane.com - Frootynet Sweden”. 
Associated VPN Providers seems to be “AzireVPN” and “FrootVPN” which 
both provide crypto-money payment and “no-NAT” IP to their customers.
Frequency of DNS A records updates vary between 2 to 10 updates 
by month. Some domains are more subject to updates than others.
It’s also interesting to observe that during short period of times 
some A records are updated to IP addresses part of what seems 
to be bulletproof host providers like GTHOST (ASN 63023 - GTHost - 
Edelino Commerce Inc.) or Serverion (ASN 213035 - Serverion B.V.).
During analysis of the infrastructure with help of Group-IB Graph it was 
noticed that C&C host both Metasploit and Cobalt Strike frameworks. 
Moreover some servers also hosted C&C panels of RATs.
For example my1empire.duckdns.org pointed to 108.62.49.249:
According to Graph the server hosts Metasploit and CS Team server 
on port 777. However, there are a lot of other ports, which handle incoming 
RAT connections.
There were only 5 servers deployed, both frameworks and CS Team server 
on port 777. But after filtering by amount of opened non-common ports 
only three remain:
•	 176.9.193.5
•	 108.62.49.249
•	 154.44.177.192

Conclusion 
This threat report reveals the damage that can be done 
by cybercriminals with “off the shelf” tools. Nevertheless, by slowly and 
careful inching their way through the targeted system, they were able 
to successfully carry out at least 30 attacks all around the world in less 
than three years. Many companies were attacked twice, which shows 
the importance of engaging experienced and competent DFIR teams 
to handle incidents to avoid repeated hacking. 
There are no zero-day threats in OPERA1ER’s arsenal, and the attacks 
often use exploits for vulnerabilities discovered three years ago. 
There is enough time to update the infrastructure and install security 
patches to greatly complicate the work of the adversaries and gain 
time. But organizations often neglect this basic security practice. 
OPERA1ER can prepare the attack for up to one year, studying the 
internal network of the organization, as well as learning how the 
digital banking systems were designed and planning the withdrawal 
of money. This time is also quite enough to identify the anomaly in the 
network and take measures to localize the incident. For example, 
Group-IB’s Managed XDR can easily detect not only an anomaly in the 
network, but also detect and block the threat at the initial stage, when 
employees receive phishing emails.
The recommendations in this report should be implemented by all 
organizations as part of best practices security operations. A clear 
understanding of the kill chain, which can be found in this report, 
as well as the tools and tactics of this group, makes it possible to take 
preventive measures to protect your organization and prevent 
financial losses.

RECOMMENDATIONSAND THREAT HUNTING TIPS 
Recommendations 
and threat hunting tips 
These best practices recommendations will help  
your organization avoid damaging attacks:
1.	 Check your infrastructure for indicators of compromise 
provided 
in this report 
2.	 Utilize external cyber threat intelligence solutions, such 
as Group-IB Threat Intelligence, to increase awareness 
of cyber threats relevant to your organization
3.	 Analyze all incoming emails with Malware Detonation 
Platforms, such as Group-IB Business Email Protection 
and Group-IB Managed XDR. 
4.	 Check traffic for outgoing connections on ports 777 and 
1600. 
5.	 Conduct an infrastructure audit to identify RATs, Metasploit 
Meterpreter and Cobalt Strike beacons within the 
perimeter. 
6.	 Configure domain control policies to encrypt passwords 
in memory. 
7.	 Update OS and install security patches in a timely manner. 
8.	 Restrict or limit PowerShell where it is not needed. Monitor 
executable scripts, pay special attention to powershell.exe 
processes with long base64-encoded strings in arguments 
or arguments typical of Cobalt Strike, Metasploit, 
CrackMapExec, etc.
9.	 Monitor all accounts within a domain.
