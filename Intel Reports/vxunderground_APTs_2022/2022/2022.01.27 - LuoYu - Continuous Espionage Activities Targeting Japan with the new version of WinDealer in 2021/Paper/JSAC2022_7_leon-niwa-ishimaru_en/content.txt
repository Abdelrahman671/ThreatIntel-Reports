Hardcoded version of WinDealer
The hardcoded version of WinDealer probably comes from the built date.
Version format: {Main_version}.{year}.{month+day}
We observed four versions from collected samples:
16.18.1030
17.19.0505
18.19.0628
18.20.1225
NEW
Hardcoded version of WinDealer
Before 2016, WinDealer used hardcoded development timestamp string as
mutex string
We use the mutex string prefix to distinguish the backdoor version
WORK_20080729400351362402 →WinDealer 2008
MANAGE_20130831175600761943 →WinDealer 2013

At first, the malware is designed to collect the sensitive data from 
popular messaging application in China. (support 15 command)
In 2013, it supported more spying function. (support 26 command)
The non-exist URL: "http://www.360.cn/status/getsign.asp"
Since 2016, There’s hardcode version in WinDealer which
contains the feature to steal shadowsocks profile.
The latest version of WinDealer
The non-exist URL was changed to "http://www.360.cn/status/getonefile.asp"
The non-exist URL was changed to non-exist domain:

C2 communications
WinDealer Related Component
Steganography Technique
The malware contains an additional module in the resource “Bitmap” 
using steganography technique to evade security products.
The encrypted DLL in res ID:129

Size (4 bytes)

Embedded DLL

How to find BLOB and decrypt
The search method is to add 0x3000 bytes from the beginning of the 
image, then advances 1 byte at a time and compares the magic hex 
pattern to find the desired location. 
The embedded DLL is XORed using the 10 bytes key
The functionality of embedded DLL
Export function name
Description
partInitOpt
Mapping embedded functions on VFT for using 
from main module as initialization
GetConfigInfo
Mapping embedded malware configuration data 
from the DLL
AutoGetSystemInfo
Creating many threads to get infected device 
information
Generated victim ID set in a reg key
The victim ID format: MD5(“<MAC address><Physical_Drive_info><username>”)
The malware creates a specific registry key to store the generated victim ID to use 
in the next execution.
As a unique hidden trick, the victim ID is not stored raw data, the malware 
converts the 4 bytes victim ID to an IP address style.
Collecting host information
Computer name
Username
CPU info
OS version
Network interface
External IP address
User account
Screenshots
C2 communications
Before sending the victim data, the malware will add a custom header to the 
data
Interesting features:
Getting victim label from non-exist domain or non-exist URL based on WinDealer version
http://www.360[.]cn/status/getsign.asp
http://www.360[.]cn/status/getonefile.asp
NXDOMAIN: http://www[.]microsoftcom/status/getsign.asp
C2 anti-tracking mechanism
IP address generation algorithm (IPGA)
NEW
NEW
Getting victim label from NXDOMAIN
C2 anti-tracking mechanism
Use IPGA (IP Generation Algorithm) to generate a random C2 IP address
when backdoor does not have C2 config
The randomly generated IP will exist within specific IP address ranges
Ex: 113.62.0.0 - 113.63.255.255 or 111.120.0.0 - 111.123.255.255
This mechanism will prevent researchers from tracking down the real C2 IP

WinDealer Related Component
We have found the downloader of WinDealer in the wild since 2013.
In addition, we found old Windows kernel module downloader (2015 ~ 2017)
PDB string: “Z:¥O¥植入相关¥本地溢出¥downexecdriver¥bin¥FAT32.pdb”
WinDealer Related Component
We discovered a WinDealer downloader which contains a legitimate domain but the URL path 
is non-existing. (DNS hijacking or network hijacking)
User-agent is an unique "BBB," which also appears in WinDealer RAT

WinDealer Related Component
There’re multiple dropper/loader samples related to WinDealer.
The malware resource “AAA” contains an encrypted payload
The encrypted payload in res ID:103
Ex. The malware uses XOR to decrypt the payload, then loads the decrypted payload

somehow even though accessing a legitimate destination of updater.

After created WinDealer on the startup folder, once victim user logged in this host, 
WinDealer is executed and sends stolen data over 6999/UDP to backbone router.

YoudaoDict(legitimate tool) tried to download the WinDealer, version.dll, then dll-
sideloading it and executed embedded dll at the end of June 2021.
AV has detected this version’s WinDealer several times though, due to the 
replacement of AV in this organization, the victim host resulted in compromised.

Countermeasures against this campaign
Cyber Hygiene Matters!
Check before clicking links and downloading files
While preventing malware downloads with SIGINT is very difficult, 
detecting and dealing with them is relatively easy.
Deployment  of AV and continuous its alert monitoring 
Firewall implicit denial setting, and in the case of WFH, Windows 
Firewall setting is recommended on the host side as well.
Conclusions
LuoYu is increasing its attack scope to companies and users in East 
Asia, including Japan (and their branches in China).
Notable TTPs
Arsenals having capabilities to attack multiple platforms
Utilization of popular shared tools (i.e., ShadowPad, PlugX)
Various attack vector such as SIGINT, watering hole attacks, etc.
LuoYu’s evolution throughout 2021 indicates its potential in 
developing into a more sophisticated group in the future
