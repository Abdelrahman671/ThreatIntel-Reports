Note: The analysis cut-off date for this report was December 11, 2023.
Executive Summary
Recorded Future’s Insikt Group® has observed TAG-70 leveraging cross-site scripting (XSS)
vulnerabilities against Roundcube webmail servers in Europe, targeting government, military, and
national infrastructure-related entities. TAG-70 overlaps with activity reported by other security
vendors under the aliases Winter Vivern, TA473, and UAC-0114. The group likely conducts
cyber-espionage campaigns to serve the interests of Belarus and Russia and has been active since at
least December 2020, primarily targeting governments in Europe and Central Asia.
In their latest campaign, TAG-70 likely started exploiting Roundcube webmail servers at the beginning
of October 2023 and continued until at least mid-October. Insikt Group detected at least 80
organizations targeted in this campaign; the victims were primarily entities in Georgia, Poland, and
Ukraine. This campaign has been linked to additional TAG-70 activity against Uzbekistan government
mail servers, which involved infrastructure reported by Insikt Group in February 2023.
TAG-70’s targeting of Roundcube webmail servers is only the most recent instance of targeting email
software attributed to Russia-aligned threat actor groups. In June 2023, Insikt Group discovered that
the Russian state-sponsored cyber-espionage group BlueDelta (APT28, Fancy Bear) was targeting
vulnerable Roundcube installations across Ukraine and had previously exploited CVE-2023-23397, a
critical zero-day vulnerability in Microsoft Outlook in 2022. Other well-known Russian threat actor
groups, such as Sandworm and BlueBravo (APT29, Midnight Blizzard), have also previously targeted
email solutions in various campaigns (1, 2, 3).
In the context of the ongoing war in Ukraine, compromised email servers may expose sensitive
information regarding Ukraine’s war effort and planning, its relationships and negotiations with its
partner countries as it seeks additional military and economic assistance, expose third parties
cooperating with the Ukrainian government privately, and reveal fissures within the coalition supporting
Ukraine. Furthermore, the targeting of the Iranian embassies in Russia and the Netherlands may be
linked to a desire to assess Iran's current diplomatic activities and foreign policy, especially as Russia
continues to rely on Iran-provided weapons in Ukraine. Espionage against the Georgian Embassy in
Sweden and the Georgian Ministry of Defence is likely to have similar foreign policy-oriented
motivations, particularly as Georgia renewed its aspirations for European Union (EU) membership and
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) accession following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in early
2022.
Organizations can mitigate the risk of compromise in TAG-70’s Roundcube campaign by ensuring that
Roundcube installations are patched and up-to-date, as well as by blocking and hunting for indicators
of compromise (IoCs) in their environments (for a list of relevant IoCs, see Appendix A).

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS
Key Findings
●
TAG-70’s espionage campaign targeted European government and military mail servers. The
campaign has been active since at least December 2020, primarily focusing on European and
Central Asian governments. TAG-70 employs advanced techniques and tools, indicating that a
well-funded and skilled threat actor is behind the operation.
●
TAG-70 has demonstrated a high level of sophistication in its attack methods. The threat actors
leveraged social engineering techniques and exploited cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in
Roundcube webmail servers to gain unauthorized access to targeted mail servers, bypassing the
defenses of government and military organizations.
●
By infiltrating mail servers, TAG-70 aims to collect intelligence on European political and military
activities, possibly to gain strategic advantages or undermine European security and alliances.
The campaign's intended victims indicate that it has been conducted to serve the interests of
Belarus and Russia.
●
This TAG-70 campaign has had a significant impact, as the malware may have intruded into email
servers in multiple European countries, including Georgia, Poland, and Ukraine. Additionally,
Insikt Group detected TAG-70 targeting Iran’s embassies in Russia and the Netherlands, which is
notable given Iran’s support of Russia’s war effort in Ukraine. TAG-70s actions highlight the
widespread nature of the campaign and its implications for national security.
●
TAG-70’s ability to compromise mail servers poses a significant risk, as it enables the theft of
sensitive information and manipulation of communication channels.
Background
In February 2023, CERT-UA reported details of TAG-70 activity in which the threat actors created a
spoofed website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine. The site lured users to download
malicious software for "scanning infected PCs for viruses".
Insikt Group detected TAG-70 conducting website impersonation attacks in February 2023. In this
activity, TAG-70 appended a domain with legitimate domains of multiple Eastern European government
websites to deliver script-based malware.
In March 2023, Proofpoint reported a new campaign in which TAG-70 exploited publicly facing Zimbra
webmail portals via CVE-2022-27926. This activity aimed to gain access to the emails of military,
government, and diplomatic organizations across Europe involved in the Russia-Ukraine War.
Recorded Future highlighted TAG-70 domain registrations and suspected phishing lure material linked to
these domains in April 2023.
On October 25, 2023, ESET detailed an XSS zero-day CVE-2023-5631, used by TAG-70 to exploit
vulnerable Roundcube webmail servers. The vulnerability enabled the attackers to list and exfiltrate

content from victims' mailboxes with no interaction from the victim required other than opening an
infected email.
Threat Analysis
Beginning March 16, 2023, Insikt Group used Recorded Future Network Intelligence to detect suspicious
activity from a victim IP address belonging to the Center for Economic Research and Reforms of
Uzbekistan. The victim IP address was observed communicating with the domain bugiplaysec[.]com
over TCP port 443, which at the time resolved to IP address 176.97.66[.]57. This data was then likely
relayed to command and control (C2) IP address 198.50.170[.]72 on TCP port 7662. It is suspected that
TAG-70 administered 198.50.170[.]72 via Tor, as shown in Figure 1. CERT-UA attributed the domain
bugiplaysec[.]com to TAG-70 in February 2023.
Insikt Group observed similar activity between an IP address registered to the Embassy of the Republic
of Uzbekistan in Ukraine and a previously reported C2 domain, ocsp-reloads[.]com, which resolved to
IP address 38.180.2[.]23. This additional C2 likely forwarded the data it received to IP address
86.105.18[.]113 on TCP port 1194 and TAG-70 likely connected to the C2 via Tor, also shown in Figure 1.

Malware Analysis
On July 27, 2023, a new TAG-70 domain, hitsbitsx[.]com, resolved to IP address 176.97.66[.]57. Insikt
Group also detected this domain in a JavaScript-based malware sample uploaded to a malware
repository, shown in Figure 2: SHA256:
ea22b3e9ecdfd06fae74483deb9ef0245aefdc72f99120ae6525c0eaf37de32e.
The discovered JavaScript malware matches the second-stage loader used in TAG-70’s previous
Roundcube exploitation described by ESET. This JavaScript is loaded via XSS from a malicious email
and is used to decode a Base64-encoded JavaScript payload (jsBodyBase64). The payload is then
inserted into the Document Object Model (DOM) of the Roundcube webpage within a newly created

script tag.
Figure 2: Second-stage JavaScript loader (Source: Recorded Future)
The content of the JavaScript payload, jsBodyBase64, shown in Figure 3, suggests the actors were
targeting the Georgian Ministry of Defence domain mail[.]mod[.]gov[.]ge. The structure of this payload
overlaps with the one described in ESET’s report; however, its functionality differs: instead of exfiltrating
the contents of the victim’s mailbox, it logs the user out of Roundcube and presents them with a new
sign-in window. When the victim submits their credentials, their account name, username, and
password are sent to the C2 server, and they are then logged into Roundcube.

was hosted on the domain bugiplaysec[.]com, used the same JavaScript loader technique, and had a
similar credential exfiltration payload. The content within the payload suggests that it was used to
target the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence, as shown in Figure 4.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS
The domain recsecas[.]com resolved to 38.180.76[.]31 from late September 2023 and was used in
TAG-70’s exploitation of Roundcube webmail servers, as reported by ESET in October 2023. Previously,
in June 2023, the domain resolved to IP address 176.97.76[.]129. Historical server banners for
176.97.76[.]129 were similar to those detailed in Table 2, with the exception that TCP port 80 was also
returning an HTTP 403 Forbidden page in addition to TCP port 443.
During the aforementioned Roundcube campaign, TAG-70 used an infrastructure configuration similar to
the one detected by Recorded Future in March (Figure 1). However, Insikt Group identified a second C2
server within the Roundcube relay chain, which utilized TCP port 443 (as shown in Figure 5) rather than
a static high ephemeral port. As in the March campaign, Recorded Future observed TAG-70
communicating with the upstream C2 via Tor to obfuscate their true location.

In this campaign, TAG-70 began exploiting Roundcube webmail servers at the beginning of October
2023 and continued until at least mid-October. Recorded Future detected TAG-70 targeting at least 80
separate organizations, primarily focusing on entities in Ukraine, Georgia, and Poland, as shown in
Figure 6.
Notably, there were some victims outside of these countries, such as the Embassy of Iran in Moscow,
the Embassy of Iran in the Netherlands, and the Embassy of Georgia in Sweden.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS
Mitigations
●
Strengthen Email Security Measures: Implement advanced email security solutions, such as
multi-factor authentication, encryption, and secure email gateways, to protect mail servers from
unauthorized access and data breaches.
●
Conduct Regular Security Audits: Regularly audit mail servers to identify vulnerabilities,
misconfigurations, and potential entry points for attackers. Address any identified weaknesses
promptly to minimize the risk of exploitation.
●
Employee Awareness Training: Provide comprehensive training on email security best practices,
including identifying phishing emails, suspicious attachments, and links. Regularly reinforce
training to maintain a high level of awareness and vigilance.
●
Implement Network Segmentation: Separate mail servers from other critical systems by
implementing network segmentation. This practice limits the lateral movement of threats,
preventing a single compromised system from compromising the entire network.
●
Collaborate with Security Vendors and Intelligence Agencies: Establish partnerships with
reputable security vendors and intelligence agencies to leverage their expertise and threat
intelligence. Regularly exchange information on emerging threats and indicators of compromise
to enhance proactive defense measures.
●
Develop Incident Response Plans: Create comprehensive incident response plans that outline
clear protocols for detecting, responding to, and recovering from security incidents. Regularly
test and refine these plans through simulated exercises to ensure an effective response in
real-world scenarios.
Outlook
This latest campaign by Belarus and Russia-aligned TAG-70, which targets European government and
military-owned email servers, suggests a long-term strategic interest in gathering intelligence regarding
the war in Ukraine and the evolving foreign policies of regional powers. Belarus and Russia-aligned
cyber-espionage groups will almost certainly continue, if not expand, targeting webmail software
platforms, including Roundcube, while the conflict in Ukraine continues and while tensions with the EU
and NATO remain high.
