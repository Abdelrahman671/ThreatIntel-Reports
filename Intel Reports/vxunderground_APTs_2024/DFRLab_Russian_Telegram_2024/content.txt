Summary of findings
General themes:
●	 In the more than two years since Russia began its full-
scale invasion of Ukraine, no platform has expanded 
its role in helping the outside world to understand the 
Russian perspective on the war more than Telegram. 
●	 Its influence was solidified in the first months of the 
war, as the Kremlin cracked down on Western social 
media platforms while continuing to tolerate Telegram 
and utilize it for its own purposes. 
●	 This propelled Telegram into one of the last remaining 
windows for observing and understanding Russian 
thinking about the war—from the general public to 
the Kremlin itself. 
Trends among top Russian Telegram 
channels:
●	 Analysis of the fifteen largest Russian Telegram chan-
nels showed the greatest spike in activity at the very 
start of the February 2022 invasion, followed by a 
spike during Yevgeny Prigozhin’s failed June 2023 
mutiny against the Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD).
●	 Additional spikes were consistent with local military 
developments ranging from the Ukrainian counter-
offensive in northeast Ukraine in the spring and fall 
of 2022, as well as Russia’s military advances in the 
cities of Soledar and Bakhmut in March of 2023.
●	 Russia’s fifteen most influential channels routinely 
reposted content from other influential Telegram 
channels, effectively creating an echo chamber for 
reinforcing overall Kremlin narratives. 
●	 Top channels experienced significant subscriber 
growth following the February 2022 invasion, but 
some of the most influential pro-war channels, such 
as Karaulny, Z SIL0VIKI, and WarGonzo, later experi-
enced declines that have continued into the spring of 
2024, perhaps due to war weariness.
●	 Top channels also experienced a vast jump in view-
ership, growing from nearly sixteen billion views in 
2021 to 95.5 billion over the course of 2022. In 2023 
viewership grew modestly to 109 billion views.
●	 Some of this growth can be accounted for by a hand-
ful of dominant channels. Between 2021 and 2023, 
state-owned news agency RIA Novosti nearly tripled 
its annual views, eventually garnering almost thirty bil-
lion views during 2023. Vladimir Solovyov’s audience 
on the Russia 1 channel increased twentyfold, achiev-
ing twenty billion views in 2023, while Readovka, a 
pro-Kremlin news site, achieved a ninety-onefold in-
crease, reaching 17.85 billion views in 2023.
Military blogger channels:
●	 A Digital Forensic Research Lab (DFRLab) analysis 
of more than 500,000 Telegram posts published by 
thirty-eight leading military blogger channels surfaced 
recurring topical themes, including frontline updates, 
such as activities by the Armed Forces of Ukraine 
(AFU) and its battlefield losses; narratives discussing 
the West’s dependence on Russian natural resources; 
Russian attacks on Ukrainian cities; and discussions 
denigrating Ukrainians as “Nazis.”
●	 During Ukraine’s successful September 2022 coun-
teroffensive in Kharkiv, and pro-Ukraine forces in-
filtration of Russia’s Belgorod region in May 2023, 
military bloggers’ posts fell into three categories: on-
the-ground frontline updates and analysis; mapping 
of losses/gains; and criticism of the Russian MoD and 
its management of the war. Posts related to these cat-
egories received more views and reposts than posts 
on other topics.
Private military company (PMC) channels:
●	 DFRLab analysis of channels affiliated with Russian 
private military companies (PMCs) identified three key 
areas of engagement: fundraising, recruiting, and in-
formation sharing.
●	 Channels collect money to buy tactical gear, medical 
supplies, firearms, and other equipment, relying on 
donations via Russian banks and cryptocurrencies. 
●	 Russian PMC channels used the platform to recruit 
additional fighters to their battalions, often employing 
patriotic and emotional messaging. 
●	 Wagner maintained at least thirty separate channels 
dedicated to regional recruitment offices. These, 
however, disappeared after Russian telecommuni-
cations regulator Roskomnadzor cracked down on 
Wagner channels during the mutiny.

ATLANTIC COUNCIL
●	 Russian PMC channels engage in widespread informa-
tion sharing on a variety of topics, such official Kremlin 
statements, current war footage, service awards, and 
disinformation narratives, including rumors about US 
biological weapons.
Russian hacktivist channels:
●	 The DFRLab identified four peaks in posting activity 
on Russian hacktivist channels, each of which pre-
ceded a notable hacking incident. Mentions of spe-
cific countries often spiked prior to these hacking 
incidents. Ukraine, the United States, and Poland re-
ceived the most mentions.
Russian media use of Telegram:
●	 Telegram’s increasing popularity in Russia was re-
flected in how Kremlin-controlled, pro-Kremlin, and 
independent Russian media outlets increasingly cite 
Telegram content as sources in their news articles.  
●	 An analysis of Telegram URLs showed a 481 percent 
increase in Telegram citations appearing in the arti-
cles of pro-Kremlin media outlets, jumping to 33,300 
citations by 2023. 
●	 Facebook and Instagram, both of which were banned 
by the Kremlin, experienced precipitous drops in 
news citations, while citations of X (formerly Twitter) 
dropped in 2022 and then increased in 2023, sug-
gesting the impact of the Kremlin ban was only tem-
porary. VKontakte (VK), a Russian social media app, 
experienced modest citation increases from 1,192 in 
2021 to 1,848 in 2023, but its numbers were no match 
for the Telegram citations, suggesting that VK is not 
seen as an important information source. 
Russian crackdown on anonymous channels:
●	 According to data from TGStat, a Telegram analytics 
platform, approximately half of the top one hundred 
Russian Telegram channels are anonymous.
●	 Some channels have embraced their anonymity as a 
branding tactic, presenting themselves as sources of 
insider information, adding to their appeal to readers.
●	 Anonymous channels targeted by the Kremlin are 
often accused of extortion by profiting off of “negative 
blocks,” in which a channel agrees to not mention a 
specific person or a company in a negative light in 
exchange for money. 
●	 Crackdowns on anonymous Telegram channels 
have been successful due to the development of 
data-collection methods that allow investigators to 
deanonymize channels. In the words of Russian MP 
Alexander Khinshtein, “Anonymity on TG is a myth.” 
Channels critical of the Kremlin:
●	 Despite efforts to identify channel administrators, 
Telegram maintains a robust community of actors ex-
posing Kremlin wrongdoings and criticizing Russia’s 
political and military elite on the messaging app. 
●	 One of the most popular Russian independent news 
outlets, Meduza, ranked seventeenth in subscribers 
among the top one hundred Russian news and media 
channels in Russia. 
●	 Outside of Russia, reputable Western daily newspa-
pers like The New York Times and The Washington 
Post have circumvented website bans by launching 
Telegram channels.
●	 Channels affiliated with the late Prigozhin and the 
Wagner Group became a significant threat to Kremlin 
messaging, climaxing with the June 2023 Wagner 
mutiny. 
●	 Wagner channels garnered more than 107 million 
views and 1.3 million shares over the two-day period, 
while Prigozhin’s primary channel, Prigozhin Press 
Service, grew by more than 872,000 subscribers.
Additional case studies:
●	 Russian Telegram groups engage in fundraising to en-
courage civilians to donate money for equipment pur-
chasing. Among the most successful fundraisers were 
campaigns promoted by propagandist and Telegram 
influencer Solovyov.
●	 Russian government ministries employ Telegram 
to recruit new soldiers, particularly in autonomous 
ethnic regions, while competing channels like Get 
Lost encourage Russian conscripts to avoid military 
service.

I
n the more than two years since Russia began its full-
scale invasion of Ukraine, no platform has expanded 
its role in helping the outside world to understand the 
Russian perspective on the war more than Telegram. 
Launched by Russian entrepreneur Pavel Durov in 2013, 
the messaging platform rapidly grew in popularity, even-
tually gaining primacy in Russian social media discourse. 
Its influence was solidified in the first months of the war, as 
the Kremlin cracked down on Western social media plat-
forms while continuing to tolerate Telegram and utilize it for 
its own purposes. This has propelled Telegram into one 
of the last remaining windows for observing and under-
standing Russian thinking about the war, from the gen-
eral public to the Kremlin itself. 
This growth was partially instigated as Telegram became 
more than a messaging app for Russian audiences. After 
multiple Western governments blocked access to Russian 
government-controlled and pro-government media web-
sites following the February 2022 invasion, many Russian 
media outlets started to actively use Telegram as a work-
around to disseminate and promote their content.1 The 
blocking of Western social media platforms by Russian 
authorities in 2022 also contributed to the growth of 
Telegram in Russia.2 
According to a 2023 report by the advertising division of 
Telegram analytics platform TGStat,3 the Russian segment 
of Telegram comprises more than seventy-five million 
users and hosts over 700,000 channels. The report high-
lighted that 85 percent of respondents rely on Telegram 
for news, while approximately half of Russian Telegram 
users subscribed to a channel about politics, and one in 
three users subscribed to channels covering the war in 
Ukraine. Additionally, a study by the Russian media holding 
company Rambler&Co found that the number of people in 
Russia using Telegram for news consumption is almost the 
same as the number of Russians visiting news websites for 
the same purpose.4 
Other pro-Kremlin actors have also expanded their pres-
ence on Telegram, contributing to the growth of the plat-
form’s pro-Kremlin disinformation ecosystem. In May 2022, 
the DFRLab found that pro-Kremlin content had become 
more prevalent on Telegram in Russia than content from 
independent and critical channels since the start of the 
war.5 Pro-Kremlin Telegram channels also registered faster 
subscriber growth and engagement on Telegram than 
channels critical or neutral toward the Kremlin. 
Shortly after the invasion, Russian authorities started to 
explicitly promote Telegram to domestic audiences. In 
March 2022, the Russian Ministry of Digital Development, 
Communications, and Mass Media advised government 
agencies to create accounts on Telegram and the Russian 
social network VKontakte (VK).6 Pro-Kremlin actors have 
leveraged Telegram to bring their messages to millions 
of Russians and serve as a primary vector to spread their 
messaging beyond Russia’s borders.7 
Russia’s weaponization of Telegram against Ukraine 
began prior to the invasion. In February 2021, the Security 
Services of Ukraine exposed a network of Telegram chan-
nels overseen by Russia’s Main Intelligence Directorate 
(GRU), arresting individuals who allegedly created and 
administered a number of political Telegram channels to 
incite social tensions and protests in Ukraine.8 During the 
first weeks of the invasion, Russian authorities blocked 
access to hundreds of Ukrainian websites in occupied 
Ukrainian territory; in parallel, more than one hundred 
pro-Kremlin Telegram channels appeared, operating as 
local media in occupied territories as well as broadcasting

messages coming from local Russia-backed separatist 
administrations.
Moscow also has cracked down on Russian Telegram 
channels critical of the Kremlin. Russian authorities have 
increasingly surveilled and prosecuted administrators of 
anonymous Telegram channels as well as journalists and 
dissidents, silencing or imprisoning those targeted.9
Overall, though, with the expansion of pro-Kremlin 
communities on Telegram, the messaging platform has

allowed for greater understanding of current Russian 
political dynamics regarding the war.10 For example, 
Russian military bloggers use Telegram to regularly re-
port about the situation on the frontlines; their messages 
are then amplified by Russian media outlets.11 Russian 
mercenary groups also use Telegram to recruit fighters, 
raise money for their units, and provide regular updates 
about their activities in Ukraine. Meanwhile, Russian 
hacker groups that target Ukraine and its allies routinely 
employ Telegram to coordinate their attacks and publi-
cize them.

U
nderstanding Telegram’s prominence in Russia 
requires a brief overview of the country’s infor-
mation ecosystem over the last three decades. In 
1990s Russia, the primary mass communications 
medium was television.12 Russia had a number of TV chan-
nels and media outlets, often backed by oligarchs, leading 
to a certain amount of competition and alternative points 
of view on current events.13 The situation started to change 
as Vladimir Putin consolidated power, tightening the leash 
on journalists and oligarchs, forcing them to express sup-
port for the “state’s cause” or end up either jailed, dead, 
or exiled.14 This change in the media landscape solidified 
the predominance of state-supported messaging across 
mainstream Russian media, pushing alternative points of 
view to outsider status.15 
The internet remained largely uncontrolled by the Kremlin 
during this period, but received increased attention after 
the 2011 protests in Moscow’s Bolotnaya Square, which 
was partially coordinated via the web and social media.16 At 
the time, the predominant social media in Russia were the 
blogging service LiveJournal and VK, a Russian copycat of 
Facebook created by Durov, who subsequently launched 
Telegram in 2013. During the 2014 Revolution of Dignity 
in Ukraine, Russian authorities pressed Durov to provide 
VK data regarding users participating in the protests in 
Ukraine. Pavel refused, which ultimately forced him to de-
part the company and sell his equity stake, leaving VK less 
resistant to Kremlin pressure. Subsequently, Russian tech 
firms like Yandex and Mail.ru, as well as media companies 
operating the largest news aggregators, became allied to 
or forced to coexist with the Kremlin and its interests.17
With the Kremlin influencing media narratives and the in-
formation space more broadly, alternative viewpoints were 
forced to the sidelines. This created an information vac-
uum that would ultimately be filled by Telegram channels. 
According to the outlet Proekt Media,  government officials 
tolerated the platform, as they could use it to selectively 
leak “insider information,” whether factual or otherwise, as 
well as track leaks by other officials.18
By 2018, Telegram was believed to have around 200,000 
active users in Russia.19 The popularity of Telegram in 
Russia increased after the failed attempt of the Russian 
Duma to block Telegram in Russia in 2017-18.20 Authorities 
tried to extract encryption keys from Durov; when he re-
fused, the Russian state started blocking access to the 
platform. While attempting to do so, Russian authorities 
wreaked havoc on domestic internet services: people 
could not receive verification messages to confirm banking 
operations; bank tellers couldn’t access internal systems to 
conduct operations; and some websites became unreach-
able.21 This made Telegram even more popular among 
users, who found work-arounds to access the platform, 
increasing its reach by 40 percent.22 
While Kremlin spokesperson Dmitri Peskov acknowledged 
that Telegram had been “blocked, but not banned,” it con-
tinued to function and thrive, even providing a platform for

Russian officials. Telegram bypassed government restric-
tions on the popular cloud platform Amazon Web Services, 
used by thousands of websites. This created issues for 
other sites after Russian telecommunications regulator 
Roskomnadzor banned millions of Amazon internet proto-
col (IP) addresses. Roskomnadzor also had to contend with 
how parts of Telegram’s infrastructure used Apple, Google, 
and Microsoft services, the blocking of which would have 
compromised domestic internet services even further.23 In 
2020, Roskomnadzor finally ceded its attempts to block the 
platform.24 Its reasons remain open to interpretation. One 
government source alleged to Russian media group RBK25 
that Durov still cooperated with the Kremlin; in a 2024 in-
terview, however, Durov pointed to Western competitors 
as likely spreading rumors of Kremlin control of Telegram.26
Meanwhile, the platform allowed political figures to publish 
kompromat (compromising materials) on their opponents, 
thus using it for political skirmishing. Some channels report-
edly took up the practice of blocking negative information

ernment and negative ones about its opponents, such as 
targeting Alexei Navalny in 2018.28 Moreover, a growing 
number of channels were connected to Russian authorities 
and oligarchs, publishing content in step with the central 
government. 
Russian propagandists also joined the network, launch-
ing their own channels to share Kremlin-aligned narra-
tives alongside their own thoughts. The platform currently 
hosts the personal channels of RT Editor-in-Chief Margarita 
Simonyan,29 TV propagandist Solovyov,30 and multiple 
journalists from pro-Kremlin and Kremlin-owned outlets. 
Notably, these channels cultivated broader networks of 
like-minded channels, creating lists of channels they read 
and nudging readers to subscribe.

o better understand Russian Telegram and how 
pro-war Russian influencers operate on the plat-
form, the DFRLab analyzed the fifteen most influ-
ential Russian Telegram channels, conducted a 
deeper examination of three influential communities on 
Russian Telegram—including Russian military bloggers, pri-
vate military companies (PMCs), and pro-Russian hackers—
and examined the platform’s influence on Russian media 
outlets. Using a combination of qualitative open-source re-
search and quantitative data analysis, we examined how 
these communities operate on Telegram, the key topics 
discussed, and how they are amplified by pro-Kremlin ac-
tors to the wider Telegram ecosystem. 
The primary challenge faced during our research was 
contending with the fact that no monitoring tool exists for 
retrieving and analyzing content published across the en-
tire Telegram ecosystem. Unlike many other social media 
platforms which have corresponding monitoring tools for 
analyzing their entire public archives, Telegram monitor-
ing products require some form of curation to supply them 
with lists of Telegram channels, which they then archive 
and analyze. For example, as of March 6, 2024, TGStat 
tracked approximately 853,000 Russian channels. While 
this dataset is quite expansive, it represents what is ef-
fectively the known universe of Russian Telegram chan-
nels, leaving the true size of the entire universe of Russian 
Telegram an open question. 
Nonetheless, TGStat’s database of 853,000 Russian 
Telegram channels serves as an extremely useful starting 
point for researchers, including identifying the fifteen most 
influential channels, which is defined by the number of cita-
tions and reposts per Telegram channel. The DFRLab then 
collected nearly one million messages from the fifteen 
channels over a period spanning from December 1, 2021, 
until February 19, 2024. The DFRLab aggregated posts by 
week to visualize the number of messages each channel 
posted over the course of the observed period. 
Separately, the DFRLab also collected Russian Telegram 
data focusing on three communities: Russian military 
bloggers, or milbloggers, who serve as primary sources of 
reporting and analysis regarding the Russian invasion of 
Ukraine; private military companies (PMCs) that maintain a 
presence on the platform; and Russian hacker groups that 
use Telegram to coordinate and promote their activities.  
Channels belonging to military bloggers were initially cu-
rated from the Alliance for Securing Democracy’s Russian 
Military Bloggers Dashboard, while channels owned by 
mercenary groups and pro-Kremlin hackers were identified 
by the DFRLab via TGStat queries and ongoing DFRLab 
monitoring and analysis of the platform over a period of 
more than two years.31 This resulted in the analysis of 
eighty-four channels, including thirty-eight military blogger 
channels, fifteen PMC channels, and twenty-nine hacker 
channels.
Once the DFRLab identified these channels, we scraped 
737,699 Telegram posts published by these communities 
published between February 24, 2022, and October 29, 
2023, using the statistical modeling technique known as 
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers 
(BERTopic) to identify representative topics by analyzing 
clusters of similar words.32 Given that this methodology 
focuses on analyzing written text, the Telegram messages 
were then sorted to remove posts lacking text or interpre-
table language, resulting in 502,575 messages that could 
be parsed for topic modeling. 
To render the messages, the DFRLab utilized disti-
luse-base-multilingual-cased-v2, a pretrained sentence 
transformer tool developed by the company Hugging 
Face, which was selected after a thorough testing of sev-
eral other tools compatible with Russian-language text.33 
We then used BERTopic to fine-tune keyword word repre-
sentations for each topic, allowing us to identify the most 
common topics discussed across each Telegram commu-
nity during the analyzed timeframe. 
We also prepared social network maps to examine how 
channels within the three communities amplify each other, 
and how they are amplified by outside channels. This was 
accomplished by creating an internal network visualization 
based on the backbone approach, a methodology for ana-
lyzing the relative intensity of connections, or edges, within 
a network.34 Network graph data was generated in the pro-
gramming language R, using the R library igraph and its

implementation of the PageRank algorithm to compute the 
relative importance, or centrality, of the Telegram chan-
nels in each network.35 The results were then visualized 
using the network mapping tool Gephi and its ForceAtlas2 
algorithm.36
Lastly, we conducted additional analysis to examine how 
the Russian media ecosystem utilizes Telegram as a pri-
mary source in its reporting and vice versa. We selected 
ten media outlets prominent on the platform, including 
seven pro-Kremlin outlets and three independent out-
lets, using the media monitoring platform Event Registry 
to scrape 655,165 articles published during the periods

Overview of mainstream Russian Telegram
T
he DFRLab compiled a list of the fifteen most influ-
ential Telegram channels according to TGStat, as 
determined by the total amount of citations and 
reposts per Telegram channel. These included 
channels ranging from bloggers like Russian propagan-
dist Solovyov to the Russian Defense Ministry and Russian 
state media like TASS, RIA Novosti, and Russia Today. In 
total, the top fifteen channels garnered more than sixteen 
million subscribers.
To better understand the messaging and posting patterns 
of the selected channels as related to the war in Ukraine, 
we analyzed a total of 978,220 posts published between 
December 1, 2021—approximately ten weeks prior to 
the February 2022 invasion—and February 19, 2024. 
Unsurprisingly, the largest surge of messages across the 
channels occurred on February 24, 2022, the beginning 
of Russia’s full-scale invasion. Subsequent spikes were 
consistent with local military developments ranging from 
the Ukrainian counteroffensive in northeast Ukraine in 
the spring and fall of 2022, as well as Russia’s military ad-
vances in the cities of Soledar and Bakhmut in March of 
2023. 
Notably, the DFRLab also observed that the second big-
gest surge in messages stemmed from Prigozhin’s failed 
mutiny against the MoD on June 23, 2023. These findings 
were consistent with prior DFRLab research documenting 
the role of Telegram channels in the mutiny.
To explore how the top fifteen channels promoted the 
Russian Telegram ecosystem more broadly, the DFRLab 
aggregated all of their posts originating from other chan-
nels. In total, the fifteen channels reposted content from 
approximately 4,000 channels, including each other, al-
lowing us to document significant narrative overlap across 
Russian Telegram, in particular the exceptional outreach of 
state media and key Russian propagandists.

ATLANTIC COUNCIL
The top fifteen channels routinely reposted the content 
of Russia’s one hundred most popular Telegram chan-
nels, effectively creating an echo chamber for reinforcing 
popular Russian narratives. Overall, the top fifteen chan-
nels’ reposting pattern showed the strongest connections 
with those categorized by TGStat as “blogs” or “politics,” 
significantly impacting the flow of information within the 
network. The six  most-cited channels were Karaulny Z, a 
pro-war news channel; Besposchadny Piarschik (“Ruthless 
PR Man”), a channel about media and PR; RT in Russia; 
RT’s editor-in-chief, Simonyan; SIL0VIKI, a news channel 
that discusses Russian politics; and WarGonzo, a popular 
milblogger channel run by Semyon Pegov.
All six of these channels experienced significant subscriber 
growth following the February 2022 invasion, according 
to data from TGStat. However, three of the six—Karaulny, 
SIL0VIKI, and WarGonzo—eventually experienced declines 
that have continued into the spring of 2024, which the 
technology outlet Fast Company speculated was due to 
increased Russian weariness about the war. WarGonzo, 
for example, quintupled its pre-invasion audience in the 
first three months of the war, reaching a plateau of more 
than 1.3 million subscribers in November 2022 before be-
ginning a decline that would shed one-quarter million fol-
lowers by late March 2024. 
Similar to their post-invasion jump in subscribers was a 
vast jump in viewership, which accounts for the total num-
ber of times their content has been seen by Telegram 
users, whether they subscribe to the channel or not. The

DFRLab aggregated the number of views per channel for 
each year, starting in 2020. In 2021, for example, the chan-
nels garnered nearly sixteen billion views, up from more 
than ten billion in 2020. Total views then began to sky-
rocket after the February 2022 invasion, reaching 95.5 
billion views by the end of the year. Viewership rose by 
approximately 10 percent in 2023 to just under 109 billion 
views—a sizeable, but much less dramatic increase than 
the post-invasion period in 2022
Some of this growth can be accounted for by some of 
the most popular channels, including the news outlet RIA 
Novosti, propagandist Solovyov, and the outlet Readovka 
News. RIA Novosti nearly tripled its annual views, even-
tually garnering almost thirty billion views during 2023. 
Solovyov’s audience experienced a twentyfold increase, 
surpassing twenty billion views in 2023. Readovka 
achieved the most impressive viewership growth: a ninety- 
onefold increase to 17.85 billion views in 2023.

more from Telegram than Russian military blog-
gers, also known as milbloggers or voenkory, a 
portmanteau of the Russian words for “war correspon-

and wide: according to data from the Alliance for Securing 
Democracy at the German Marshall Fund, military bloggers 
amassed more than seventeen billion views in the three-
month period from May to July 2023.
The milblogger community on Telegram comprises an 
array of voices, all sharing a pro-Russia, pro-war perspec-
tive. Along with actual war correspondents, this includes

a notable cadre of influential Kremlin-adjacent figures and 
military experts.37 There are also anonymous channels 
promoting hawkish sentiments, many of which utilize the 
letter Z, which quickly emerged as a pro-war symbol after 
the start of the 2022 invasion, in their channel names and 
logos.38
Military bloggers typically present themselves as military 
experts and often claim to have direct access to Russian 
military forces. Some are embedded with these forces, 
while others seem to actively participate in combat, thus 
offering unique on-the-ground reporting.  As previously 
noted, milbloggers are generally supportive of the war 
against Ukraine, but they occasionally venture into cri-
tiques of the war’s management.39 Direct criticism of Putin 
is rare, however; in one notable exception, milbloggers 
harshly criticized Putin’s decision to announce a ceasefire 
over Orthodox Christmas in 2023.40
Some observers speculate that the Kremlin tolerates such 
criticism not only because certain military bloggers have 
powerful connections in Moscow, but also because their 
channels serve as useful venting mechanisms for national-
ists to complain over the failures in Ukraine.41 The extent of 
military bloggers’ association with the government varies. 
However, since December 2022, some have participated 
in a task force established by Putin to advise on mobiliza-
tion-related issues.42 The task force features some of the 
most popular military bloggers, including the aforemen-
tioned War Gonzo, as well as Rybar and Poddubnyy ZOV. 
The DFRLab analyzed the activity of thirty-eight of the larg-
est milblogger channels to identify broad topical trends 
throughout the observation window of February 24, 2022, 
to October 29, 2023. Our analysis of 513,460 Telegram

situation on the frontline, including documenting activities 
by the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) and its battlefield 
losses. Telegram channels also heavily featured narratives 
discussing the West’s dependence on Russian natural re-
sources, including oil and gas. Military bloggers routinely 
reported on Russian attacks on Ukrainian cities and the 
explosions resulting from it; they also often referred to 
Ukrainians as Nazis. 
While Russia and Ukraine dominated discussions on mil-
blogger channels, topic modeling also showed that posts 
in these channels covered countries in Russia’s wider 
neighborhood, as well as in Africa. For example, posts 
about Armenia mainly contained criticism of Prime Minister 
Nikol Pashinyan, including his response to Azerbaijan’s 
September 2023 Nagorno-Karabakh military operation.43 
In contrast, posts about Iran highlighted Russia-Iran rela-
tions in a positive light, with a particular emphasis on the 
flow of Iranian weapons systems into Russia.
Meanwhile, milbloggers focused on West Africa and the 
Sahel region—in particular, Nigeria, Mali, and Burkina Faso. 
More specifically, posts about these countries discussed 
their fight against terrorism and the presence of the Wagner 
Group in the region. These posts also portrayed France 
and its engagement with Sahel countries in a negative light.

To gain insight on how milbloggers sometimes use a plat-

counteroffensive in Kharkiv, and pro-Ukraine forces infil-
tration of Russia’s Belgorod region in May 2023.44 For both

events, we analyzed a three-day observation window to 
understand their initial reactions and how their comments 
evolved as more information became available. In total, the 
thirty-eight milboggers published 6,423 posts over the two 
observation windows.
During both event windows, most of their posts could be 
divided into three categories: frontline updates based on 
their own reporting or information provided by those on-
the-ground; analysis and mapping of losses/gains; and crit-
icism of the Russian MoD and its management of the war. 
Posts falling into one of these three categories also reso-
nated with Telegram users more than posts on other topics 
when measured by the number of views and reposts. 
Regarding the Ukrainian counteroffensive in Kharkiv, from 
September 6 to 9, 2022, the thirty-eight milbloggers pub-
lished a total of 3,405 posts. The most active channel, 
Rybar is one of the most popular channels on Russian 
Telegram; with 1.2 million subscribers as of March 2024, 
Rybar’s popularity is on par with the channels of some of 
Telegram’s largest Kremlin-linked influencers, including 
Solovyov and former Russian President Dmitri Medvedev. 
Rybar’s high level of activity can be attributed to its pub-
lishing of news updates, providing its audience with videos 
and maps explaining the evolving situation on the ground.

Elsewhere on Telegram, milbloggers showcased Ukrainian 
losses, in particular military equipment from Western 
sources. The channel Operatsiya Z: Voenkory Russkoy 
Vesny (Operation Z: Military Correspondents of the Russian 
Spring) posted videos of equipment losses while claiming 
Ukrainians had run out of their own military equipment and 
were now mostly using Western supplies. Elsewhere, the 
channel Dva Mayora (Two Majors) posted a long critique of 
Russian authorities that centered on “the underestimation 
of the opponent and flawed assessment of the situation.” 
They accused the MoD of poor planning, highlighting lo-
gistics issues and the inability of its leaders to engage in 
strong decision-making. Regarding the latter, the channel 
also warned of the dangers of these decision-makers be-
lieving their “special military operation” in Ukraine was 
going according to plan. “Even going on a defensive?” the 
channel asked sarcastically. 
Other milbloggers lambasted the Russian army, its leader-
ship, and even the Kremlin for military failures. Igor Girkin, a 
far-right nationalist and former Russian intelligence colonel 
who previously commanded pro-Russian separatist forces 
in 2014, said on a Telegram video that the war in Ukraine 
will go on until Russia is ultimately defeated, claiming 
that the war was already lost. (Girkin was later arrested in 
July 2023.)45 Meanwhile, milblogger and Komsomolskaya

Pravda reporter Aleksandr Kots accused Russian authori-
ties of concealing negative developments concerning the 
deteriorating situation in Kharkiv. He emphasized the need 
to change the current system in which Russian leadership 
avoids discussing unfavorable news and their subordi-
nates are reluctant to upset their superiors.
Milbloggers engaged in similar posting behavior in May 
2023, when Russia’s Belgorod region was attacked by an-
ti-Kremlin Russian forces. Two Russian factions active in 
Ukraine, the Russian Volunteer Corps (RVC) and Freedom 
of Russia Legion, claimed accountability for the incursion. 
Kyiv framed the raid as a manifestation of domestic discord 
within Russia, noting that Russian citizens had carried out 
the attack.46
Milbloggers published 3,018 posts between May 22 to 
25, 2023, which once again could be divided in the same 
three categories as during the Kharkiv counteroffensive:

news updates, analysis of gains/losses, and criticism of 
Russian officials. 
On May 22, the channel ARKHANGEL SPETSNAZA Z 
(ARCHANGEL SWAT TEAM Z) posted a conversation al-
legedly held with Russian opposition fighters in Belgorod, 
describing how they were trying to reach a particular 
checkpoint and were under attack. Posts such as these 
often resonate among Telegram audiences, as they pro-
vide alleged firsthand information unavailable through 
other Russian news sources; in this particular instance, the 
post accumulated more than 1.3 million views.  Meanwhile, 
on his channel Colonelcassad, Kremlin military commen-
tator Boris Rozhin posted photos on the second day of 
the raid and alleged that attackers had utilized US military 
equipment.
Milbloggers also criticized the MoD’s conducting of the 
war. The channel Povornutyye na Z voyne (Turned on Z

war) posted a lengthy text from an alleged eyewitness 
in Belgorod who described inadequate communication 
systems between units, ineffective leadership at higher 
levels, and outdated methods in planning and execution. 
Alexander Kots, meanwhile, called out pro-Kremlin pun-
dits who had dismissed military bloggers’ warnings of 
such incidents as “hysteria.” He questioned Russia’s de-
fensive and surveillance capabilities, asking, “Why did the 
enemy armored group calmly penetrate deep into our 
territory?” The two posts received more than 2.4 million 
views combined.
Though Russian military bloggers occasionally criticize the 
conduct of the war, they remain supportive of the war’s 
aims. Their mix of criticism and firsthand reporting have 
made them extremely popular among Russian Telegram 
users, who see their efforts as trustworthy and balanced, 
especially in comparison to state media sources.

Assault Reconnaissance Group, DSHRG Rusich, or simply 
Rusich, was founded in 2014 by Alexey Yurevich Milchakov

include a contingent of neo-Nazis,51 have a reputation of

Russian PMCs use Telegram for several purposes. The 
DFRLab utilized algorithm-backed topic modeling to iden-
tify three key areas of engagement: fundraising, recruit-
ing, and information sharing.

Russian PMCs actively use Telegram to collect money from 
supporters. This includes basic methods such as provid-

to bypass sanctions, including cryptocurrency wallet 
addresses.
A review of fundraising-related posts suggests channels 
collect money to buy tactical gear, medical supplies, fire-
arms, and other equipment. They rely on Russian banks, 
using the58 of Alfa-Bank, Sberbank,59 VTB Bank, and 
Russian National Commercial Bank. Purchase lists60 and 
traditional donation requests dominate the channels linked 
to Wagner and Task Force Rusich. 
To raise money via cryptocurrencies, PMCs share their wal-
let addresses with donors. DFRLab found groups request-
ing cryptocurrency in Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litcoin 
(LTC), Monero (XRM), and Tether (USDT). Channel members 
were generally more likely to share posts about cryptocur-
rency fundraisers than posts with traditional bank accounts, 
though Rodyna channels proved to be an exception.
The analyzed channels posted at least fourteen different 
cryptocurrency addresses, with Bitcoin and Tether receiv-
ing the most mentions.

Prior to the June 2023 mutiny, Wagner maintained at least 
thirty separate channels dedicated to regional recruitment 
offices. These, however, disappeared after Russian tele-
communications regulator Roskomnadzor cracked down 
on Wagner channels during the mutiny. Other Wagner 
channels promoted72 recruitment announcements of 
hacker groups, including Killnet and Legion.73 
Compared with other PMCs, Task Force Rusich74 did not 
publish many recruitment posts,75 more often promoting 
basic military training classes instead; these would then 
be deleted.

P
ro-Russian hacktivist groups became more active 
after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. Although 
such attacks were by no means new, their use of 
Telegram has provided additional insight and con-
text regarding these attacks.
According to Intel471, a cyber threat intelligence company, 
pro-Russian hacktivists commonly target89 Ukraine and the 
West through distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. 
They also engage in other acts, including phishing, website 
defacement, network breaches, data exfiltration, and dox-
ing government and military officials by publicly revealing 
their personally identifiable information. 
The DFRLab analyzed 60,868 Telegram posts by twen-
ty-nine 
pro-Russian 
hacktivists 
published 
between 
February 24, 2022, and October 1, 2023. We identified four 
peaks in posting activity, during which channels posted 
more than one thousand messages for each peak. These 
peaks occurred between July 4-11, 2022; October 17-22, 
2022; November 7-14, 2022; and September 4-11, 2023.
Overall, channel activity generally focused on frontline 
updates, political developments in Western countries, and 
plans for DDoS attacks. Our analysis of the posts demon-
strated that hacking attacks often took place in retaliation 
for Western governments engaging in embargoes or sup-
plying weaponry. For example, in June 2022, Killnet, one 
of the largest pro-Russia hacker groups, conducted DDoS 
attacks against the Lithuanian government after Lithuania 
blocked the transit of goods and supplies to the Russian 
exclave of Kaliningrad.90 The following month, another 
hacktivist group, NoName057(16), took responsibility for 
attacks against Lithuania’s strategic assets, including air-
ports, ports, and private logistics companies, as Lithuania 
had not lifted the transit ban.
An October 2022 spike in Telegram activity aligned with a 
series of DDoS attacks directed at Ukrainian infrastructure. 
The DFRLab identified at least ten targets of pro-Russia 
hacktivists in Ukraine between October 17 and October 
23. Hackers claimed responsibility for online attacks on 
various entities, including the Kyiv military lyceum,91 the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs,92 the Parkovyi data center,93

often linked to specific hacking efforts, with channels dis-
seminating information-targeted websites and institutions. 
Notably, mentions of specific countries often spiked prior 
to these hacking incidents. 
Between February 24, 2022, and October 1, 2023, Ukraine

linked102 the attack to Polish parliamentary elections. The 
channel claimed that the Kaczyński government, as well as 
Donald Tusk (the centrist candidate who is now prime min-
ister), were “soaked” with Russophobia and that “Anglo-
Saxons” were instrumentalizing Polish Russophobia. This 
post was followed by DDoS attacks targeting the Polish 
Supreme Court, ports, and transportation infrastructure.
Types of infrastructure targeted
The DFRLab also analyzed targeted infrastructure by 
keyword, which were in turn categorized by sector. We 
determined that hacktivist Telegram channels primarily fo-
cused on civilian infrastructure rather than military targets. 
The most commonly referenced sector was the financial 
industry, which the channels discussed in the context of

Use of Telegram content by Russian media 
outlets in their news reporting 
B
eyond its use as a platform for Russian influenc-
ers and like-minded communities, Telegram has 
solidified its role in Russia as a daily news source. 
According to an April 2023 study conducted by 
the media research company Media Scope, 41 percent of 
Russians use Telegram daily, while 60 percent use it at 
least once a month. 
Furthermore, a September 2023 survey carried out by 
the media holding group Rambler&Co revealed that the 
proportion of surveyed Russian internet users who read 
news exclusively on Telegram is nearly equal to those who 
exclusively frequent news websites—25 percent versus 
27 percent, respectively—while an additional 48 percent 
of respondents rely on both mediums depending on the 
specific news topic. Consequently, the survey results sug-
gest that Telegram and media outlets garner nearly equal 
interest among the Russian audience when it comes to 
accessing news. 
This chapter explores how Telegram’s increasing popularity 
in Russia is reflected in how Kremlin-controlled, pro-Krem-
lin, and independent Russian media outlets increasingly 
cite Telegram content as sources in their news articles. The 
DFRLab identified seven Kremlin-controlled and pro-Krem-
lin Russian language media outlets that ranked among

citations in Brand Analytics112 and Medialogia113 rankings: 
Ria Novosti, RT in Russian, Lenta, Gazeta.ru, Izvestia, 
Rossiyskaya Gazeta, and Argumenti i Fakty. As a compari-
son, we also collected Telegram source citations by three 
popular independent media outlets: Meduza, The Insider, 
and The Moscow Times.
After selecting the ten media outlets, the DFRLab employed 
media-monitoring tool Event Registry to scrape 655,165 ar-
ticles published by these outlets over a three-month win-
dow from June 1 to August 31 for the years 2021, 2022, and 
2023. This resulted in 192,330 articles for the summer of 
2021, 224,195 articles for the summer of 2022, and 238,640 
for the summer of 2023. Once collected, we then identified 
which articles included links to Telegram content, resulting 
in a total of 60,070 hyperlinks pointing back to the platform.
An analysis of Telegram URLs showed a significant in-
crease of Telegram content appearing in the articles of 
pro-Kremlin media outlets, jumping from 6,026 citations in 
2021 to 33,300 citations in 2023—a 481 percent increase.

the total publishing output of all of these outlets only in-

cians received more than 5,700 media citations. Also in the 
top twenty-five were four Telegram channels of Russian-

Lastly, a channel run by the Ukrainian media outlet Strana.

The DFRLab also analyzed the extent to which Russian 
media outlets cited content from social media platforms. 
To that end, we collected URLs linking to Facebook, 
Instagram, Twitter/X, YouTube, and the Russian social net-
work VK. As previously noted, Facebook, Instagram, and X 
were blocked by Russian authorities shortly after Russia’s 
reinvasion of Ukraine in February 2022, while YouTube re-

Facebook experienced a precipitous drop in news cita-
tions, from 900 in 2021 to 18 in 2022 and 2023 combined, 
while Instagram fell from 1,154 to 13 over the same period. 
X also dropped from 2,469 citations in 2021 to 742 in 
2022, yet rose to 2,603 citations in 2023, suggesting the 
impact of the Kremlin ban was only temporary. YouTube, 
which has not been banned, trended similarly to X, drop-
ping from 2,713 citations in 2021 to 1,902 in 2022, then 
rising to 3,083 in 2023. And while VK experienced modest 
citation increases from 1,192 in 2021 to 1,848 in 2023, its 
numbers were no match for the Telegram citations, sug-
gesting the former is not seen as an important information 
source compared to the latter.

A
ccording to TGStat data, approximately half 
of the top one hundred Russian Telegram 
channels are anonymous.116 A key factor like-
ly contributing to the popularity of anonymous 
channels is the Kremlin’s ongoing assault on free speech 
and independent media.117 This has also allowed some 
channels to embrace their anonymity as a branding tactic, 
presenting themselves as sources of insider information, 
adding to their appeal for readers.118
As Telegram’s popularity and trust in Russia have grown 
since the reinvasion, reports of surveillance and attempts 
by Russian law enforcement agencies to censor channel 
administrators have also increased, including reports of 
Russian citizens being fined or imprisoned for their activi-
ties on the platform.
In March 2023, a joint investigation by independent 
Russian outlets Meduza119 and The Bell120 revealed that 
Russian authorities had pursued authors of anonymous 
Telegram channels at the urging of Rostec, a Russian 
state corporation and defense contractor.121 Starting in the 
summer of 2022, Russia began launching criminal cases 
against administrators of anonymous Telegram channels 
en masse, accusing them of extortion by profiting off of 
“negative blocks,” in which a channel agrees to not men-
tion a specific person or a company in a negative light in 
exchange for money. Negative blocks are believed to be 
a common practice among Russian Telegram channels, 
however.122 In 2023, Simonyan admitted to making monthly 
payments to ensure that nothing unlikable about her or her 
family members is published. She claimed that this practice 
is “the usual business” in Russia, asserting that everyone 
does it and is aware of it.123
One notable incident was the hunt for anonymous admin-
istrators of celebrity news channel Tushite Svet (Turn out 
the Lights). Russian law enforcement agencies opened a 
case against them after they posted about a birthday cel-
ebration attended by a Rostec executive, despite having 
extorted the company for a negative block.
According to the investigation, Rostec employs software 
to deanonymize Telegram users, including administrators. 
The software, known as Hunter, reportedly examines open-
source data on social media, forums, government services, 
and other platforms, cataloging dozens of personal iden-
tifiers, including nicknames, email addresses, phone num-
bers, registered internet domains, and crypto wallets. In 
some instances, Rostec reportedly took control of popular 
Telegram channels that were once critical of the corpora-
tion and the Russian government. 
An additional investigation124 by The New York Times 
found that the Kremlin doubled down on surveillance 
tools to hunt down opponents of Russia’s war in Ukraine. 
It reported that Russia’s Federal Security Service (widely 
known as the FSB) is equipped with technologies that 
allow it to watch specific types of activities on encrypted 
apps like Telegram and identify anonymous social media 
users, among other things.
Multiple Russian journalists and dissidents have discov-
ered over the last year that their Telegram accounts were 
compromised or monitored, with their Telegram activity 
used against them in criminal cases. WIRED reported125 
several instances of Russian authorities appearing to have 
read the content of Telegram private chats, while Russian 
independent outlet Novaya Gazeta investigated126 similar 
Another Battlefield: Telegram as a digital front in Russia’s war against Ukraine

ATLANTIC COUNCIL
cases of deanonymization of Telegram channels posting 
about wrongdoings of Russian authorities and targeting 
the administrators with criminal charges.
In another investigation into deanonymization, a Russian 
online outlet Daily Storm discussed127 techniques used to 
expose user identities, including employing Telegram bots 
to reveal a channel’s links to other platforms, purchasing 
consumer internet data, phishing, and social engineering.
In October 2022, against the backdrop of arrests128 of ad-
ministrators of Telegram channels based on a lead provided 
by Rostec leadership, Russian MP Alexander Khinshtein,

W
hile the Kremlin and their allies have ex-
ploited Telegram for disseminating disin-
formation and propaganda, it’s not only 
Kremlin-approved channels that are avail-
able to the Russian audience. Telegram also contains a 
robust community of actors exposing Kremlin wrongdoings 
and criticizing Russia’s political and military elite on the 
messaging app. 
Various Russian independent media and investigative out-
lets have a presence on Telegram. With Moscow designat-
ing a large number of media and organizations as “foreign 
agents”133 and creating an unsafe environment for them to 
operate, Telegram became an important tool for them to 
disseminate their reporting without interference. At the time 
of writing in late March 2024, one of the famous Russian 
independent news outlets, Meduza, ranked seventeenth 
in subscribers among the top hundred news and media 
channels in Russia, according to TGStat data.134 Moscow 
designated Meduza as a “foreign agent” in 2021.135
Soon after the reinvasion, reputable Western daily news-
papers like The New York Times136 and Washington Post137 
also launched Telegram channels with the purpose of 
delivering news on the war to Russian audiences. The 
decision to establish a presence on the messaging app 
was prompted by Russia’s move to ban and block138 some 
Western online platforms139 and its ongoing efforts to si-
lence140 others. 
Additionally, Telegram channels that are generally sup-
portive of Kremlin foreign policy, including pro-war military 
bloggers,141 have used the platform to challenge the offi-
cial Kremlin narrative and criticize the Kremlin’s handling 
of the war. These criticisms became more commonplace 
during the second half of 2022 and included topics such 
as military incompetence, tactical failures, Putin’s Orthodox 
Christmas ceasefire,142 and Russia’s resumption of the grain 
deal with Ukraine, among other topics.143
Perhaps the most unfavorable Telegram development for 
the Kremlin unfolded in the lead-up to Prigozhin’s June 
2023 Wagner mutiny, as well as during the mutiny itself. 
An extremely active member of the platform, Prigozhin en-
gaged in rhetorical warfare against his foes in the Kremlin, 
specifically Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and 
Armed Forces Chief of Staff Gen. Valery Gerasimov. The 
Wagner chief accused them of being incompetent and not 
providing Wagner soldiers enough ammunition to fight in 
Ukraine. 
Immediately prior to launching the mutiny on June 23, 
Prigozhin released a series of Telegram posts accusing 
Russia’s military leadership of deceiving Russians and 
Putin, effectively bypassing the state-controlled media 
ecosystem to promote his message.144 He then used his 
Telegram channel, Prigozhin Press Service, to declare 
war against the Ministry of Defense in a Telegram audio 
clip.

Over the course of June 23 and 24, Prigozhin Press Service 
published twenty-six posts, including audio, video, images, 
and text. Collectively, the posts garnered more than 107 
million views and 1.3 million shares over the two-day pe-
riod. The DFRLab also found that subscribership increased 
sharply for Telegram channels whose names included ref-
erences to Prigozhin or Wagner Group during the period of 
June 22-29, with Prigozhin Press Service growing by more 
than 872,000 subscribers.145
As Prigozhin employed Telegram to promote his activities 
and goals throughout the mutiny, the Kremlin attempted 
to limit access to online information connected to him and 
the Wagner Group. This effort included content blocking

S
ince February 2022, Russian MoD-affiliated securi-
ty companies and state ministries have conducted 
recruitment campaigns via Telegram. These cam-
paigns aim to replenish frontline forces by promot-
ing contractual recruitment for soldiers. This included efforts 
to expand Wagner units prior to the June 2023 mutiny. 
These campaigns have been part of Russia’s broader ef-
fort to digitize MoD recruitment infrastructure, including the 
recruitment of contract soldiers and drone operators using 
its information portal Объясняем.РФ (WeExplain.rf).154 The 
platform utilizes regional Telegram channels to repost its 
contract offers and reach audiences in Russian regions, 
including in local minority languages.155 The DFRLab also 
identified Telegram recruitment ads encouraging men 
to enroll in Russia’s national guard,156 including former 
Wagner soldiers.157
Simultaneously, Telegram has increasingly served as a 
gateway for Russian citizens seeking to avoid conscription. 
One Telegram initiative known as Get Lost helps Russian 
men avoid the draft and emigrate from Russia. Between 
December 2022 and December 2023, the channel grew 
from around 19,000 subscribers to more than 82,000, ex-
periencing a surge in April 2023, following the signing of 
a bill enabling conscription summonses to be sent elec-
tronically. At the time of writing in March 2024, the channel 
featured more than 92,000 subscribers.158

Some Telegram channels also track reports of Russian 
casualties. For example, the DFRLab analyzed reports 
of Russian soldiers allegedly killed in action via a chan-
nel called Don’t wait for me FROM Ukraine. Out of 23,217 
posts analyzed by DFRLab, we assessed that 19,377 of 
them reported on the death of Russian soldiers. Although 
we could not identify the administrators of the channel, 
the mere existence of such channels can be interpreted 
as an effort to dissuade Russian enlistment and demoralize 
Russian Telegram users.

Conclusion
S
ince Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 
February 2022, Telegram has become one of 
the most important sources of information about 
the war for audiences in Russia, Ukraine, and be-
yond. Even though Telegram had been a popular mes-
saging app prior to February 2022, the remarkable rise 
of Telegram as a pivotal actor in Russia is closely linked 
to Russian war efforts. Following unsuccessful attempts 
of Russian authorities to effectively block Telegram in the 
country, pro-Kremlin actors in Russia started to actively em-
brace the messaging app to promote their narratives. The 
Kremlin’s decision to block Western online platforms also 
contributed to growing utilization of the messaging app to 
share information, spread propaganda, and organize ef-
forts in support of the war. 
Telegram has evolved beyond a mere messaging app, serv-
ing as a primary source for news consumption for a signif-
icant portion of the Russian population. Pro-Kremlin actors 
have capitalized on this shift, contributing to the growth of 
a pro-Kremlin information ecosystem on Telegram. On top 
of this, pro-Kremlin communities have amassed large au-
diences on Telegram, reinforcing Russia’s efforts to shape 
perceptions of millions of domestic Telegram users. Russian 
independent media outlets and other independent sources 
have also found Telegram to be a suitable environment to 
operate, reaching both domestic and foreign audiences. 
Even though Telegram positions itself as a censorship-free 
platform, the available evidence demonstrates how the 
service is not a completely safe place for critics of the 
Russian government. Although Telegram says it offers a 
high level of anonymity to channel administrators, public 
reports have shown that Russian authorities can identify 
operators of anonymous channels and prosecute them. 
The Kremlin’s use of surveillance systems to target ad-
ministrators of anonymous Telegram channels, journalists, 
and dissidents has led to increased level of censorship, 
imprisonment, and suppression of voices critical of state 
policies. Nevertheless, various independent voices con-
tinue to expose Kremlin’s wrongdoings on Telegram at the 
cost of their own personal safety.
The war in Ukraine has also sparked greater interest in 
Telegram as a source of eyewitness footage and report-
ing from the frontline. Available opinion polls show that 
Telegram is increasingly used by Russians as a news 
source. DFRLab research also revealed that Russian media 
outlets are increasingly relying on sourcing materials from 
Telegram. All of this suggests that the role of Telegram in 
the Russian media ecosystem will continue to grow. 
The surge in the popularity of loosely moderated messag-
ing apps like Telegram introduces a landscape fraught with 
both threats and opportunities, particularly during times of 
conflict. The threats are evident in the use of these plat-
forms for the dissemination of propaganda and disinforma-
tion, recruitment and fundraising activities, and even the 
coordination of cyberattacks. The very nature of Telegram 
creates a natural environment for a wide range of malign 
activities, posing challenges to the integrity of the broader 
information ecosystem.
