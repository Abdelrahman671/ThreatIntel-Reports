TA402 Uses Complex IronWind Infection Chains to Target
Middle East-Based Government Entities
⋮ 11/7/2023
November 14, 2023
Joshua Miller and the Proofpoint Threat Research Team
Key takeaways 
From July through October 2023, Proofpoint researchers observed TA402 engage in phishing
campaigns that delivered a new initial access downloader dubbed IronWind. The downloader was
followed by additional stages that consisted of downloaded shellcode.  
During the same period, TA402 adjusted its delivery methods, moving from using Dropbox links to
using XLL and RAR file attachments, likely to evade detection efforts.  
This threat actor has consistently engaged in extremely targeted activity, pursuing less than five
organizations with any single campaign. They have also maintained a strong focus on government
entities based in the Middle East and North Africa.  
Proofpoint has tracked TA402 since 2020. Our researchers assess the threat actor is a Middle
Eastern advanced persistent threat (APT) group that historically has operated in the interests of the
Palestinian Territories and overlaps with public reporting on Molerats, Gaza Cybergang,
Frankenstein, and WIRTE.  
Overview 
2/6
In mid-2023, Proofpoint researchers first identified TA402 (Molerats, Gaza Cybergang, Frankenstein,
WIRTE) activity using a labyrinthine infection chain to target Middle Eastern governments with a new
initial access downloader Proofpoint has dubbed IronWind. From July through October 2023, TA402
utilized three variations of this infection chain—Dropbox links, XLL file attachments, and RAR file
attachments—with each variant consistently leading to the download of a DLL containing the
multifunctional malware. In these campaigns, TA402 also pivoted away from its use of cloud services like
Dropbox API, which Proofpoint researchers observed in activity from 2021 and 2022, to using actor-
controlled infrastructure for C2 communication.  
As of late October 2023, Proofpoint researchers had not observed any changes in targeting by   TA402,
an APT group that historically has operated in the interests of the Palestinian Territories, nor identified
any indications of an altered mandate despite the current conflict in the region. It remains possible that
this threat actor will redirect its resources as events continue to unfold.   
Campaign details and IronWind 
July 2023 Activity: In July 2023, Proofpoint researchers observed the first of TA402’s new, more
convoluted infection chain as compared to prior campaign activity from 2021 and 2022 (Figures 1 and
2).

TA402 engaged in a phishing campaign using a compromised Ministry of Foreign Affairs email account to
target Middle Eastern government entities. The emails used an economic-themed social engineering lure
("2024-2023 برنامج التعاون اإلقتصادي مع دول مجلس التعاون الخليجي" [Machine Translation: Economic cooperation
program with the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council 2023-2024"]) to deliver a Drobox link that
downloaded a malicious Microsoft PowerPoint Add-in (PPAM) file. The PPAM file contained a macro that
dropped three files: version.dll (IronWind), timeout.exe, and gatherNetworkInfo.vbs. Timeout.exe was
used to sideload IronWind. Once sideloaded, IronWind sent an HTTP GET request to a known TA402 C2
domain, theconomics[.]net, which was hosted on 191.101.78[.]189 at the time of analysis in August 2023.
Proofpoint researchers have observed TA402 leveraging Dropbox for malware delivery since at least
December 2021. 
After receiving the HTTP GET request, the C2 responded with shellcode that represented the third stage
of the infection chain. During Proofpoint’s analysis, the shellcode used reflective .NET loaders to conduct
WMI queries. The shellcode also served as a multipurpose loader, downloading the fourth stage—a .NET
executable that used SharpSploit, a .NET post-exploitation library written in C#.  
The .NET executable continued to use HTTPS POSTs and GETs to theconomics[.]net for C2 and
received JSON responses. It passed authentication via a custom UserAgent string, "Mozilla/5.0
(Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:<tag>) Gecko/<auth> Firefox/3.15" and almost certainly would have
downloaded additional shellcode payloads. Based on Proofpoint analysis, this UserAgent is unique
enough to be used for detection purposes. Proofpoint researchers did not observe the fifth stage at the
time of analysis but took note that the last stage payload contained unused code, suggesting TA402 may
be making further updates and adjustments to the malware.  
4/6
August 2023 activity: In August 2023, TA402 shifted to sending an attached XLL file to load IronWind
using “قائمة األشخاص والكيانات (المصنفة إرهابية) من قبل هيئة مكافحة غسيل األموال وتمويل اإلرهاب” as a lure instead of using a
malicious PPAM file delivered via Drobox. The machine translation of the lure is as follows: “List of
persons and entities (designated as terrorists) by the Anti-Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing
Authority.” TA402 used the same compromised Ministry of Foreign Affairs email account observed in the
July activity. As part of the initial infection process, TA402 sent a base64 encoded check in to Request
Inspector—a third-party service for creating endpoints for HTTP requests—to exfiltrate some system
information. 
October 2023 activity: In October 2023, TA402 shifted a portion of its infection chain yet again. This
time the threat actor sent a RAR file attachment that contained a renamed version of tabcal.exe for
sideloading IronWind and propsys.dll (IronWind) instead of using a malicious PPAM file delivered via
Dropbox or an attached XLL file to load the malware. The delivered malware again used Request
Inspector for initial check in and a new TA402 C2 domain, inclusive-economy[.]com.  
TA402 also continued to leverage a compromised Ministry of Foreign Affairs email account to send
phishing emails with the lure ") بخصوص الحرب على غزة110( تقريــر وتوصيــات الـدورة,” which translates to “Report
and Recommendations of the 110th Session on the War on Gaza.” Currently, TA402 only appears to be
using the conflict for lure purposes. Additionally, TA402 continues to phish, indicating the conflict has not
significantly disrupted the group’s operations. 
IronWind: PDB analysis  
During malware analysis, Proofpoint researchers identified TA402 had failed to sanitize the group’s PDB
paths during malware development for multiple stages. A YARA rule for hunting purposes is attached at
the end of this blog.  
Based on the following PDB paths, Proofpoint researchers assess with moderate confidence that the
IronWind malware project name is \tornado\ and malware development is broken out by function,
including IA (the IronWind dropper), stager (the stager DLL), and payloads.  
VT Stage 1: C:\Users\Win\Desktop\Reno\NewTor\27-07-
2023\tornado\tornado\Payloads\BAR_33\I.A\out\IA.pdb 
July 2023 Stage 2: C:\Users\User\Desktop\tornado\Payloads\WKS_10\I.A\out\stagerx64.pdb 
August 2023 Stage 1: C:\Users\Win\Desktop\Reno\NewTor\27-07-
2023\tornado\tornado\Payloads\BAR_38\I.A\out\IA.pdb 
August 2023 Stage 2: C:\Users\Win\Desktop\Reno\NewTor\NewIA-Tornado-

Stage 4: K:\prj\WIP\C# - Payload\Client-Side\https\client-Divided\KALV\obj\Release\KALV.pdb 
Geofencing 
TA402 regularly employs geofencing techniques to make detection of its malicious activity more difficult.
This aspect of the threat actor’s tactics, techniques, and procedures has remained consistent since at
least 2020. Even with the more elaborate infection chains observed in 2023, TA402 continues to include
URLs that will at times redirect to decoy documents hosted on legitimate document hosting platforms if
the geofencing is not bypassed.   
5/6
Attribution 
Proofpoint researchers attributed the campaigns to TA402 based on tactics, techniques, and victimology.
The 2023 campaigns share similarly themed lures as historical TA402 activity and retain a focus on
Arabic-speaking targets located in the Middle East. Over the years, TA402 has consistently targeted
government entities based in the Middle East and North Africa, at times going after the same targets
repeatedly. TA402’s use of compromised Ministry of Foreign Affairs email accounts, geofencing, and
decoy documents additionally contributed to the attribution. 
Proofpoint researchers also assess TA402 operates in support of Palestinian espionage objectives with a
focus on intelligence collection. This is consistent with prior Proofpoint published reports on this threat
actor. While Proofpoint recognizes that TA402 overlaps with a number of publicly reported threat actors,
including Molerats, WIRTE, and Frankenstein, Proofpoint researchers cluster independently based on
internal malware analysis and investigations.  
Conclusion 
Based on Proofpoint’s tracking of this threat actor since 2020, TA402 remains a persistent and innovative
threat actor that routinely retools its attack methods and malware in support of its cyber espionage
mandate. Its ongoing use of geofencing and decoy documents continues to serve its detection evasion
efforts. While TA402 is an intelligence collection focused threat actor with a specific interest in Middle
Eastern and North African government entities, the group could find itself under direction to adjust its
targeting or social engineering lures in reaction to the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict.
