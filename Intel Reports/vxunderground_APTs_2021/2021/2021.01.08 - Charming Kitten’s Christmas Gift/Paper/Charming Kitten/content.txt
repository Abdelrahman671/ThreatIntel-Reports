During the Christmas holidays and the beginning of
the new year, the Charming Kitten group, the
Iranian state-backed hackers, have begun a targeted
phishing campaign of espionage against different
individuals to collect information.

Charming Kitten, also known as APT35 and
Phosphorus, is one of the hacker groups backed by
the Islamic Republic of Iran. The group started the
new round of attacks at a time when most
companies, offices, organizations, etc. were either
closed or half-closed during Christmas holidays
and, as a result, their technical support and IT
departments were not able to immediately review,
identify, and neutralize these cyber incidents.
Charming Kitten has taken full advantage of this
timing to execute its new campaign to maximum
effect.

A review of samples of this phishing campaign
shows that the attackers concentrated their attacks
on individuals’ online accounts, especially personal
emails (Gmail, Yahoo! and Outlook) and business
emails (organization and university emails). After
accessing the credential details of the accounts, they
steal sensitive data from their victims.
Additionally, based on the collected evidence, it is
clear that Charming Kitten specifically chose their
targets from members of think tanks, political
research centers, university professors, journalists,
and environmental activists in the countries around
the Persian Gulf, Europe, and the US. Our
observations show this phishing campaign is a
1/21/2021

continuation of other Charming Kitten campaigns
that were started in the third and fourth quarters of
2020.
Details Of The Attacks
Our examination of the acquired samples shows
hackers generally use two main methods of
“Sending Fake SMS” and “Sending Fake Emails” to
execute their attacks. It is also important to note
that whilst using these two methods, the attackers
try not to leave any trace of themselves and, even
1/21/2021
Charming Kitten’s Christmas Gift - Certfa Lab
https://blog.certfa.com/posts/charming-kitten-christmas-gift/
6/42
after gaining access to their victims’ accounts, they
do not block the victims’ access to their own
accounts.
Method #1: Fake SMS
Like many other phishing attacks, in this phishing
campaign, Charming Kitten uses a fake SMS (Figure
1) to trick their victims. They send confirmation
messages stating ‘Google Account Recovery’ to their
targets; they claim these messages are sent by
Google and the user must follow the link in the SMS
to confirm the identity.

Figure 1. A sample of the fake SMS
1/21/2021
Charming Kitten’s Christmas Gift - Certfa Lab
https://blog.certfa.com/posts/charming-kitten-christmas-gift/
8/42
The most important point in this method is the
structure of the link in the SMS that seems
legitimate: hxxps://www.google[.]com/url?
q=https://script.google.com/xxxx.
At first glance, these links generally cause less
suspicion for the targets. After opening the links
and several redirections, the victims are led to final
phishing domains such as “mobile[.]recover-
session-service[.]site” etc. More detail about this
technique is available in the Redirect Chain section.
Method #2: Fake Email
1/21/2021
Charming Kitten’s Christmas Gift - Certfa Lab
https://blog.certfa.com/posts/charming-kitten-christmas-gift/
9/42
Another method used in this phishing campaign is
sending fake emails with deceptive titles like “Merry
Christmas, and sending note/book/photo and
others”, which are usually sent by previously hacked
emails.
Figure 2 shows one of these phishing emails where
the attackers cordially invite the target to open the
link in the email’s body. In order to achieve this,
Charming Kitten used the subject “New Years
Greetings” with convincing sentences such as “This
year I decided to make my friends happy with my
last book. Here’s my special Xmas gift for you.” in
1/21/2021

the body of email. By comparing Figure 2 to Figure
1, it is clear that the structure of the link is similar to
the links used in the fake SMS.
Figure 2. A sample of the fake email

We believe that Charming Kitten continuously try
different styles of email to trap their victims as
quickly as possible. For example, Figure 3 shows
another fake email that was sent to the same victim
a day after the initial email (Figure 2).

Redirect Chain
Utilizing and weaponizing legal and credible
services to hide destructive intent is one of the
techniques used by hackers in some phishing
campaigns.
This technique has become significant in the recent
campaign by Charming Kitten. Our latest
investigations show that this Iranian hacking group
has focused on this method over the past two years.
1/21/2021
Charming Kitten’s Christmas Gift - Certfa Lab
https://blog.certfa.com/posts/charming-kitten-christmas-gift/
14/42
For example, Charming Kitten weaponized
“site.google.com”  in 2019 and “script.google.com”
in this campaign.
Our examination shows the hackers have used a mix
of services such as ‘script.google.com’ and
‘iplogger.org’ in this campaign in order to create a
chain of redirection to obfusticate their hacking
operations. Redirection links initially help bypass
the security layers in email services, and then
provide the attackers more control to redirect the
target to the final URL.
Figure 4 shows an experimental example of the
function of each link in the redirect chain technique.

Infinite different types of phishing
attacks
Our investigation shows Charming Kitten has
targeted different people and organisations in
relatively different fields. For example, based on our
initial findings, the hackers use domain names such
as mail-newyorker[.]com, news12[.]com[.]recover-
session-service[.]site with the intention of targeting
“The New Yorker” online magazine readers and
“News 12 Networks” TV channel staff and their
audience.

Charming Kitten had previously used the same
method using names such as Wall Street Journal ,
CNN , Deutsche Welle , etc.

Thanks for your article. It was fantastic and I
enjoyed it. Photos and contents were very
interesting. Congratulations! We actually traveled
to this area with my friends a couple of years ago
and took some good pictures at this location and
found some interesting things that I didn’t see in
your article. I think you’ll understand if you see
my pictures and contents. I’ll share it for you here.
 
In reviewing other samples, we have found that
Charming Kitten has used many fake domains to
target different online accounts in different services.
Although accounts such as Gmail, Yahoo! and

Outlook are the main targets of this campaign, there
are more samples that show this Iranian hacking
group targets other services such as Planet.com and
PlanetObserver.com - both are online satellite
imagery services for special sectors such as
governments, industries, and military defenses -
which shows the breadth of their campaign. Figures
6 to 8 are different series of phishing pages that
were developed by Charming Kitten.

Infrastructure and History
We have reviewed and matched five common
indicators to assess and analyze the infrastructure
that has been used by Charming Kitten (Figure 9).
This infrastructure has been used mostly in the
third and fourth quarters of 2020:
Reverse IP/DNS lookup and matching the
history with other common indicators
Common IP or IP CIDR range match
Use of unconventional TLD (i.e. .site) and
using WHOIS protection
Use of deceptive words such as session,
confirm, recovery, verification, service, etc., in
the name of the URLs as well as subdomains
1/21/2021
Charming Kitten’s Christmas Gift - Certfa Lab
https://blog.certfa.com/posts/charming-kitten-christmas-gift/
25/42
Parallel use of Dynamic DNS, such as
ddns.net, in a short period of time, which has
a temporal matching with other indicators
Reviewing these indicators side by side show that
Charming Kitten has been constantly active in
recent months and has executed other attacks at the
time of writing this report.
In reviewing related activity patterns of Charming
Kitten and information about the infrastructure
used by this hacking group, we believe the extent
and scale of this campaign is significant in
comparison with previous activity of Charming
Kitten.

Conclusion And Recommendations
This investigation only relates to one aspect of the
Iran-backed hacker group’s activities in recent
months; the extent and magnitude of this campaign
was unforeseeable. We can conclude that Charming
Kitten has used complex techniques to gain access
to individuals and organizations that Iranian
intelligence services are interested in targeting.

In order to protect yourself against these attacks, we
strongly recommend using secure and safe
authentication methods such as two factor
authentication with security keys, such YubiKey ,
for your online accounts.
As usual, we firmly suggest not to click on unknown
links, to carefully review any URLs before entering
credential information, and not to download and
run unknown files on mobile, personal or work
computers. These measures can significantly protect
people who are the targets of these types of
campaigns.
