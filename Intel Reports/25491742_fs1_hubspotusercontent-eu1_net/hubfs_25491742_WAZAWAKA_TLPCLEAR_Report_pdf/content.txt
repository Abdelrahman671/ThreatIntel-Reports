Introduction
Mikhail Pavlovich Matveev, also known by the monikers Wazawaka, Boriselcin,
and Orange, has recently risen to prominence within the Threat Intelligence (TI) community,
emerging as a key player in the dynamic digital threat landscape. Matveev is currently
under scrutiny for his alleged involvement in cybercriminal activities, prompting concerns
across the cyber realm.
This research provides a comprehensive analysis of Matveev’s background, affiliations, and
tactics in the threat landscape associated with his activities. It includes information about
Matveev’s team and his close relations with other threat actors. The structure of Matveev’s
team and its choice of third-party ransomware-as-a-service vendors provides in-depth
insight into the current state of the cybercriminal industry as a whole. This information is vital
for information security leaders who wish to improve their risk management models and
boost cyber resilience against sophisticated threats.
Wazawaka and his team members prominently exhibit an insatiable greed for ransom
payments, demonstrating a significant disregard for ethical values in their cyber operations.
Employing tactics that involve intimidation through threats to leak sensitive files, engaging
in dishonest practices, and persisting in retaining files even after the victim complies with the
ransom payment, they exemplify the ethical void prevalent in the practices of traditional
ransomware groups.
Intercepted communications reveal insights into threat actors’ motivations, thought
processes, and reactions. Thorough analysis of these behaviors aids in developing effective
strategies against their tactics. Instances where we’ve shared outputs of services used during
ransomware attacks, like call-centers, highlight how threat actors adeptly manipulate IT
administrators. Significantly, prioritizing personal reputation over company security makes
IT professionals susceptible to collaboration with ransomware groups. Understanding and
countering these manipulative techniques is vital for bolstering cybersecurity defenses.
Please note that this report has two versions. The ”Private Release” is provided to law
enforcement agencies, applicable CERTS / CSIRTS, and members of our U.S.T.A. Threat
Intel Platform (with appropriate annotations and reductions). Likewise, the ”Public
Release” is publicly disseminated to advance the global fight against high-end threat
actors and APTs.

Executive Summary
Under the Wazawaka moniker, Matveev leads a team of six professional pentesters and
manages relationships with other notable threat actors, who provide various means of
support, services, and expertise. The report includes a detailed analysis of Wazawaka’s
team, an overview of its changing tech stack preferences, and the affiliations that enable
these changes to take place.
Comprehensive analysis of Wazawaka’s team structure and their TTPs : Comprising six
adept penetration testers, the Wazawaka team is under the coordination and leadership
of Matveev. The team adopts a flat hierarchical structure, promoting equal participation
among its members. Each individual contributes resources and expertise as needed,
showcasing a remarkable level of flexibility in adapting to new scenarios and situations. This
report delves into the team’s structure, providing insights into their communications and
collaborative dynamics.
Presenting an example of ransomware groups’ ethical values : Internal communications of
the groups expose a troubling pattern as team members consistently resort to deception
and manipulation of victims to further the group’s interests. The group’s ethical approach is
particularly alarming as they even try to deceive paying victims. Ransomware operators
engage in seemingly genuine negotiations, only to betray agreements and boast about
deceitful tactics. This report underscores a clear message : IT leaders and staff cannot trust
ransomware operators under any circumstances. Attempts to establish rapport are strategic
maneuvers grounded in an amoral realpolitik, highlighting a zero-sum game where winning
takes precedence over ethical considerations.
Wazawaka-Evilcorp-Bogachev : Our research also uncovered a connection between Mikhail
Matveev and Evgeniy Bogachev, a threat actor linked to the well-known EvilCorp cybercrime
group. Internal communications show Matveev openly admiring Bogachev as a source of
inspiration, and technical analysis of internal technologies suggest that Wazawaka and
EvilCorp may have started collaborating after Babuk’s source code was publicly released[1].
Wazawaka-LockBit-BassterLord : Wazawaka is known to have worked as a LockBit affiliate
between 2020 and 2021[17], and remained in close contact with a prominent threat actor
in the LockBit ecosystem afterward. Our researchers identified internal communications
describing LockBit as one of the only viable Ransomware-As-a-Service platforms currently
available, showing clear disdain for the toolkits offered by competing figures like Dudka.
Wazawaka-Babuk-Monti-Dudka : Our research indicates that Wazawaka occupied a
management-level role with the Babuk Ransomware Group up until early 2022, and eventually
took a similar position at the end of that year. Internal conversations suggest a deep and
complex relationship between the Wazawaka team and another threat actor named Dudka.
This threat actor is likely responsible for developing the Babuk platform, releasing its source
code publicly shortly before it ceased activity, and developing the Monti platform later that
year.

Technical Analysis
For a more in-depth technical analysis of Wazawaka and his team’s modus operandi,
we will present interesting details of their capabilities and tactics. Additionally, we will
analyze their team structure, examining the collaborative dynamics and individual roles
that contribute to their effectiveness in navigating the complex landscape of ransomware.
3.1
Team Structure
Wazawaka’s role as the leader of a sophisticated cybercriminal team adds another layer
to his prominence in the ransomware ecosystem. Managing six skilled pentesters, namely 777,
bobr.kurwa, krbtgt, shokoladniy_zayac, WhyNot, and dushnila, Wazawaka orchestrates a
well-coordinated effort to execute ransomware attacks. What sets his team structure apart
is the principle of egalitarianism, where each member enjoys equal rights and privileges.
This flat hierarchy (as shown in Figure 2) not only fosters a sense of collaboration but also
enhances operational efficiency by promoting a collective approach to decision-making.
Figure 2. Team structure of the Wazawaka.
The team’s collaborative ethos, combined with the diverse skill sets of its members, contributes
to the group’s effectiveness in navigating the complex landscape of ransomware. Notably,
their shared financial contributions for operational needs further solidify the cooperative
nature of the team, demonstrating a commitment to mutual success and resource allocation.
Wazawaka’s leadership style emphasizes the importance of teamwork, allowing his team to
adapt swiftly to evolving cyber threats and execute targeted attacks with a high degree of
sophistication.
We analyzed thousands of communication logs to understand the threat actors, but
there may still be gaps in our findings due to the nature of our intelligence collection.

3.1.1
Wazawaka
Wazawaka, serving as the leader of the cybercriminal team under scrutiny, embodies
a pivotal role in orchestrating and guiding the group’s operations. His influence extends
across both public and private domains, where he adopts the monikers Wazawaka, boriselcin,
, and Orange in public forums and solitaire, gas,
monikers within private
environments.
Figure 3. Vinki dismisses Wazawaka’s credentials.
In a candid forum post (as shown in Figure 3), a threat actor named Vinki dismisses
Wazawaka’s credentials, claiming that he is not the mastermind behind the ransomware
attacks attributed to him. According to Vinki, Wazawaka is portrayed as an author and
creator in the media, but he alleges that none of the attacks credited to Wazawaka are
genuinely his own. Vinki characterizes Wazawaka as a self-promoter who claims attacks
orchestrated by others, specifically mentioning individuals like garrett, also known as Uncle
with Cancer or Dudka. Vinki contends that Wazawaka’s media presence is based on falsely
claimed credit for attacks and that, since 2021 or earlier, he has been offering his services
to others while operating in the shadows. The post concludes with a derisive remark,
suggesting that an alliance led by individuals like Wazawaka will not achieve positive
outcomes, comparing it to a gathering of junkies and alcoholics. This forum post presents a
critical perspective on Wazawaka’s role in the cyber underworld, challenging his claimed
achievements and highlighting alleged discrepancies in his public image.
Contrary to Vinki’s assertion that Wazawaka is merely a poser, our investigation reveals
that Wazawaka is actively involved in orchestrating and executing cyber attacks. While
we acknowledge the significant role played by Dudka within the team, specializing in
developing ransomware platforms and builders, our findings suggest that Wazawaka is
directly responsible for numerous attacks. In some instances, Dudka is also observed to be
directly involved in cyber attacks, further solidifying his integral position within the group.
However, it’s important to note that Wazawaka may not possess the technical prowess
of other threat actors like REvil or Conti. Instead, he relies on leveraging his reputation
and connections to obtain potential targets, often focusing on low-hanging fruit. This
nuanced perspective underscores the multifaceted nature of Wazawaka’s involvement
in cyber operations and challenges the notion that he is solely a PR figure.

In a revealing conversation (as shown in Figure 4) between Wazawaka and his team members
regarding his recent indictment, a surprising reaction emerged. His casual wordings and
even a touch of amusement suggest an unexpected response to the gravity of the situation.
Wazawaka seems almost pleased by the attention, finding humor in the notoriety brought
about by the FBI’s actions. Furthermore, he expresses a sense of relief in the context of
geopolitical dynamics, stating that it’s fortunate for him that Russia does not pursue his
arrest. This conversation unveils a complex blend of defiance, indifference, and a certain level
of satisfaction within Wazawaka’s response to the legal ramifications he faces at the moment.
It’s essential to note that Wazawaka denies the fact that he is the administrator of LockBit
and Hive but accepts the affiliation with Babuk. He clarifies that he was merely an affiliate
of LockBit and Hive, distancing himself from direct administrative roles. Wazawaka appears
to believe that the FBI is overreacting to his affiliations, implying a sense of detachment and
downplaying the severity of the charges against him. This nuanced stance adds another
layer to his response, reflecting a strategic approach to navigating the legal complexities
surrounding his cyber activities.

In a conversation (as shown in Figure 5) with his team members, Wazawaka shared intriguing
details from a recent discussion with an information security professional at Gazprom, a
major Russian energy company. Notably, it was revealed that the Gazprom professional is
the boyfriend of Wazawaka’s fiancée’s sister. This connection adds a personal dimension to
the conversation, suggesting that the interaction occurred before Wazawaka’s wedding.
In a surprising twist, Wazawaka mentioned that the individual from Gazprom did not
recognize him during their conversation. Despite this personal link, Wazawaka maintained
his distinctive viewpoint, characterizing information security experts and white hat hackers
as narrow-minded, while passionately defending his view that the most skilled hackers are
those who operate as black hat hackers.

777
Within Wazawaka’s team, 777 holds a pivotal role, emerging as a key figure following
Wazawaka himself. Demonstrating a strong rapport with Dudka and other threat actors
like RagnarLocker, 777 plays a crucial part in maintaining collaborative relationships within
the team. Without a doubt, Wazawaka places considerable trust in 777, often considering
and implementing his suggestions. In a revealing conversation captured in Figure 6,
Wazawaka and 777 discuss Dudka, with 777 proposing a strategic move to assume full
control over Dudka’s platforms, specifically highlighting Monti ransomware. The proposal
involves redirecting a larger share of victim payments, suggesting a shift from the standard
10% to 15%, allowing Dudka to receive a higher percentage without actively contributing to
the team’s efforts. This insight sheds light on the dynamics and decision-making processes
within the team, showcasing 777’s influential role.

bobr.kurwa
In another piece of communication (as shown in Figure 7) within Wazawaka’s team
members, bobr.kurwa, a seemingly ordinary pentester within the group, unintentionally
disclosed intriguing financial details. In a casual conversation, bobr.kurwa shared that he
is financially struggling. According to the conversations, bobr.kurwa currently possesses
115,000 Rubles ($1360) in his physical vault, along with 38,000 Rubles ($450) in his current
bank account and an additional 16,000 Rubles ($190) in his credit card. However, these
disclosed amounts indicate a relatively modest financial outcome, considering all the risks
and legal implications of their activities. This observation highlights the challenging and often
unrewarding nature of their illicit operations, emphasizing that the financial gains achieved
by some of the team members may not be profitable.
Figure 7. Message from bobr.kurwa.
This financial disclosure by bobr.kurwa sheds light on the broader financial dynamics within
Wazawaka’s team, offering a nuanced perspective on their overall success or, perhaps, failure.
Despite successfully infiltrating numerous enterprises, the team faces challenges in carrying
out substantial financial gains through ransom payments from their victims. This predicament
raises questions about the team’s efficacy in conducting successful ransom negotiations.
Potential factors contributing to this financial shortfall could include excessive ransom
demands or inaccurate assessments of the victim’s value, illustrating the complex challenges
and potential setbacks faced by cybercriminals within the team. The paradoxical scenario
of successful infiltrations intertwined with financial struggles highlights the complexity and
uncertainties in the cybercrime business orchestrated by Wazawaka and his team.

his team member WhyNot, the topic of a new addition to the team arose as they discussed
the imminent arrival of Shocker (a.k.a krbtgt), a seasoned pentester. Shocker’s collaboration
with Dudka and his previous role as the moderator of XSS.is (DamageLab) were highlighted,
showcasing his extensive experience in the cybercrime field. However, in an internal discussion,
Wazawaka’s team member, WhyNot, injected humor into the conversation, jokingly remarking
that the team doesn’t necessarily need more people but rather more victims to focus their
efforts on. This jesting comment added a playful tone to the conversation, revealing the
dynamics of the group and the expectations of team members.

shokoladniy_zayac
The threat actor using the nickname shokoladniy_zayac is likely associated with Bakhmut,
Ukraine, based on available information. While it’s not confirmed with total certainty, our
research points to a probable connection. Interestingly, within the cybercriminal team,
other members have created a chat group (as shown in Figure 9) to mock and joke about
shokoladniy_zayac. Adding a poignant layer to this situation is the context that Bakhmut
has faced significant destruction during the Russia-Ukraine war. In a somewhat dark and
ironic twist, team members humorously tease shokoladniy_zayac about finally escaping the
tumultuous events in Bakhmut.

Relations
Wazawaka boasts connections to various threat actors, establishing a network that
includes notable individuals like Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev, Dudka, BassterLord, Kajit,
etc. Renowned for his expertise in the realm of cybercrime, Wazawaka holds a reputable
position within the ransomware community. His influence extends beyond technical prowess,
as he actively engages in public relations efforts, showcasing a penchant for self-promotion.
This emphasis on PR highlights Wazawaka’s strategic approach, not only in executing
cyberattacks but also in shaping his public image within the broader context of the evolving
and interconnected landscape of cyber threats. The relationships he maintains, along with
his visibility within the ransomware community, underscore his significance in the intricate
web of cybercriminal activities.

indictment in the Russian media and describes instances of public recognition, where people
on the streets approach him to offer congratulations and shake his hand. However, there’s
a palpable sense of constraint as Wazawaka acknowledges his inability to leave Russia.
Seeking advice, he turns to the seasoned cybercriminal Bogachev, who reassures him with a
nonchalant perspective, citing his own years of experience living under legal scrutiny. This
conversation paints a complex picture of Wazawaka’s mixed emotions, balancing national
pride, public acknowledgement, and the sobering reality of legal constraints.

The potential connection between Wazawaka and EvilCorp becomes increasingly important
as various factors align. Following the U.S. government’s sanctions against Evil Corp in 2019
[22], the ransomware group underwent a transformation by renaming its operations to
evade scrutiny and continue its illicit activities. Notably, in May 2021, the Babuk data leak
site underwent a design refresh, introducing a new identity for the group named ’payload
bin.’ [2] Threat intelligence (TI) researchers quickly linked this rebranded entity to Evil Corp.
This technical association, coupled with the known relationship between Wazawaka and
the notorious cybercriminal Bogachev, suggests deeper connections among Wazawaka,
Bogachev, and the operations of Evil Corp. It’s crucial to note that while these indicators
point to a potential association, further analysis is required to solidify this hypothesis and
unveil the extent of the relationships.

Dudka
Dudka, also known as garrett, emerges as a pivotal figure in the ransomware landscape,
maintaining close connections with Wazawaka and a team member identified as 777. Based
on our information, Dudka serves as the developer behind the Babuk and Monti ransomware,
showcasing his proficiency in creating both locker and TOR-hosted management panels.
Despite his prowess in development, Dudka exhibits comparatively limited experience in
infiltrating victim systems. Nevertheless, he stands out as a reputable and well-connected
individual within the cybersecurity realm.

Dudka played a crucial role as the primary developer of Babuk ransomware, even releasing
its source code in forums, most likely due to his thoughts on karma and spiritual beliefs. In a
revealing conversation depicted in Figure 17 between Wazawaka and 777, Wazawaka openly
assumed full responsibility for Dudka, acknowledging his indictment for the distribution of
Babuk. Interestingly, Wazawaka shared insights from a conversation with Bassterlord, who
cautioned about the Threat Intelligence (TI) community and law enforcement possessing
information about Dudka, posing a potential risk of de-anonymization. In response,
Wazawaka advised Dudka against leaving Russia, underscoring the intricate consequences
and risks that extend beyond the digital realm within the threat actor community.
In a separate conversation documented in Figure 18, Wazawaka brought attention to
Dudka’s mental health challenges. Both Wazawaka and his team member, 777, openly
acknowledged the role Dudka played in the failure of Babuk ransomware.
Dudka exhibits an intriguing persona not only in the cyber realm but also in his real life.
Unconventionally, he consults a fortune teller (as can be seen from Figure 19) to predict the
optimal ransom demand when targeting victims. Dudka’s belief in mystic events and the
concept of karma adds a unique dimension to his approach. This unconventional blend of
cyber activities and spiritual elements showcases the diversity of perspectives within the
threat actor landscape, emphasizing the varied motivations and beliefs that can influence
their actions beyond the digital realm and rational actions.
Contrastingly, Dudka remains a proficient developer within the cybercrime landscape. In a
conversation detailed in Figure 20, Wazawaka and his team member discuss a new botnet
crafted by Dudka. Wazawaka expressed expectations of a compact loader rather than a
fully functional Remote Access Trojan (RAT) from this new creation. Acknowledging Dudka’s
mental stability concerns and spiritual beliefs, Wazawaka suggested motivating Dudka
during positive moods, revealing a nuanced approach within the team to leverage Dudka’s
capabilities effectively.

Bassterlord emerges as a significant figure in the cybercriminal landscape, heading
the National Hazard Agency—a team associated with ransomware activities[8]. Notably,
Bassterlord has authored two training manuals, showcasing his expertise in the cybercrime
world. One of these manuals, distributed freely on Russian hacking forums, reflects his
willingness to share knowledge within the hacking community. In a testament to the lucrative
nature of his insights, Bassterlord also created a premium manual, sold for $10,000 per
copy[15] . Beyond providing instructional materials, Bassterlord actively engages in direct
training, imparting the skills necessary for conducting ransomware attacks to other hackers.
Operating as an ”access broker,” he extends his influence by selling unauthorized access to
compromised victim environments, further solidifying his role as a multifaceted player in the
cyber underworld.
Figure 22. Conversation about the Bassterlord’s retirement.
In March 2023, BassterLord announced his retirement following the release of insights from

Bassterlord’s operational security (OPSEC). There is a common belief among them that threat
intelligence researchers possess access to all of Bassterlord’s devices and communication
channels. In a conversation depicted in Figure 25, Wazawaka humorously commented on
this situation, suggesting to his team members that if they want to leak a document or
information, they should send it to Bassterlord since, according to Wazawaka, anything
shared with Bassterlord is essentially becoming public knowledge. This insight provides a
glimpse into the skepticism surrounding Bassterlord’s security measures within the ecosystem.

perspective that there is no effective Ransomware-As-a-Service platform comparable to
LockBit. This shared belief reinforces their commitment to the LockBit network, seeing it
as a superior and more reliable option in the ransomware ecosystem. The convergence of
their opinions on the inadequacy of other ransomware platforms adds another layer to the
strategic considerations within their team.

NoEscape
Since its introduction in May 2023, NoEscape ransomware has operated as a potent
Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS)[5], gaining popularity as a favoured tool among
cybercriminals. Our intelligence indicates that Wazawaka has utilised this ransomware
variant since June 2023 to orchestrate targeted attacks on 5-10 victims. Throughout these
attacks, threat actors exfiltrate victims’ files to a controlled environment, providing access to
NoEscape administrators. Subsequently, these compromised files find their way to a Data
Leak Server hosted on TOR, exploiting the dark web for further illicit activities. What sets
NoEscape apart is its comprehensive suite of services, which includes a unique feature—
a built-in victim-calling service designed for intimidating and pressuring victims directly.
Adding to the complexity, NoEscape is operated by individuals predominantly speaking
Russian, suggesting potential regional or cultural affiliations. Figure 39 shows the conversation
between NoEscape support and Wazawaka’s team members on the victim who refused to
pay the ransom.

Ragnar Locker
Ragnar Locker, emerging in December 2019, gained notoriety for a series of
attacks targeting critical infrastructure entities worldwide[20]. Diverging from the typical
Ransomware-as-a-Service model, Ragnar Locker operated as semi-private. Unlike actively
recruiting external affiliates, the operation collaborated with external pentesters to breach
networks. This distinctive approach set Ragnar Locker apart from its counterparts. However,
a significant setback occurred as the Tor negotiation and data leak sites of Ragnar Locker
were seized on October 19, 2023, in a coordinated international law enforcement operation[6].
Figure 40. Conversation about the Ragnar Locker between Wazawaka and 777.
In a noteworthy exchange (as shown in Figure 40) between Wazawaka and 777, it became
apparent that Shocker, also known as krbtgt, maintains a connection with Ragnar Locker.
Clearly, Ragnar functions as a facilitator, providing access to potential victims while
anticipating subsequent ransomware attacks utilizing their strain. In this arrangement,
Ragnar claims a 30% share of all ransom payments resulting from these attacks. Upon
Wazawaka’s approval,
from Ragnar took on the role of a liaison for Wazawaka’s
team. Operating in this capacity,

establishing a collaborative dynamic between Ragnar Locker and Wazawaka’s team in
executing ransomware operations.

Hive
Hive functioned as a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) platform from June 2021[24] to
January 2023. In January 2023, a joint investigation led by U.S. and German authorities,
involving 13 law enforcement agencies, successfully dismantled the Hive ransomware
group[13]. During an interview, Wazawaka openly admitted to being an affiliate of Hive[21].
Law enforcement agencies, as per Wazawaka’s indictment, asserted his involvement in the
distribution of Hive ransomware[12]. However, our investigation failed to identify any direct
participation of Wazawaka and his team in the ransomware attacks conducted by Hive. In
a specific internal conversation depicted in Figure 14, Wazawaka suggested discontinuing
the use of Hive to Dudka. Consequently, we consider Dudka as the conduit connecting
Wazawaka’s team to Hive ransomware.

Trigona
Trigona, a ransomware variant coded in the Delphi programming language, has been
actively operational since at least October 2022[23]. A crucial turning point in Trigona’s
development occurred in June 2023 with the introduction of its Ransomware-as-a-Service
(RaaS) program, as depicted in Figure 42. Despite these advancements, Trigona has not
emerged as a prominent player in the ransomware landscape, evident from the relatively
low number of announced victims on their public leak server.
Figure 42. Trigona Ransomware underground forum post.
Following Trigona’s announcement of its affiliate program, it seems that Wazawaka promptly
joined as an affiliate. Subsequently, Wazawaka and his team launched attacks on multiple
companies using Trigona. In a conversation observed during the investigation, as depicted in
Figure 43, Wazawaka referenced their recent victim, specifically an educational entity. Within
the discussion, Wazawaka belittled Trigona’s affiliates by using the term ”cobists,” indicating
individuals who solely rely on Cobalt Strike without possessing advanced knowledge.
Wazawaka expressed dissatisfaction with their capabilities, particularly highlighting issues
related to maintaining access from the victim’s infrastructure. To address the challenge,
Wazawaka proposed utilizing a Pass-the-Hash (PTH) attack with Mimikatz to secure a
persistent foothold, showcasing his technical expertise compared to those he regarded as
less knowledgeable. Interestingly, he also drew a parallel with inexperienced individuals in
Conti, who, despite their shortcomings, managed to amass 5-6 million in cash, underlining
the potential financial gains that could be achieved with a more proficient approach.

Smoke and Mirrors : Understanding The Workings of Wazawaka
Upon deploying the Trigona ransomware on the victims, Wazawaka and his team members
sought access to the email addresses specified in the ransom notes left on the compromised
devices. Additionally, they expressed a keen interest in utilizing other services offered by
Trigona, including their call center. In the course of our investigation, we intercepted a call
center output where attempts were made to coerce the victim into paying the ransom. This
report (as can be seen in the following page) from the call center can offer valuable insights
into the operational dynamics of ransomware teams, providing an advantage to teams
actively addressing a ransomware attack. We can outline their approach in four clear steps :
1. Sending emails : To initiate the communication process, call center actors begin by
sending emails to employees within the corporation. Before dispatching these emails,
they conduct thorough validation checks to ensure accuracy. Additionally, they take
precautions to prevent spam designations and carefully examine auto-replies to glean
further insights about the organizations. For example, if an auto-reply indicates, ”the
school will be closed until June 5th due to the cyber attack,” they extract relevant
information from such responses and relay it to the actors for additional confirmation.
2. Calling Public Numbers : Following the dispatch of emails, the actors promptly
initiate calls to the targeted organizations using publicly available information. In a
specific case, they dialed the company’s reception and discerned that the telephone
system was malfunctioning. Drawing on their experience with previous victims, they
identified the issue when the company failed to offer a standard greeting or a menu
to navigate options. When successful in establishing contact during these calls, the
actors consistently requested a transfer of the call to the IT personnel.
3. Calling IT People : A crucial aspect of the calling process is reaching out to IT personnel,
as threat actors believe that IT professionals may be more amenable to cooperation.
In a particular case, the threat actors successfully contacted the IT team without
issuing threats. Instead, they extended an offer to convey specific information to
the management. Their strategy typically involves making offers without explicit
cooperation, foreseeing that this approach would prolong the resolution process
and escalate costs significantly. Recognizing that IT personnel bear the brunt of
stress during ransomware attacks, the threat actors strategically approach them,
understanding the potential impact of their outreach.
4. Co-operation/Insider : Following their contact with IT personnel and the delivery
of their message, one of the primary objectives in these conversations is to secure
cooperation with the IT team. This can be categorized as an insider case, as certain IT
individuals swiftly align themselves with the ransomware team. In a specific instance, the
IT administrator of a UK-based educational institution explicitly requested the threat
actors not to assign blame to them. Subsequently, an agreement was reached between
the IT administrator and the threat actors, affirming that the IT department was not
responsible for the attack. The threat actors provided a guarantee to safeguard the
identity of the IT administrator in this arrangement.

An Example of a Call-center Output
- Preliminarily, before the calls, I sent an email to the employees of
the corporation. Before sending, all emails were checked for validity. No automatic email
delivery failure reports and spam protection notifications were received back, meaning that
99% of the recipients will receive the emails in the inbox, not in spam. Auto-replies were
received from the emails :
1)
the email text : ”the school will be closed until June 5th”. It
may be due to our attack;
2)
, Finance Manager (
) important in the email text : ”I
will not be in the office until June 5th, and I will not have access to email. I will get back to
you as soon as possible”.
Receiving such auto-replies guarantees that my email will reach all recipients in the inbox,
not in spam. I dialed reception at
, but it didn’t work, there were no rings,
immediately ”rings-busy” and then the call was dropped. Usually, such schools always have
a voicemail greeting the caller and offering various menus, etc. But there is no such thing
here, meaning the telephone system of the school is not working due to the attack. I dialed
the only valid mobile phone found in the corporation
, IT Network and
Systems Manager (
), his emails are in the list of email recipients I sent to the
corporation today. He answered the call.
Me : introduced myself, explained that I’m calling not to threaten but to convey information
to the management, and as an IT specialist, he should help his corporation resolve this
situation because without us, it will be very expensive and time-consuming to resolve.
Him : okay, I’m listening to you.
Me : we attacked you, we have decrypter and data, we need you to convey the email text
and our intentions to the management, for example, to Headteacher (

Him : I saw her in the recipients, she probably also received the email.
Me : yes, but there she has her corporate email, to which she probably won’t have access
until June 5th.
Him : yes, okay, I understand, I will convey the information to her.
Me : okay, do you have any questions?
Him : yes, how did you do it?

Him : you understand that our department overlooked this and we can be mildly reprimanded
for this.
Me : yes, of course, and you want us not to mention you or even say that the IT department

Him : you read my mind, if possible, but only without the universe, the United Kingdom and
the European Union will be enough. And I promise to convey the information as needed.
Me : agreed, I promise that we will cover you.
Until I started negotiating with him about insider trading, it’s not worth pressing so
immediately, maybe he won’t be useful. But the fact that he asked for help already gives us
an advantage, and he is on our hook. There is no one else to call, I think this guy will convey
all the information to the management, so that’s enough : the email reached the inboxes,
and the conversation with the IT specialist took place with a plus on our side. Waiting for
the corporation in the chat.
While it’s not our aim to get into further details related to this incident, we want to point out
that it stands out as a prime example of the danger insider threats possess. The fear of
repercussions due to a neglected aspect of his job prompted the IT Manager in question
to strike a deal with the threat actor. Although behavior like this might not result in full
cooperation or information trading with cybercriminals in all cases, it’s noteworthy to take
this risk into account. We highly advise companies, both public and private, to train their
staff on how to act in such case scenarios, fostering a culture of transparency, honesty
and trust. Failing to do so can lead to consequences of great magnitude, both from a
reputational and financial stance.
Wazawaka and his team have employed the Trigona ransomware in their recent attacks,
and their satisfaction with its performance is evident. The services they offer to their affiliates
are notably effective, contributing to their contentment. Interestingly, this level of satisfaction
may not be readily apparent on the TOR website, possibly indicating a limited number of
affiliates. It is our assessment that the relative obscurity of their activities is a consequence of
having fewer affiliates. Looking ahead, Trigona could potentially emerge as a secure haven
for ransomware affiliates, making it imperative to closely monitor their activities in the future.

Conti
Conti, a formidable ransomware hacker group, left a lasting impact on the digital
landscape from 2020 to 2022[16]. Swiftly gaining a reputation as the successor to the
notorious Ryuk ransomware, Conti operated as a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS),
providing a platform for other cybercriminals to deploy its ransomware strain and engage in
illicit activities. Behind the scenes, Wizard Spider[19], the orchestrator of both Conti and Ryuk,
showcased a high level of sophistication in their cyber operations. The group’s significance
went beyond its criminal exploits, leading the United States government to offer a reward of
up to $10 million for information on the group in May 2022[11]. Notably, Conti drew attention
during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine by declaring support for Russia and issuing
threats of ”retaliatory measures.” In response, an anonymous actor leaked over 60,000
internal chat messages, unveiling the group’s activities from the start of 2020 to February 27,
2022[4]. Despite its alarming presence, Conti surprisingly ceased its operations around May
2022, leaving the cybersecurity landscape with lingering questions and uncertainties.
Wazawaka and his team actively participated as affiliates of the Conti ransomware group,
engaging in numerous cyber attacks. Notably, Wazawaka admitted in a conversation (as
can be seen from Figure 54) to being responsible for orchestrating a Conti attack on Costa
Rica[10]. This revelation showcases the direct and impactful role played by Wazawaka’s
team in executing high-profile cyber operations orchestrated by the Conti group.
Figure 44. Conversation about Ragnar Locker.
In a team conversation (as shown in Figure 44) led by Wazawaka, bobr.kurwa expressed
hope for Ragnar Locker to become the next Conti, reflecting a shared desire within the
group. Frustration was voiced about the limitations of current ransomware options, with
the collective wish for a strain as successful as Conti. This sentiment is widespread among
various threat actor circles. However, a significant setback occurred as the Tor negotiation
and data leak sites of Ragnar Locker were seized on October 19, 2023, in a coordinated
international law enforcement operation. This turn of events dashed hopes for Ragnar to
reach Conti’s level, emphasizing the volatile nature of the cybercriminal landscape.

TTPs
In this section, we delve into the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) employed by
Wazawaka and his team. By closely examining the specific methodologies and strategies
used by this threat actor and the associated team members, we aim to provide detailed
insights into their operational patterns. It’s important to note that due to the lack of visibility
into the actions performed on the victim infrastructure, there might be some information gaps.
Understanding these TTPs is crucial for cybersecurity professionals and organizations seeking
to enhance their threat intelligence, bolster defenses, and stay abreast of the evolving
adversarial landscape.
3.4.1
Resource Development
Within the domain of Resource Development, Wazawaka and his team primarily lean on
external parties and services. Their internal capacity to generate new resources is rather
limited, leading them to heavily rely on external sources. An illustrative example is their regular
reception of a substantial access list from access brokers. To vet and validate these lists,
the team employs a tool acquired from an individual who sells such utilities in underground

access to the victim’s infrastructure, anticipating the deployment of Ragnar ransomware.
This arrangement allows
to profit from the ransom payments made by the victim.
Additionally, Wazawaka managed to acquire a collection of credentials associated with
Fortinet VPNs on a global scale. Our assessment suggests that these credentials were
obtained through an exploitation campaign dating back to June 2023. Wazawaka’s network

Command and Control
Wazawaka and his team predominantly rely on Remote Monitoring and Management
(RMM) tools such as AnyDesk or MeshCentral for victim management. Distinctively,
MeshCentral stands out as the team’s unique toolkit, frequently utilized as their preferred
open-source software for various operations.

Remote Access Software
Threat actors leverage legitimate remote access tools,
such as AnyDesk and MeshCentral, to establish an
interactive command and control channel.
As shown in Figure 49, Wazawaka and his team revolve around the use of the Open Source
remote management software, MeshCentral. For each campaign, such as those targeting
Fortinet VPNs, exploited Mobile Iron devices, or Papercut devices, they establish a new device
group. Intriguingly, they’ve also set up a separate device group named ”dadka” for Dudka.
This approach showcases their collaborative operational methodology when executing
attacks against their victims.

We scrutinized a multitude of toolkits employed by the team in their attacks and sifted through
thousands of communication logs. Yet, during the period from April 2023 to December 2023,
we could not uncover any command and control tools beyond AnyDesk and MeshCentral in
their repertoire.

Exploitation for Privilege Escalation
The threat actors exploited CVE-2023-27532 to gain
access to the victim’s backup storage.
Nevertheless, we noticed that the threat actors resorted to exploiting CVE-2023-27532 to
compromise Veeam Backup storage servers, particularly after facing challenges in elevating
their privileges. Even without acquiring domain admin privileges, their ability to exploit this
vulnerability allowed them to potentially exfiltrate data from the victim’s environment.

Toolkit
Wazawaka and his team have meticulously crafted a compact yet potent toolkit tailored
for their illicit endeavors. Within their arsenal, Mimikatz and NoPAC take center stage as
preferred tools for privilege escalation, enabling them to elevate their access privileges.
ADFinder is skillfully deployed for Active Directory discovery, enhancing their understanding
of the victim’s domain structure. The SoftPerfect Network Scanner proves indispensable for
revealing the victim’s internal network and conducting efficient port-scanning operations. In
the realm of data exfiltration, the team employs WinSCP and MEGA Client, showcasing a
versatile approach to extracting sensitive files from the victim’s infrastructure. Furthermore,
MeshCentral and AnyDesk seamlessly integrate into their toolkit, furnishing remote access
and control capabilities that facilitate the streamlined execution of their malicious objectives.

Vulnerabilities
Wazawaka and his team employed various publicly available exploits (as shown in the
below table) to infiltrate victim systems. While they predominantly relied on these existing
exploits, occasional minor code updates were made. Interestingly, the group is slower at
utilizing and adapting exploits than many other ransomware groups. For example, actors
affiliated with the former REvil group often exploit vulnerabilities within one or two days of
their public disclosure. This discrepancy serves as a notable indicator of the contrasting
capabilities between Wazawaka’s team and other, more agile ransomware groups.

Observations
Within the following Observations section, we intricately explore various facets of
Wazawaka and his team’s activities and maneuvers, offering valuable insights into their
ethical principles, Operational Security (OPSEC) methodologies, and discernible patterns
in their victim selection process. Through a comprehensive examination of these pivotal
dimensions, our objective is to illuminate the fundamental principles shaping their conduct.
4.1
Ethical Values
In a disturbing conversation, Wazawaka’s team member proposes an alarming strategy
to coerce a hospital into paying a ransom, highlighting the ethical quandaries inherent
in ransomware activities. The team member advocates for a calculated approach,
recommending the announcement of an impending release of leaked data, with HIV
information specifically singled out as a potent leverage point, having previously garnered
attention in the news. However, ethical concerns take a back seat as the team member
suggests a phased disclosure, beginning with the exposure of internal meeting protocols
and progressing to more sensitive medical data, including test results of pregnant women
and information about newborns. This morally questionable strategy underscores the serious
ethical problems associated with ransomware actors, as they not only exploit vulnerabilities
in systems but also jeopardize patient privacy and well-being for the sake of financial
gain. The proposal reveals the distressing lengths to which ransomware actors are willing to
go, simultaneously showcasing the urgent need for ethical considerations in the realm of
cybersecurity.

Smoke and Mirrors : Understanding The Workings of Wazawaka
The data exfiltrated from the hospital, as seen in Figure 52 when outlined by Wazawaka’s team
member, present a distressing array of sensitive and confidential information, raising serious
ethical concerns regarding potential implications. The data encompasses a wide range of
personal and medical details, including an extensive spreadsheet labelled ”Dati Personale
Area Marsica 1.xls,” which contains the personal data of employees. The presence of a folder
specifically marked ”Dati Sensibili HIV” underscores the severity of the breach, emphasizing
the potential for exploiting confidential HIV-related information as a last-resort leverage
tactic. Other folders delve into highly private medical records, such as ”OstetriciaAQ” detailing
gynaecological and obstetric data, and ”NeonatologiaAQ,” which includes information on
newborns, including an experimental screening program. The disclosure of information in the
folder ”dimissioni per EG” raises ethical red flags, particularly concerning premature babies
and instances of mortality. Additional folders, like ”EmatologiaAQ,” expose sensitive data
on cancer patients, and ”FisiopathologiaAppDigAQ” contains gastroenterology records.
The revelation of administrative data, court decisions, and protocol documents in folders
like ”ControlloGestine” and ”Protocolloserv” adds another layer of complexity, potentially
implicating the hospital in legal and administrative challenges. The wide-ranging nature
of this sensitive data breach underscores the profound ethical and legal implications of
potentially dire harm to individuals’ privacy and well-being.

In a broader context, ransomware teams like Wazawaka have repeatedly shown themselves
to be untrustworthy when interacting with victims. The conversation (as shown in Figure
53) between Wazawaka and the team member highlights the intricate web of deceit
woven by these malicious actors. It serves as a stark reminder that companies engaging
with ransomware groups should approach such interactions with extreme scepticism.
The recommendation is clear and loud : do not trust their assurances. These groups, as
demonstrated in the discussion, are strongly driven by financial motives, caring little for the
businesses they target. Their willingness to deceive, as seen in the suggestion to mislead
about their origin, highlights the unscrupulous nature of their tactics. Companies must
recognize that fulfilling ransom demands does not guarantee the safety of their files, and
the inherent risk extends beyond a mere financial transaction. Ransomware groups may not
delete files, and the potential for further attacks, including the sale of compromised data or
the introduction of backdoors, looms large.

4.2
OPSEC Practices
Wazawaka and his team members exhibit a curious mix of operational security (OPSEC)
practices in their cyber activities. On one hand, they employ VPNs to conceal their IP
addresses, and their private chat environments are hosted within the TOR network, enhancing
their digital anonymity. However, the effectiveness of these measures is compromised
by their willingness to divulge real-life details. In a conversation detailing Wazawaka’s
Costa Rica attack using Conti ransomware, he casually disclosed his physical location,
stating he is in Saint Petersburg. This breach of operational security by revealing specific
geographic information contradicts the typical secrecy associated with illicit cyber
operations. Additionally, the team members seem surprisingly open about their real identities,
freely discussing personal events such as weddings, construction projects, and various
locations. This contradictory combination of privacy measures and a seemingly indifferent
approach to revealing their personal details raises questions about the consistency and
efficiency of their overall OPSEC practices.

The paradoxical nature of Wazawaka and his team’s operational security practices becomes
more evident when considering their tendency to share intricate details about their real lives.
For instance, in a conversation shown in Figure 55, Wazawaka openly mentioned a meeting
concerning his upcoming wedding, showcasing a surprising level of transparency. This
willingness to disclose personal life events directly contradicts the conventional expectations
of clandestinity within the cyber underworld.
Figure 55. Conversation about wedding.
In another revealing exchange, Wazawaka disclosed his former residence in Nemchinovka,
Russia. This particular geographic detail adds another intricate dimension to their neglected
and insufficient operational security measures.

In another noteworthy instance highlighting Wazawaka’s operational security (OPSEC)
practices, a lapse in caution becomes evident when actively handling a ransomware victim.
Figure 57 captures a screenshot taken by Wazawaka during this operation. In the image,
Wazawaka is seen connecting to his operational environment hosted in a bullet-proof hosting
company, utilizing his MacBook. However, an oversight occurred as the Apple ID usage was
inadvertently left uncensored when sharing the screenshot with team members. This oversight
sheds light on the importance of meticulous attention to detail in maintaining operational
security during criminal activities.

Victim Selection
In the course of our investigation, it became apparent that Wazawaka and his team
adopted an opportunistic approach in selecting their targets. The modus operandi involves
identifying companies capable of meeting ransom demands, prompting them to proceed
with deploying ransomware. Despite our knowledge of Wazawaka’s associations with
government-affiliated individuals, we did not observe any instances of victims being
specifically designated by external parties. Remarkably, if Wazawaka were to entertain
the idea of carrying out targeted attacks against specific organizations in the future, our
assessment points to potential limitations in his capabilities for such endeavors. Consequently,
the team consistently opts to pursue easily accessible opportunities, emphasizing the readily
exploitable low-hanging fruits, and continually hones their strategies to optimize profits.

Conclusion
This report uncovers important operational information related to Wazawaka and the
relationships between different threat actors in the Ransomware-As-a-Service realm. It also
provides much-needed visibility into the capabilities of partnered threat actor affiliates and
the pressure that information security personnel face when confronted with active attacks.
This leads us to a few core insights that are critical to address for understanding the current
threat landscape and its implications :
• Threat actor groups like Wazawaka and his team can operate in a tight-knit, flat
hierarchy with operational flexibility. Individual members may develop a high level of
trust in one another, exposing the group to operational security vulnerabilities when
sharing sensitive personal information among the members.
• Significant distrust exists at the intergroup level. Group leaders may not appreciate
unpredictable threat actor behavior (like Dudka releasing Babuk’s source code
publicly), or entrust operations to platforms they feel are unstable or inefficient (like
Ragnar Locker).
• Threat actors will exploit opportunities to turn victims’ IT staff into willing accomplices.
IT leaders must consider the threat posed by malicious insiders, who may be motivated
to avoid taking blame for successful attacks.
• Threat actors show little regard for the ethics of their business model. They will deceive
and manipulate victims whenever it suits their interests. Victims have no reason to
believe even the simplest assurances from threat actors.
• Additionally, threat actors target companies from various verticals that range in sizes
and profits, showcasing no mercy for institutions operating in critical infrastructures.
This reality heavily underlines companies’ need for robust cybersecurity solutions,
ensuring that they won’t be left in a situation allowing exploitation or detrimental
compromise.
All of this information points to an increasingly amoral and unreliable business landscape
for cybercrime groups. Internal group dynamics may remain strong, but the lack of trust
between groups and the opportunistic exploitation of victims point to broadly deteriorating
conditions for most individual cybercriminals.
Cybersecurity leaders and law enforcement professionals may find opportunities to use
the dynamics demonstrated in this report to their benefit. For example, victims may use
up-to-date threat intelligence data to demonstrate in-depth knowledge of threat actor
partnerships, reducing their trust in one another and potentially disrupting fragile intergroup
dynamics. A well-informed negotiator equipped with this knowledge could quickly turn the
tables on an overconfident threat actor.
