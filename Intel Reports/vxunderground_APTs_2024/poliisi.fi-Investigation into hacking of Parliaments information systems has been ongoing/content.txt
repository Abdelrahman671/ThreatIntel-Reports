Investigation into hacking of Parliament's information
systems has been ongoing
On 18 March 2021, the National Bureau of Investigation published a press release on a criminal
investigation into the hacking of Parliament's information systems in 2020–2021. The suspected offences
under investigation have been aggravated espionage, aggravated unlawful access to an information
system, and aggravated violation of the secrecy of communications.
The police recorded a report of the incident in 2020. It is suspected that the offences were committed
between autumn 2020 and early 2021. The police have previously informed that they investigate the
hacking group APT31's connections with the incident. These connections have now been confirmed by
the investigation, and the police have also identified one suspect.
– The criminal investigation has been demanding and time-consuming because it has involved
challenging investigations into a complex criminal infrastructure, says Head of Investigation, Detective
Chief Inspector Aku Limnéll of the National Bureau of Investigation.
The criminal investigation has involved demanding investigations and analyses, and international
exchange of information. The National Bureau of Investigation has worked in close cooperation with
international actors and the Finnish Security and Intelligence Service.
The criminal investigation is ongoing.
