Foreword
T
he control room of a process plant is by turns either a boring or terrifying place, 
much like the cockpit of a ﬁ ghter jet or a large passenger aircraft: “hours of bore-
dom punctuated by moments of sheer terror,” as the old aphorism goes. The 
boredom comes from processes running properly. The terror comes when they do not. 
And, as the litany of process plant disasters shows, after the terror sometimes comes pick-
ing through the ruins, looking for bodies.
What we’ve learned in a generation of studying those horrifying days after plant 
disasters is that more often than not, the ﬁ nal straw has been the plant operators con-
sistently making wrong decisions based on the information they think they have about 
what is going on in the process. Many of these disasters have been blamed on cascades 
of alarms that made it impossible for operators to ﬁ gure out which alarms actually were 
important and what they meant.
Safety instrumented systems are designed to be emergency shutdown systems, and 
often they work properly. There are speciﬁ c standards worldwide that deﬁ ne how a 
safety-instrumented system should work. What does not exist is the same kind of stan-
dard for alarms and alarm management.
Doug Rothenberg has been in the forefront of research and standards making for 
alarm management in the process industries for many years. He did the pioneering work 
in the development and deployment of distributed control system (DCS) alarm manage-
ment technology from 1989 through the present. He also was a founding member of 
the Alarm Management Task Force and the ASM Consortium and is a voting member 
of ISA 18, the Alarm Management Standards Committee.
His book is a comprehensive treatment of the current best practices in industrial 
process control alarm management. Doug covers the entire alarm management pro-
cess from how to recognize the level of performance of existing systems through the 
methodology and procedures for redesigning (or designing new) state-of-the-practice 
alarm systems. You do not need any special or detailed experience in the conﬁ guration 
or speciﬁ cation of process control equipment. The ability to appreciate technical issues 
is important, but no prerequirement exists for any speciﬁ c technical, educational, or 
experiential background.
In this book, Doug elevates alarm management from a fragmented collection of 
procedures, metrics, and trial and error to the level of a technology discipline. This is the 
xxx    
Foreword
ﬁ rst book about alarm management to do so. Doug gives you the fundamental under-
pinnings that will provide a level of understanding that is independent of opinion and 
partial experiences. All critical tasks are explained, with examples and insight into what 
they mean. Alternatives are everywhere to enable industrial users to tailor-make their 
solutions for their particular sites.
Using this book, you will be able to understand how to rationalize alarms and how 
to work toward the same sort of human-factors engineering that has revolutionized 
cockpit design but is now applied to control rooms in industrial process plants.
If you work in a process plant, design process plants, or design, operate, or maintain 
control systems, this is your indispensable reference book.

Introduction
We warm ourselves by ﬁ res we did not build and drink from wells we did not dig.
—Ancient Semitic wisdom
T
his book embodies the current best practices of process control alarm systems for 
industrial manufacturing facilities. It is a comprehensive guide developed to help 
you understand, design, evaluate, and use alarm systems. The coverage is accurate 
and complete and, at the same time, easy to grasp. The book contains all the “what is” 
information about alarm management so that you will fully understand. There is an 
extensive “how to” that you can use to perform every aspect of alarm system redesign. 
The style is low key. The technology is down to earth, solid, and based on strong design 
fundamentals.
Some of you have experience with alarm projects. You’ve done work before others 
even knew alarm improvement was such an extraordinary opportunity to better opera-
tions. No doubt when you read this, you will ﬁ nd differences in what is suggested here in 
comparison to what you’ve done for your site. Please understand that this situation does 
not mean to imply that either of us might be wrong. It is just that now we understand 
the methodology better and have some very powerful and useful tools and procedures at 
our disposal. We do not have to do as much trial and error. New standards and practices 
are in place. We better understand how alarm management really works.
Right about now others might be asking, how in the world can a topic as obscure 
as alarm management possibly lead to an entire book? What can be so important and 
useful? It just so happens that alarm improvement is a powerful means toward a valuable 
end. It provides a useful way to better plant operations. Alarm management is one of 
those lucky ﬁ nds that yields wonderful prizes. Let me tell you why. Think about a time, 
many years ago, when travel was done mostly on foot, without maps, on dusty roads 
with forks and no signposts or mile markers. There were a number of ways to try to get 
to a town or village. One could simply follow a road and watch to see if it were becoming 
more traveled as one went along. One might be fortunate enough to happen upon a fel-
low traveler and inquire. If there were no traveler or no road, one might follow a stream 
to see what could be found. Depending on the lay of the land, it might be possible to 
xxxiv    
Introduction
head down into an inviting valley, or in the direction of chimneys smoking, or follow the 
hubbub to a busy market.
Like the stream, road, or fellow traveler, alarm management leads to the village—but 
in our case the village is signiﬁ cantly improved plant operations. There are, of course, 
other roads to better operation. Examples would be a desire to reduce long-term costs, 
a need to improve product quality or delivery schedules, a requirement to manage envi-
ronmental exposure, or the need to provide a signiﬁ cantly safer enterprise. Choose any 
one. Along the way, you will touch most of the same aspects you are going to touch by 
taking the alarm improvement path. Much of the beneﬁ ts will be similar. But a most 
important difference will be that the alarm improvement road, this road, is traveled 
enough so that there are good maps, effective signposts, and lots of fellow travelers. 
This road has also been carefully planned with good restaurants and comfortable motels. 
Enjoy the trip.
NOT A HANDBOOK
This is not a handbook.
Handbooks may deal with any topic, and are generally compendiums of infor-
mation in a particular ﬁ eld or about a particular technique. They are designed 
to be easily consulted and provide quick answers in a certain area. (Wikipedia)
This book is not a handbook because alarm management is not about afﬁ rming busi-
ness as usual. Nothing is wrong with business as usual, except that is how process con-
trol systems (PCS) alarm capabilities drifted away from their intended purpose and into 
the center stage of poor operations performance. Getting better is less about tinkering 
and polishing and more about rethinking and redesign. Alarm management now has a 
foundation and a body of implementation experiences. This text covers the entire alarm 
management process from recognition to action. The reader learns how to recognize 
the level of performance of existing systems as well as how to take action through the 
methodology and procedures for designing new state-of-the-practice alarm systems. To 
do this job well, you will need to know more than the highlights and have more than 
lots of lists and procedures.
AUDIENCE
This book was created for individuals with a general familiarity of modern process con-
trol systems and how operators use them to manage their plants. Readers need not have 
any special or detailed experience in the conﬁ guration or speciﬁ cation of process control 
equipment. The ability to appreciate technical issues is important, but no prerequire-
ment exists for any speciﬁ c technical, educational, or experiential background. The book 
is a comprehensive treatment of the current best practices. The text covers the entire 
alarm management process from how to recognize the level of performance of existing 
systems through the methodology and procedures for redesigning (or designing new) 
state-of-the-practice alarm systems.

Introduction
You will ﬁ nd the style and content useful and understandable. The majority of the 
material has been presented around the world to a wide audience in a variety of formats 
as industrial and professional short courses and workshops. Audiences have included 
plant operators, operations supervisors and managers, process controls technicians, 
instrument and control technicians and engineers, health and safety personnel, process 
engineers and engineering supervisors, all manner of support staff, and notably senior 
plant management. The material of this book has met with enthusiastic reception. If you 
are interested in alarm management, this is your source!
USEFULNESS
This work elevates alarm management from a fragmented collection of procedures, met-
rics, and trial and error to the level of a technology discipline. Fundamental under-
pinnings provide a level of understanding that is independent of opinion and partial 
experiences. All critical tasks are explained, with examples and insight into what they 
mean. Alternatives are everywhere to enable industrial users to tailor-make their solu-
tions for their particular sites.
Many of the leading power, chemical, mining, pharmaceuticals, and petroleum man-
ufacturing companies contributed to this best practice. There are a growing number of 
alarm management applications and improvement programs. They serve to excite the 
industrial community with the importance of good alarm system design. This text is a 
one-stop shop for alarm management practices from start to ﬁ nish. It includes important 
material for understanding and managing abnormal plant operations. It illustrates the 
serious importance of process control graphics in the management of plants.
Redesigning alarms will ensure that plant operators have an improved notiﬁ cation 
system to provide warning of abnormal operation. However, alarm improvement can-
not stand alone. Warning alone fails to ensure operational success. This broad coverage 
exposes the practitioner to all the additional key aspects and practices that work together. 
The value of this treatment derives from the combination of the delivery of a clear, work-
able, comprehensive alarm system design and the coverage of intimately related “enablers” 
that empower the operator to fully leverage the improved alarm system.
CONTENTS
This book is organized in three parts. Part I covers the alarm management problem. Part 
II lays out the solution. Part III provides the pathway to make it all real. There are twelve 
chapters. There is a natural progression of the work, with each chapter covering a speciﬁ c 
area. It is suggested that the reader cover the material in that order. However, each chap-
ter has value if read separately. This can be especially useful for those with a working knowl-
edge of the technology who are looking for more detail or greater depth in selected topics. 
The book provides a working guide for project planning and execution. Certain chapters 
work especially well as stand-alone treatments. Chapter 2, “Abnormal Situations,” chapter 
5, “Permission to Operate,” and chapter 12, “Situation Awareness,” are designed with 
this in mind. These topics bring out aspects of enterprise management that go beyond 
xxxvi    
Introduction
alarm systems in their overall importance. They elevate alarm improvement effectiveness 
to a level of value capable of delivering demonstrable beneﬁ t.
Each chapter begins with the mention of the key concepts that underlie the topic.1 
These key concepts are provided to assist the reader to clearly separate the concepts from 
the explanatory discussion. Taken as a whole, the set of key concepts could make up a 
shorthand bible of alarm management.
Part I: The Alarm Management Problem
Chapter 1, “Meet Alarm Management,” explores the basic reasons for considering improv-
ing your alarm system, introduces the four fundamental concepts that guides the process, 
and bridges the implementation over the distributed control system (DCS) and pro-
gramming logic controllers (PLC) controls platforms and the process types: continuous, 
discrete, and batch. Chapter 2, “Abnormal Situations,” links process operation abnor-
malities to alarm performance requirements. Along the way we pick up the important 
concept of how to use time in setting alarm activation levels. Chapter 3, “Strategy for 
Alarm Improvement,” brings us up to speed with the who, what, when, and how to 
effect alarm system redesign. The existing standards and best practices are also covered. 
Chapter 4, “Alarm Performance,” covers the useful scales for measuring both alarm sys-
tem design and operational performance.
Part II: The Alarm Management Solution
Chapter 5, “Permission to Operate,” provides a framework to cover an important need 
in plant operational protocol to ensure that unmanageable situations are avoided. Chap-
ter 6, “Alarm Philosophy,” covers how each enterprise will specify their chosen alarm 
design. Chapter 7, “Rationalization,” is the heart of building the new alarm designs. It 
covers the technical procedures for how alarms are chosen, conﬁ gured, documented, 
and folded back into the rest of the plant infrastructure. Chapter 8, “Enhanced Alarm 
Methods,” builds on the ﬁ rst-level alarm design to ensure that the alarm design accom-
modates to changes in plant situations.
Part III: Implementing Alarm Management
Chapter 9, “Implementation,” gets into the realities of taking a new alarm design and 
producing a new working alarm system ready to fully assist the operator. Chapter 10, 
“Life Cycle Management,” clears the way to understanding what is needed to keep 
a new alarm system working down the road so that it can deliver continuous opera-
tional beneﬁ t. Chapter 11, “Project Development,” provides alternative ways to produce 
a program for comprehensive alarm improvement, from start to ﬁ nish, that matches 
the enterprise’s way of conducting work projects. Chapter 12, “Situation Awareness,” 
rounds out the entire work by providing the understanding and technology for improv-
ing the operator’s ability to manage a process without undue reliance on alarms.

Introduction
BOOK DELIVERABLES
Upon completion, you will have a solid, clear foundational understanding of the pur-
pose of alarms, the rationale behind a state-of-the-practice design, and sufﬁ cient how-to 
knowledge to competently perform in the technology. This book is designed to provide 
a basis for the following competencies:
• Understanding the proper use of process control alarm systems
• Knowing the underlying deﬁ ning attributes and purpose of an alarm
• Appreciating the importance of effective alarm management
• Recognizing alarm system performance problems, including alarm ﬂ ood
• Becoming knowledgeable in the best practices for alarm system design
• Learning the value of alarm data diagnostic tools
• Understanding the entire process for designing and executing an alarm improve-
ment project
• Understanding the inﬂ uence of good graphic interface design on plant operability 
and effective situation awareness
• Becoming a qualiﬁ ed participant in alarm improvement teams
IMPORTANT WORD
Please note that this book is not intended in any way to offer advice or recommenda-
tions as to the appropriateness or lack of appropriateness of including or excluding any 
speciﬁ c alarm for any site. The choice of which aspects to alarm for the plant or process, 
the parameters of that alarm, the proper operator response to correct the alarm condi-
tion, and all other details of that alarm must be retained wholly by qualiﬁ ed, authorized 
members of the plant staff, who must act with full knowledge of their speciﬁ c plant 
conﬁ guration, process conditions, equipment, and applicable statutory practices and 
requirements.
No single work is capable of conveying the entire collective experience and impor-
tant nuances necessary for success. After you read this book, it is recommended that 
plants with intentions or plans for alarm improvement seek additional speciﬁ c guidance 
and experience from knowledgeable experts.

CHAPTER 1
Meet Alarm Management
If you need a new machine and don’t buy it, you pay for it anyway but never get to 
use it.
—Henry Ford
A
n alarm is an announcement to the operator initiated by a process variable (or 
measurement) passing a deﬁ ned limit as it approaches an undesirable or unsafe 
value. The announcement includes audible sounds, visual indications (e.g., ﬂ ash-
ing lights and text, background or text color changes, and other graphic or pictorial 
changes), and messages. The announced problem requires operator action. An alarm is a 
construction by which an aspect of manufacturing operation is identiﬁ ed and conﬁ gured 
in a binary way to be either “in alarm” or “cleared” (i.e., not in alarm). The condition 
of in alarm is passed to an operator via intrusive sounds and notices placed on video dis-
play units or other devices to gain attention. The operator can manage these sounds and 
notices only via speciﬁ c “silence the alarm” or “acknowledge the alarm” actions using 
the existing, planned infrastructure of the alarm platform. Usually, this alarm platform is 
an integral part of the process control system (PCS) infrastructure.
The PCS alarm system is a vital and productive tool for managing industrial process 
control plants. Through several unique cooperative endeavors, industry has identiﬁ ed a 
best practice for alarm system design. This design utilizes conﬁ guration changes, alarm 
reprioritization and balancing, alarm reductions, graphics modiﬁ cations, online ﬁ ltering, 
and decision support aids. Alarms perform the vital function of operational integrity 
monitoring. Properly designed alarms will notify the operator of abnormal situations 
with enough time to successfully manage them.

1.1 KEY CONCEPTS
Alarms are for the operator
The alarm system must be off-limits for all plant uses 
that do not directly require the operator to process 
actively the situation or information.
All of the objectives of 
alarm improvement are just 
good engineering
There is nothing that alarm improvement asks 
of plant operators that is over and above what 
constitutes effective plant design and operation. 
Somehow, bits and pieces are overlooked or shortcuts 
are taken. Poor or inadequate alarm performance 
is just the way we find out about these things. The 
technology of alarm improvement provides a focused, 
compact way of getting that job done.
Alarm redesign is based 
on important fundamental 
concepts
Alarm redesign is based on four powerful concepts: 
only notify important conditions, notify in time, 
respond, and provide guidance.
Initial alarm system 
performance matters little
Few, if any, unimproved alarm systems have been 
designed to meet the fundamental concepts; therefore, 
reducing alarm annoyance and activation rates only 
treats symptoms of a nonperforming design.
Improving alarms alone will 
not provide enough benefit
Good alarm systems only work when the entire plant 
infrastructure supports good operation.

1.2 ALARM PERFORMANCE PROBLEMS
Ask almost any operator if the alarm system is working for or against good process opera-
tion. The response you are likely to get is surprise—not because the question is unclear 
but because it took you so long to ask. Ask control engineers or process engineers that 
same question and they are more and more often going to say that the alarm system 
needs ﬁ xing. Ask experts in industrial accident investigation and they will tell you that 
the lack of adequate performance of the alarm system is contributory to a signiﬁ cant 
number of industrial accidents and major calamities. They will quickly suggest that you 
make plans to evaluate your PCS alarm system.
Symptoms
Right off the bat, there are clear indicators of alarm problems. If your site has any of 
these symptoms, there is cause for concern. If you can observe three or more of them, 
there is much serious work to be done.
• Alarm activations occur without need for operator action.
• There is no plantwide philosophy for the alarm system.
• There are no clear guidelines for when to add an alarm and how to do it.
• There are no controls for removing existing alarms.
• Operating procedures are not tied to alarm activations.
• When alarms activate, the operator is not always sure what to do about them.
• Seemingly routine operations produce a large number of alarm activations that 
serve no useful purpose.
• Minor operating upsets produce a signiﬁ cant number of alarm activations.
• Signiﬁ cant operating upsets produce an unmanageable number of alarm activations.
• Some alarms remain active for long periods of time.
• When nothing is wrong, there are active alarms.
Evidence
We look for evidence of alarm problems in four places. Two are quite objective; two are 
subtle.
• Number of alarms configured in the PCS database. How many tags are alarmed? How 
many alarms are conﬁ gured for each alarmed tag? How close are the alarm limits to 
actual process limits? How closely is priority matched to actual operational risk?
Alarm Management for Process Control
6    
• Number of alarm activations. What is the hour-by-hour average occurrence of 
alarms? How often do alarm ﬂ oods occur? How many alarms occur during a ﬂ ood? 
What is the distribution of alarm priorities during ﬂ oods?
• Operators’ ability to gain insight and guidance from the alarm system prior, during, 
and after an upset. If alarms are not active, how sure are the operators that the pro-
cess is normal? When alarms activate, do they provide assistance for the operator to 
diagnose and remedy problems? Does the alarm system itself—by excessive activa-
tions, lack of proper activation, or existence of meaningless active alarms—interfere 
with or delay proper production management?
• Operators’ ability to determine how the process is actually performing from other tools 
and PCS capabilities. What is in place that permits operators to view and under-
stand how the process is actually performing? If there were no alarm system at all, 
how easily could the operator determine how the process was performing and how 
close it might be to an abnormal condition?
1.3 REASONS FOR ALARM IMPROVEMENT
No alarm system should be asked to overcome the intricacies and power of the uncon-
trolled effects of nature or the failed constructs of man. Pandora’s box cannot be closed. 
Humpty Dumpty cannot be put back together. Yet the future is not grim. History is not 
written soley for the purpose of conveying the worst from our past. Alarm management 
is thus charged with aiding and abetting our best efforts for accommodating the worst 
and setting reasonable courses for recovery. Within these pages, you will ﬁ nd the con-
cepts, ideas, and practical approaches to bring what is possible to you. You are encour-
aged to recognize that your best will neither prevent nor minimize all the effects of 
misdirection. You are empowered to believe that your best efforts will yield nourishing 
fruit. As Larry O’Brien and Dave Woll say in Alarm Management Strategies,
Alarm management is one of the most undervalued and underutilized aspects of 
process automation today. In most cases, alarm systems do not receive the atten-
tion and resources that are warranted. This is understandable, because alarming 
appears to be a deceptively simple activity. Many plants still use the alarm manage-
ment philosophy developed by the engineering ﬁ rm when the plant was built.
As alarm systems become less effective, they diminish the effectiveness of all 
automation.1
How Alarms Fit into Process Operating Situation
Safety shutdown systems are designed to close down affected plant operations in the 
unfortunate situation where that operation is too close to an unsafe situation, an envi-
ronmentally challenging condition, or a mode of operation that threatens the ﬁ nan-
cial integrity of the plant. Once a shutdown occurs, the plant operation is signiﬁ cantly 
curtailed. This usually results in a loss of production, some equipment damage, and a 
Chapter 1: Meet Alarm Management
   7
considerable degree of internal investigation. Prior to restart, there might be repairs, 
changes to equipment and procedures, and of course lots of administrative work.
Most plants would choose to avoid a shutdown if it could be done without risk. 
Abnormal situations rarely present themselves without some warning. But those warn-
ing messages and signs are not always picked up by the operator. They are often subtle. 
Sometimes they are downright abstract or confusing. Rarely are they front and center 
enough to be found in time and remedied. However, in a well-designed alarm system, 
one designed from the point of view of alarming abnormal situations rather than just 
abnormal variables, a signiﬁ cantly greater number of those early warning messages about 
abnormal plant operation can be seen. In this way, the alarm system might be considered 
to serve as a presafety shutdown system. Alarms are a way for the operator to see an 
important problem building and have an opportunity to keep it from leading to a more 
serious plant situation.
The process control system is set to the operating target (ﬁ g. 1.3.1). These controls 
are intended to keep production within the good operating region. Operation is still 
ﬁ ne in the safe operating region, but the product is less valuable or more costly to pro-
duce. Few, if any, alarms should be designed to activate as the process approaches and 
appears likely to cross the boundary between good operation and safe operation. Alarm-
ing here is technically difﬁ cult and often results in many unnecessary alarm activations. 
The control system should be capable of responding to changes and disturbances that 
cause movement away from the operating target. Let it do its work. If tighter control 
is needed, either modify the controls or ask the operator to be more diligent and make 
more frequent adjustments to the controls (e.g., setpoint adjustments, supplemented 
with minor ﬁ eld adjustments).
Most alarms should be set to activate as soon as the process moves close to and 
appears likely to cross the boundary between safe operation and upset operation. At 
this point, there is a very high likelihood that the control system is unable to manage 
the situation properly. Manual operator intervention is required. The alarms are there 
Figure 1.3.1. Operating region versus modality of remediation
Alarm Management for Process Control
8    
to ensure that the operator does not miss these situations. If manual intervention by the 
operator is still not likely to ensure that the process remains within the upset region, 
alarms are be used to mark the likely movement through the boundary from upset 
operation to dangerous operation. Any plant movement from dangerous operation into 
damaging operation should be managed by the emergency shutdown system. Alarms are 
too late here, so none are needed.
Alarm Management
Alarm management is all about the understanding, design, implementation, and opera-
tion of an effective alerting capability for production plant operators. These alerts are 
intended to notify operators of situations and events that require operator attention 
in an explicit way within an acceptable time frame. This book is written for users and 
designers of industrial process control systems. These systems are traditionally comprised 
of equipment to measure plant conditions, other equipment to transfer those measure-
ments to devices that are capable of interpreting the measurements, still other devices 
that employ these interpretations and other information to manipulate yet other process 
conditions in order to realize an appropriate plant operation, and ﬁ nally equipment that 
permits operators and others to view all measurements and intervene as needed.
Being more pragmatic, alarm management is therefore the determination of (a) all 
plant conditions that will be alarmed, (b) the parametric setting for the activation of each 
alarm event, (c) the classiﬁ cation of the importance of each alarm event, and (d) the col-
lation and presentation of information that documents the best understanding of how 
to successfully manage the event.
Benefits
Alarm improvement works. It can deliver clear, auditable beneﬁ ts. Let’s cut to the chase, 
as they say. Plants that redesign their alarm systems using the best practices in coopera-
tion with energetic and understanding personnel are seeing payouts in reduced main-
tenance costs and lower insurance rates. You were probably expecting things like better 
operation and higher quality and stuff like that. OK, that too. However, the real mes-
sage, and the one that in a very noncircular way proves out the best practices, is that 
maintenance and insurance reﬂ ect the biggest operational integrity risks for enterprises.
Reduced Maintenance Costs
One of the biggest surprises in alarm management is the serious reduction in plant main-
tenance costs after improvement. Yes, it is easy after the fact to see how this might be true. 
With the operator able to catch errant operation earlier and do a better job of bringing 
things back in line, it is not too great a leap to see that the equipment is less stressed. There-
fore, operators encounter fewer overpressure events, fewer high-temperature excursions, 
and less pump cavitation. Less-stressed equipment breaks down less often. The interesting 
Chapter 1: Meet Alarm Management
   9
thing here is that in the past, operators did not expect to see these beneﬁ ts. But now it has 
become obvious—alarm improvement works.
As you will discover later on in this book, improving plant maintenance is a vital 
requirement for gaining improved alarm system performance. It is a subversion of the 
alarm system to ask it to cover for all of the broken stuff, all of the missing but important 
stuff, and all of the other aspects that were designed into a plant but over time got lost. 
Maintenance is important. Going into alarm improvement, one might be concerned 
that maintenance costs would likely go up. Plants would need to ﬁ x everything that was 
broken. Repairs cost money; pay a little now. But what most do not realize is that the 
costs of ﬁ xing up return the favor in kind!
General results: within 6 months after alarm improvement work is commissioned 
and smoothly operating, plants see a 5% to 15% sustained reduction in unplanned main-
tenance costs.
Lower Insurance Costs
You might be new to alarm management. Your insurance company more than likely is 
not! Figures bouncing around in Europe reveal that the lack of an alarm management 
program increases premiums by substantial amounts. Figures for the United States are 
less, but U.S. experiences are limited. Insurance companies have followed the pacesetters 
in implementing alarm management. The 1999 publication of the Engineering Equip-
ment Materials Users’ Association (EEMUA) 191 guidelines2 put out the word and 
showed everyone how to get started. As the numbers came in, they told the story. Again, 
this points to the fact that alarm improvement works.
General results: European manufacturers are seeing a 20% to 30% reduction in their risk 
operations insurance due to implementation of EEMUA-compliant alarm improvement.
Capture Workforce Knowledge
Manufacturing in many parts of the world is diminishing as industrial activity geographi-
cally redistributes in our mobile world. For a variety of reasons, the workforce in impor-
tant segments of industry is aging. Fewer young workers are entering. At the same time, 
a disproportionate number of highly experienced workers will be leaving their positions 
through retirement, illness, or attractive cost-cutting management incentives. A great 
deal of unwritten knowledge will leave when they leave. According to Power Engineer-
ing3 (ﬁ g. 1.3.2), nearly 20% of the entire workforce will have reached normal retirement 
age by 2015 and nearly 40% by 2020.
Alarm redesign, by design, provides a comprehensive, structured way to capture 
important operating knowledge. The entire activity of identifying abnormal situations 
through alarms and what the operator is supposed to do to manage them properly is a 
key part of the rationalization activity. So, not only will the present operating team have 
the beneﬁ t of this information, but as each new member moves to the board, they too 
will be able to understand and use this valuable asset. For the reader who would like to 
have an advanced view of what this knowledge looks like, you may refer to the alarm 
response sheet in chapter 7.

Shift Handover
If you are an operator, you know how important it is to receive a full brieﬁ ng from the 
operator you are replacing. Even if you are coming on after a relatively quiet shift, a lot 
might have happened earlier that you would beneﬁ t from knowing about later. As it hap-
pens, the actual process of shift handover can be a very haphazard event. For some plants, 
the two operators barely have time to wave as they pass. Other plants have found the ben-
eﬁ t of doing this well and arrange for an informal overlap of operators’ time. Interestingly 
enough, operators have found it so useful that they do it without additional pay!
Plants have discovered that a well-designed alarm system will provide an important 
orientation edge to the handover. Operators discuss alarms that have activated during 
the shift. They discuss any alarms that might have been disabled, inhibited, or otherwise 
outside of their normal operating regime. The alarm information provides a checklist of 
items not to be missed. Moreover, those items are likely at the heart of the operability 
of the enterprise.
1.4 A BRIEF HISTORY OF ALARM MANAGEMENT
The year 1988 is the generally accepted earliest date for the ﬁ rst recognition of alarm 
system problems. Yes, there were those few early pioneers who faced operational difﬁ cul-
ties and traced some or most of them to alarm system deﬁ ciencies. And these pioneers 
Figure 1.3.2. Aging workforce in U.S. power industry
Chapter 1: Meet Alarm Management
   11
certainly made improvements to their plants based on this understanding. However, their 
impact was limited to their parochial interests. Little alarm was raised to the body techni-
cal, as it were. This all changed in late 1988 and into 1989. A surprisingly large number of 
individuals from a broad range of industries who were working to better understand the 
way process upsets were being managed by operators came to realize that the alarm system 
itself might be a problem. By 1990, sites had worked out the basics of alarm improvement, 
and a few actually had begun to execute projects. But all this came to a surprising halt in 
early 1991. It was discovered that it was not possible to actually implement most alarm 
improvement plans within any currently used, conventional process control platform.
In 1991, they joined together in what is known as the Alarm Management Task 
Force (appendix 8). On a warm afternoon in mid-October that year in Phoenix, Arizona, 
the ﬁ rst of many meetings took place. It was represented by oil reﬁ ning companies, 
chemical manufacturing companies, a controls equipment manufacturing company, and 
power companies from almost all segments of their respective industries. Over the next 
few years, they worked out the fundamentals of alarming, helped shape the requirements 
for alarm analysis tools and controls infrastructure, and plowed their way through the 
realization that prevention was the best alarm response possible. Along the way, the 
Abnormal Situation Management (ASM) Consortium was born and important para-
digms were set for production management. By the mid-1990s, third-party software 
companies developed and reﬁ ned important alarm capture and analysis tools.
In a parallel track, Brookhaven National Laboratory4 became fully involved in devel-
oping a better understanding of alarm systems following the Three Mile Island accident.
Using the collective knowledge from the Alarm Management Task Force, the ASM 
joined with leading technologists in Europe to support an EEMUA initiative. In 1999, 
EEMUA collated and published the ﬁ rst and most-recognized guide to alarm systems. 
It was revised in 2007. To date, Publication 191 functions as the de facto best practice. 
Unfortunately, the availability of good guidance does not necessarily lead to a wide-
spread adoption. Thus, many industrial nations are now seeking to codify requirements 
that they believe will lead to improved safe operation of industrial plants.
1.5 THE “MANAGEMENT” IN ALARM MANAGEMENT
The management part of the phrase alarm management is a bit of a misnomer. Alarm 
management is a design and implementation process for the entire redesign of the por-
tion of the process control system capability that is used to alert operators to conditions 
where an alarm is needed. The minute-by-minute managing of an alarm is but one small 
part of this much more encompassing technology. The full process includes the following:
 
1. Benchmark analysis of present alarm system performance, including its impact on 
production, safety, and environmental
 
2. Development of a philosophy governing the operation of the enterprise sufﬁ -
cient to specify a design basis for the required alarm system and supporting plant 
infrastructure
 
3. Selection of which variables to alarm
Alarm Management for Process Control
12    
 
4. Setting of alarm limits
 
5. Setting of alarm priorities
 
6. Determination of recommended operator actions
 
7. Design of advanced techniques to facilitate improved alarm performance
 
8. Addition of plant condition monitors and decision support tools
 
9. Incorporation of new alarm system design back into the plant infrastructure
 10. Continual audits, assessments, and modiﬁ cations for improvement
Alarm management is a process. When we successfully do alarm management, we end 
up with a fully functioning alarm system suitable to meet production requirements to 
better realize enterprise goals.
1.6 ALARM DESIGN ROADMAP
Here is the basic roadmap we will use to structure the alarm system improvement work. 
It captures the key steps and order found to be most useful and best at leading to success. 
See Figure 1.6.1. The entry ticket into the alarm redesign game is to know your alarm 
problem and understand how large it appears to be. Assemble some data, analyze it, and 
reach preliminary conclusions. If there are sufﬁ cient grounds (and that is part of what 
this book is all about), you will take your story and go to management.
Figure 1.6.1. Alarm redesign roadmap
Chapter 1: Meet Alarm Management
   13
If your power of persuasion is strong enough and your case evident enough, man-
agement should offer up a commitment (let you propose a project and approve it) and 
help with the development of a site alarm improvement philosophy. Project in hand, you 
will continue (clockwise) and assemble a large amount of data sufﬁ cient to demonstrate 
most, if not all, of your site’s alarm and related deﬁ ciencies. Next step is to analyze that 
data and reach conclusions that will assist you to focus your redesign project efforts 
where they are most needed.
The ﬁ rst actual changes to be made in your alarm management work appear in the 
next step—rationalization. This is a three-legged item. And the ﬁ rst leg is housekeeping, 
a vernacular word that means “ﬁ x everything that is broken.” It is simple. We should 
not ask the alarm system to act as a substitute for correctable defects. The next two legs 
involve the redesign of alarms to ﬁ t the new requirements and the addition of any spe-
cialized alarm processing needed to better handle unnecessary alarms and alarm ﬂ oods. 
Except for housekeeping, everything we have done so far is on paper. We are ready to 
do it, but not yet. Implementation is when we take all of our new design and make it 
real. The last step is actually the one that we will use continuously: maintain beneﬁ ts by 
monitoring, improving, and correcting.
1.7 AUDIENCE FOR THIS BOOK
This book is written for individuals with a general familiarity with modern distributed 
process control systems and how operators employ them to manage their plants. It is a 
comprehensive treatment of the current best practices. The work covers the entire alarm 
management process from how to recognize the current level of performance of existing 
systems through the methodology and procedures for redesigning (or designing new) 
state-of-the-practice alarm systems. Readers need not have any special or detailed experi-
ence in the conﬁ guration or speciﬁ cation of PCS equipment. The ability to appreciate 
technical issues is important, but there is no prerequirement for any speciﬁ c technical, 
educational, or experiential background. If you are interested in alarm management, this 
is your book!
Anyone with a desire to better understand and improve PCS alarm systems will 
ﬁ nd the style and content useful and understandable. The majority of the material has 
been used for several years and presented to a wide audience in a variety of formats as 
industrial and professional short courses and workshops. Audiences have included plant 
operators, operations supervisors and managers, PCS technicians, instrument and con-
trol technicians and engineers, health and safety personnel, process engineers and engi-
neering supervisors, all manner of support staff, and, notably, senior plant management. 
This material has been presented to international audiences with enthusiastic success.
1.8 IMPORTANCE OF ALARM MANAGEMENT
At the end of the day, when the alarm system has been redesigned and implemented, 
the plant will have a tool that signiﬁ cantly improves production performance. This 
Alarm Management for Process Control
14    
improvement will be seen both during normal operation (these periods will be longer 
and less eventful) and during upset periods (they should be less severe, less frequent, and 
better managed). We will see improved operator display screens that assist production 
personnel to ascertain plant operating conditions before most signiﬁ cant upsets occur. 
And, to return to the opening message, good alarm systems pay off in reduced mainte-
nance and insurance costs.
When you think about it, a large percentage of currently installed PCSs provide only 
limited information regarding normal operation. It is up to the operator to search out 
those trends and critical variables and use intuition, experience, and insight to determine 
how normal things really are. As simple as it is to say, this is a difﬁ cult task to do. Not many 
of us can do it; even fewer can do it well enough to consistently manage even everyday 
problems. To make matters more difﬁ cult, plants are becoming more complicated, produc-
tion requirements more demanding, and qualiﬁ ed personnel harder to justify and retain.
Still not convinced? Let us take a look at some of the statistics. It is not unusual for 
a medium-sized petrochemical company consisting of about six separate sites (reﬁ neries, 
chemical plants, etc.) to accumulate US$50,000,000 to $100,000,000 in yearly losses 
due to plant upsets and other production accidents. Alternatively, calculated another 
way, the generally recognized loss ﬁ gure is 3% to 5% of throughput. On a U.S. national 
level, this number is pegged at around $20,000,000,000 annually, year in and year out. 
If this is not signiﬁ cant enough to have an impact on your decision to be concerned, 
consider that many experts believe that these ﬁ gures dramatically underestimate the real 
situation. Moreover, not included in these numbers are the rare tragic incidents like 
Bhopal and Valdez. Increasingly, the performance of the alarm system itself has been 
identiﬁ ed as a signiﬁ cant contributor.
Alarm improvement is a big deal. It involves careful planning, steady commitment, 
adequate resources, full cooperation of site players, ability to modify weak infrastructure 
supporting components, and an understanding that this is a lifestyle change, not just a 
once-through project. So now you ask, “What if there are only one or two things that I 
can do? I cannot support a full alarm redesign; in fact, I’m a few years away from that. 
Can you recommend a plan in the interim?”
The answer might surprise you. Before we get to that, let us understand that the 
bottom line here is not to get another alarm system designed. The prime objective is to 
signiﬁ cantly improve production integrity. Improved integrity is the mantra of a good 
alarm system, but the alarm system itself it is not necessarily the ﬁ rst step. Here is my 
list; stop at any place where you run out of money. But stop at the risk of enterprise 
operational integrity.
• Fix all broken equipment and keep it running well.
• Implement a policy of only operating when the plant is known to be operable (see 
chapter 5).
• Improve the operator’s ability be aware of the plant operational situation (see 
chapter 12).
• Redesign the alarm system (see this book).

1.9 FUNDAMENTALS OF ALARM MANAGEMENT
We design successful alarm systems by building our work from four fundamental pre-
cepts. I am sure that when you ﬁ rst became aware of alarm management, you might not 
have been certain that it had much to do with anything real, much less vitally useful, to 
you and the plant you support. Alarm improvement is a discipline with important tech-
nology that, when used, will signiﬁ cantly improve success.
As you do the job correctly, you will come to appreciate the importance of ensuring 
an effective operator support infrastructure. Operating procedures, training, safe opera-
tion, screen graphics and design, and maintenance will take on an entirely new level of 
importance. New concepts called “safe park” and “permission to operate” will become 
an integral part of your lexicon. You will come to believe that it not only will work, but 
its work will provide your plant with a level of operational integrity that is essential to a 
safe and proﬁ table enterprise. You will wonder how it was possible that anyone would 
expect a plant to run well without this new approach.
Proper alarm design is a straightforward engineering process. Everything you know 
about engineering, about system design, and about project execution remains useful. 
Intuition is going to be useful. Moreover, while there are some who believe that alarm 
improvement is a complicated, delicate, and unforgiving process, it is certainly not. Yes, 
experience can be useful. If it is available, embrace it. At the end of the day, doing things 
well is easily within your personal reach.
Bottom Line of Alarm Management
This book is all about how to identify and conﬁ gure vital alarms. Please, do not confuse 
“vital” with “emergency” or any other identiﬁ er that conveys extreme danger or loss. 
Vital simply announces to the world that this aspect of the plant, if not managed, will 
lead to operation that the enterprise has deemed to be unacceptable. Nothing more. If 
every alarm conﬁ gured for a plant represented a vital aspect of plant operation and was 
engineered well, there would be no alarm management problems. No matter how many 
alarms there were, they all would be needed. If that many alarms would be too much for 
an operator to handle, then either the plant, the controls infrastructure, or the opera-
tions management would need modiﬁ cation.
Fundamentals
Right from the beginning, you are going to see every fundamental of importance for 
proper alarm management. This might be the ﬁ rst book you have ever read where the 
punch line—the essence of the story—is revealed in the very ﬁ rst chapter. There are four 
fundamentals—four precepts. Together they form the foundation of everything we need 
to know about the subject. They govern all successful alarm system designs. Knowing 
them should resolve almost every simple and usually every difﬁ cult decision you will face 
in understanding and designing new systems that work.
Alarm Management for Process Control
16    
• Precept 1: Require action. Every alarm requires timely operator action, and that 
action must be a necessary one.
• Precept 2: Provide enough time for success. Every alarm activation must occur in time 
to permit the operator to successfully remedy the situation, if that remedy is at all 
a reasonable outcome (given the realities of the situation).
• Precept 3: Provide information. Adequate information must be provided to the 
operator to work the alarm.
• Precept 4: Alarm only important things. Only alarm important conditions/situations.
Precept 1: Require Action
Precept 1 means that only when operator action is required should the potential alarm 
be conﬁ gured as an alarm. This does not work both ways, however. The point will 
quickly be made that not every (and certainly not even most) operator action need be 
preceded by an alarm. Rather, the operator is primarily responsible for understanding 
the operation of his unit and maintaining good order in that unit. Alarms are not to be 
considered as any indicator of good or bad operation. Even perfect alarm selection and 
design are not meant to be surrogates for effective operator vigilance in maintaining 
awareness of the true operational situation of the plant.
Precept 2: Provide Enough Time for Success
Now that we know what constitutes an alarm, the second precept tells us how we must 
conﬁ gure and support the alarm so that it will provide the requisite beneﬁ ts. For this 
requirement to be met, every alarm must be conﬁ gured to activate in time for the opera-
tor to understand and implement proper corrective action and give the process enough 
time to respond. This, in turn, tells the alarm designer when to activate the alarm and 
what information and other operator support are needed to ensure that the abnormal 
situation could be successfully managed.
Figure 1.9.1. Alarm design foundation fundamentals
Chapter 1: Meet Alarm Management
   17
Precept 3: Provide Information
An alarm activates, the operator is alerted, and the system is designed so there is enough 
time to manage the situation. At the same time, we need to provide all of the background 
information and current “what to do” information so that the operator can do the job.
Precept 4: Alarm Only Important Things
Only important abnormalities should be alarmed. Why? Well, without this restriction, 
we can be true to the preceding three precepts yet be free to alarm any event for which 
the operator has an action and for which we can provide a timely warning. There are 
so many nice things to warn the operator about that no one would have the slightest 
trouble providing a large number of alarms, and we did just that in the past. We provided 
wake-up alarms everywhere we could and we realarmed them if we thought the operator 
might have forgotten about them. Now, with precept 4, we place a value on each alarm. 
By appropriately understanding value, the alarm system is self-constrained in the number 
of alarms.
What should deﬁ ne a candidate alarm? A candidate alarm must represent any 
unwanted situation of importance that rises above a minimum threshold of impact and 
that can be announced by an alarm. Moreover, without an alarm, the operator is unlikely 
to observe this situation on his own.
Operator Action
Precept 1 requires all valid alarms to have an operator action. But to what operator 
actions does it refer? Suppose we always require operators to look at their watches and 
write down the difference between their watch time and the alarm time. That is an 
action, isn’t it? A wave is an action. A look is an action. OK, you get the idea. We will 
need to nail down the meaning of operator action to get this right.
Operator actions can be broken down into two broad categories: primary and sec-
ondary. Operator action in response to an alarm must be a primary action. That is, in 
most instances, when an alarm activates, if the operator must usually respond with a 
primary operator action (see below), then the alarm is a proper alarm. Any alarm that is 
not a proper alarm should not have been conﬁ gured as an alarm in the ﬁ rst place. But 
you already knew that! Let us formalize what actions are all about.
Primary Action
A primary operator action is one that directly modiﬁ es or changes something physical in 
the plant. Primary actions include starting something, stopping something, modifying 
something, and closely examining something with the intent of doing any of the earlier 
things on this list. Typical primary actions include putting a controller in manual, start-
ing a pump, shutting a valve, reducing a controller setpoint, breaking a cascade loop, 
waiting longer to initiate a task or initiating a task earlier, or any number of the other 
things operators do to manage plants with problems.
Alarm Management for Process Control
18    
Just to be sure we get this right, an operator can closely watch an abnormal process 
variable with the intent of jumping in and making adjustments should it range too far 
out of bounds but never actually make an adjustment. This counts because it is a situa-
tion that probably needs adjustments when it becomes abnormal. The operator retains 
control over when, how much, and even if an action is needed.
Secondary Action
A secondary operator action is any act that is not a primary action. Secondary actions 
include communicating with others, scheduling something contemporaneously, thinking 
about something, taking note of an event or condition or situation, and the like. Secondary 
actions may involve calling maintenance to come and do something routine, reminding an 
outside operator to blow down a sump, or any number of other things that occupy opera-
tors during the normal course of their shifts. We can split hairs on this, but let’s move on.
A secondary operator action is not considered secondary when it is combined with a 
primary operator action—that is, if an operator performs a primary action along with a 
secondary one. Together, they are to be considered a primary action.
Importance of the Fundamentals
OK, that is it. These concepts reveal it all. Everything else in this book, and in alarm 
management in general, is commentary. At any time, when there is uncertainty about 
what to do or how to do it, refer to the precepts. Any decision of consequence can be 
derived from them. This is not to say that the rest of the book is now unimportant. This 
Figure 1.9.2. Operator action types
Chapter 1: Meet Alarm Management
   19
book will show you how the fundamentals lead to the necessary understanding, tools, 
and insight to be successful. Contained within these chapters is a wealth of insight and 
practical methods. Using them will keep you honest to the precepts as well as save an 
enormous amount of time and effort in doing the important work of alarm design. 
This book brings to life what you will need to understand alarms and to design effec-
tive alarm systems. The precepts are about what to do. The rest of this book is about 
how to do it well.
1.10 DESIGN FOR HUMAN LIMITATIONS
A painter or writer can start with a blank sheet of paper, an empty screen, or a blank 
palate. An engineer or system designer can start with an approach that is limited only by 
what is believed to be in conformance with the rules of nature, economic viability, and 
good citizenship in a community. Of course, this situation is not as entirely unmanaged 
as these opening words would suggest. Good engineering practice is important. To 
follow what has been done successfully before is wise counsel, but that is not enough. 
The deﬁ ning guidance will easily yield to discovery as soon as the designer insists that 
his creation be usable by the humans intended to use it. When all decisions have been 
made, the resulting design must ﬁ t the user’s ability to successfully use it. Hence, you 
will ﬁ nd that all design goals and performance metrics for alarm management will be 
easily derived by considering whether or not a person can use them.
1.11 ALARM MANAGEMENT AND SIX SIGMA
One need not understand or apply any of the speciﬁ c terminology and explicit practices 
of Six Sigma to do successful alarm management work. However, for sites with an active 
Six Sigma program, it is nice to know how the two relate. The Motorola Company 
developed Six Sigma as a business management strategy in 1986. They sought a more 
structured and updated methodology to focus the concepts and philosophy of the early 
quality giants: Deming, Crosby, Taguchi, Juran, and others.
With one important clariﬁ cation, alarm management processes are an excellent ﬁ t 
with Six Sigma. That clariﬁ cation is that alarm improvement (or design) is not driven by 
the actual performance data. Alarm improvement requires an explicit design methodology. 
The normal alarm events are usually considered to be data. However, any attempts to improve 
alarm performance cannot transcend a design that fails to comply with the fundamentals. 
Consider a civil engineering example. Improving highway bridges would be driven, not 
by bridge degradation and collapse data, but by the process of taking that information, 
uncovering root causes, and then modifying designs. Alarm improvement is this way as 
well. See Chris Wilson’s article5 for a broader discussion on this topic.
The term Six Sigma is derived from the use of  (the Greek alphabetic character 
sigma) in statistics. Very simply stated, if something is within a tolerance of one , it is 
31% efﬁ cient (31% close to what is desired), which is not very close. Two  would be 
better than 69%. Six  is 99.9997%—extremely close! A process that is Six Sigma is

20    
understood to have been designed to deliver 6 beneﬁ ts. Six Sigma utilizes two vari-
ants of a work process with acronyms DMAIC and DMADV. DMADV is used for 
processes that have not yet been developed; DMAIC is for processes that exist but 
need improvement.
Table 1.11.2 shows how alarm management and Six Sigma line up. Both alarm man-
agement and Six Sigma share the importance of top-down leadership, the necessity of

dedicated champions, and the requirement for proper training in and use of the technol-
ogy. They are both designed for success.
1.12 CONTROLS PLATFORMS
Automatic process controls come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes. The variations 
start at the single loop contained in a stand-alone, separate box and progress up to tens 
of thousands of loops in a tightly integrated electronic and communications infrastruc-
ture. They include conﬁ gurable built-in alarms and alerts. They might interface with an 
operator via a simple display of switches and lights. Or they might employ a sophisticated 
electronic display of panels, screens, sounds, and more. But they all have the same objec-
tive: keeping the plant properly operating. Since keeping something properly operating 
is not always easy, the equipment provides a way to inform the operator that things are 
not quite right. These we call alarms. Any way you look at it, it is not only possible but 
usual that the alarms part of things can become a problem.
Whenever alarms start to get in the way of effective operator activities, there is an 
alarm management problem. It matters little which controls platform or controls design 
is used. The concepts and technology advanced in this book are going to be useful and 
valid for the various controls designs and hardware/software platforms.
PLC versus DCS
The two workhorses of industrial controls are the programmable logic controller (PLC) 
and the distributed control system (DCS). At one time, PLCs were rarely used for heavy-
duty continuous manufacturing operations and DCSs were seldom used for high-density 
sequencing and other intensive, stepwise production operations. The scale of PLCs was 
mostly on the small side. This meant that a lot of PLCs were required to manage an 
operation with a large number of items. The scale of DCSs was mostly on the very large 
side. This meant that they required too much cost and infrastructure for smaller opera-
tions. However, today, both structural platforms have been developed to be more scal-
able, and both have evolved to provide more of the other’s features. Consequently, it 
should not be surprising to ﬁ nd that both alarm problems and alarm management solu-
tions are not substantially different between them. This is not to say that there are not 
differences that bear discussion and special approaches. There are and they do.
The key differences derive from both inherent differences in the hardware platforms 
and associated equipment and the tendency to use PLCs for manufacturing facilities that 
have a large amount of equipment that is used for only parts of the manufacturing cycle 
or used for only specialized products that share the same controls infrastructure. The list 
includes the following:
• PLCs have either a dedicated hardware interface panel, no dedicated interface, or a 
more highly structured (and therefore less user conﬁ gurable) electronic interface.
• PLCs have limited options for dealing with alarm matters.

• PLCs have limited ability to dynamically link information databases to operational 
displays.
• PLC-controlled older plants can have far fewer conﬁ gured alarms.
• PLC-controlled plants have a signiﬁ cant number of pieces of equipment that are 
not used during portions of the manufacturing cycle.
• PLCs usually control operations that often produce different products at closely 
spaced but different times.
For a DCS, the ﬁ rst statistics that announce alarm performance problems are the 
large number of conﬁ gured alarms, the high rate of alarm activations, and the dearth 
of useful information and guidance. It isn’t uncommon to ﬁ nd several thousand alarms 
conﬁ gured for each operator station.
For PLCs, the alarm performance problems are usually solved by ensuring that 
alarms are relevant to the current stage of manufacturing operations and that they pro-
vide useful operator support information and guidance. It is not at all unusual to ﬁ nd 
only a few hundred or less alarms conﬁ gured for an operator area. Moreover, these pro-
cesses very often involve portions of a plant that are used at different times (and so parts 
are shut down) or used in signiﬁ cantly different operating modes.
PLC Special Considerations
Most of the important beneﬁ ts from enhanced alarm control will come from the ability 
to eliminate alarms from equipment that is not currently being used for production and 
spared equipment. Another beneﬁ t will come from the ability to tailor alarm conﬁ gura-
tions to the current production states. Thus, the key logic portions of interest will be 
out-of-service plant and operating mode.
In order to facilitate these logical judgments, it is very important that the alarm 
control/management engine be able to determine exactly where the plant is and exactly 
what equipment is part of the current campaign and which is not.
1.13 CONTINUOUS VERSUS DISCRETE AND BATCH
Alarm management came into the forefront because of the serious problems we saw in 
the continuous manufacturing industries. Many of the examples are taken from those 
applications. However, the methodology and technology is equally applicable to discrete 
manufacturing and batch production. The foundations are identical. The approaches are 
the same. Yet the practitioners in the discrete and batch industries are quick to say that 
their problems are different. Yes, the problems are different. But alarms are still used 
for the same reason. Operator overload is the same. The basic differences are illustrated 
in appendix 10. Please refer there for a detailed comparison between the manufacturing 
modalities.
Chapter 1: Meet Alarm Management
   23
Generally, the batch process industries will be spending more time deﬁ ning the oper-
ating regimes and different situations under which the same or similar alarms are active 
and how the operator responses might differ for the same alarm due to the plant being in 
different operating situations. Also, there might be a different methodology for notify-
ing operators of alarm activations, since they often are away from PCS operating screens 
during production runs.
1.14 APPLICATION EFFECT ON ALARM DESIGN
There is no form of manufacturing operation that cannot beneﬁ t from an effective alarm 
system. Chemical plants, petrochemical plants, breweries, bakeries, food processors, 
pulp and paper operations, power and distribution plants, pharmaceutical plants, met-
als and mining operations, upstream petroleum, and others too diverse to list here, all 
experience abnormal operation to the extent that the operator requires proper notiﬁ ca-
tion. Even to the inexperienced eye, most of these plants differ from others greatly. It 
is natural to ask how applicable all of this alarm management technology is to these 
broad classes of manufacturing. Do the different industrial segments have differences 
that affect how their alarm systems are designed? The answer is yes, but not strongly.
Current alarm design is sufﬁ ciently rich to be fully applicable to industry across the 
board. The fundamental concepts are valid. The process is viable. The end results are 
effective. But, the alarm systems are different. They are responsive to different needs. 
They utilize different hardware and software and they look different. Space and energy 
do not permit this book to approach a full discussion of the detailed differences between 
the many forms of application. Therefore, a decision was reached to target the general 
forms of petrochemical, power, and related manufacturing.
A brief discussion of how alarm system design would be responsive to differing 
manufacturing forms can be useful to illustrate how universal this technology can be. 
Consider how the alarm system might be designed to handle shutdown events. We 
examine a traditional chemical plant operation and contrast it with a remote offshore 
crude oil production platform.
Onshore plants are generally designed to take advantage of adequate space between 
dangerous parts of the plant and to provide multiple escape routes for personnel and 
multiple access routes for emergency preparedness and response activities to commence. 
Offshore platforms cannot be. Offshore, both the close proximity of equipment and per-
sonnel and the almost complete isolation from escape and rescue combine to require 
a more conservative design of conditions that prompt shutdown and a more strin-
gent requirement for a proper shutdown. The operator has signiﬁ cantly different duty 
between onshore and offshore, and the alarm system design must be responsive to that 
need. Nonetheless, the alarm design principles and execution are quite similar for both.

1.15 TIME AND DYNAMICS
By now you are becoming familiar with the idea that alarm management is about pro-
duction events where either something has gone wrong, the operator isn’t really sure 
whether something has gone wrong, or things are OK. It turns out that both process 
dynamics and time are going to be very important to the fabric of successful alarm 
design. Let’s take a look at the general time-dynamics situation. We will do this using a

ﬁ ctional plant and a hypothetical form of view into the nature of that plant. The view is 
shown in Figure 1.15.1.
Figure 1.15.1. Magical viewer stage
In the ﬁ gure we see a horizontal time line with the passage of time depicted as move-
ment to the right. There is a label for “normal” at the left end of the time line. “More normal” 
which means that our magical viewer is telling us that the process is moving in a direction to 
be more normal, is below the time line. “Abnormal,” meaning our process is moving in the 
direction of becoming more abnormal, is above the time line. Let’s look into our “actual” 
ﬁ ctional process timeline shown in Figure 1.15.2. There are eight segments in the response.
 
Normal 
 We start out with the process just a bit in the normal region (segment 
label NORMAL). For a while, the process moves into the abnormal 
region and then back into the normal region.
 
Abnormal 
This segment (ABNORMAL—NO ALARMS) picks up from the
 
(no alarms) 
 NORMAL segment and moves deeper into the normal region be-
fore heading into the abnormal region. We are abnormal, but notice 
there are no alarms due to the process being in this state!
 
Abnormal 
Time progresses. This segment (ABNORMAL—ALARMS) sees
 
(alarms) 
 alarms activate. At this point, the operator has received notice of a 
problem. The process continues to become more abnormal.

Cause 
In this segment, the operator identifies the causes of the alarms.
 
identified 
 That is, the operator is now aware of what (is believed to be) the 
cause(s) of the abnormality. The process continues to move deeper 
into the abnormal region.
 
Solution 
Time continues to progress while the operator decides what to do
 
decided 
 to remedy the problem(s). He decides here. But the process contin-
ues deeper into the abnormal region. Why?
 
 
 (A decision by the operator is not anything that can be “felt” by the 
process. The process must wait for the action.)
 
Solution 
Here the operator implements the remedial plan. Changes have
 
implemented  been made, yet the process continues to deteriorate. Why?
 
 
 (An action is only a starting point. The process has dynamics or 
inertia. It will change in response to changes by the operator, 
but only in directions and with speeds that are inherent to its 
fundamental makeup and in some proportion to the magnitude of 
operator change.)
 
Plant 
Next, finally, the plant responds—yet that response moves it
 
responds 
 deeper into the abnormal region before eventually and rapidly 
returning to nearly normal.
Figure 1.15.2. Looking into our process
Chapter 1: Meet Alarm Management
   27
What does this little ﬁ ctional account tell us? First of all, it illustrates that it is possible for 
plants to become abnormal without producing alarm activations. Next, everything takes 
time. It takes time to discover the problem, understand it, decide what to do to correct 
it, and implement it, as well as for the plant itself to respond. Therefore, alarm redesign 
must take into account that plants can only respond in a limited way and that response 
will take time. Both the ways it can respond and the time it will take are basic and inher-
ent to each particular process.
1.16 HISTORICAL INCIDENTS
The inadequate performance of PCS alarm systems has become a signiﬁ cant cause of 
industrial incidents and serious accidents. Often either process plant operators are kept 
unaware of abnormal conditions due to the failure of appropriate alarms to activate 
or they did not activate with sufﬁ cient time to permit the operator to react effectively. 
We also see the “blinding” of operators by the tremendous avalanche of alarms during 
upsets. This effectively prevents the operator from identifying which alarms are impor-
tant and which are not. In both cases, the very tool that was supposed to warn and 
guide the operator during an abnormal situation not only failed to do either but created 
a distraction and additional stress. Eventually, this interference leads to escalation of 
seriousness by causing what started out as a minor manageable upset to produce major 
accidents, some progressing to serious disasters.
Three Mile Island
At about 4 a.m. on Wednesday, March 28, 1979, a series of failures and operational 
missteps occurred that resulted in the release of a small but measurable amount of radio-
active material into the air. While this incident did not lead to serious physical loss, the 
enormous political reaction would curtail all building of nuclear power reactors in the 
United States for the next four decades.
Interestingly, the speciﬁ c alarm management issues relating to this incident presaged 
most of the modern approach to alarm management today.
• Alarms are not applied properly due to a misunderstanding of the purpose of alarms 
and a failure to appreciate the scale of using them without careful consideration.
• The use of alarms is not sufﬁ ciently well understood. One must measure relevant 
data, infer performance (metrics), know what to do in the event of alarm activation, 
and know how to build alarms.
• Alarm design reaches deep into the existing infrastructure: alarms must be coordi-
nated with plant design and culture.
• Alarm systems can really work—they were ineffectual here, but a good design could 
have made a meaningful difference.
Alarm Management for Process Control
28    
• Alarm redesign is not simply an add-on—appropriate lead time is needed to arrive 
at a new working alarm system.
Milford Haven
In the early hours of the morning of 24 July 1994, at a Texaco reﬁ nery in Mil-
ford Haven, England, lightning struck the unit causing problems with the vac-
uum unit, the alkylation unit, the Butamer, and the FCC. Immediately after the 
strike, a number of units shutdown due to lack of utility power. A production 
control valve closed (we think moved to its failure position) and a unit started 
to ﬁ ll with liquid hydrocarbon. That control valve showed an erroneous state of 
being “open” on a process display graphic.
In response to the hydrocarbon build up, and as designed for safety protec-
tion of the vessel, the overpressure relief valve “popped” three times. The escap-
ing liquid entered the relief system eventually ending up in the knockout drum. 
The knockout drum eventually overﬁ lled (in part due to an earlier modiﬁ cation 
that had not been properly assessed at the design time, nor appreciated dur-
ing the upset). The overﬁ lled knockout drum then spilled liquid into a relief 
line that was not designed to contain such a ﬂ ow. The resultant failure released 
about 20 metric tons of hydrocarbon into the operating plant. The vapor cloud 
produced by this release eventually ignited about 110 meters away from the 
rupture, causing a major explosion equivalent to 4 metric tons of high explosive. 
The explosion caused $80 million damage and injured 26 people (thankfully, 
none seriously).6
There was an investigation. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) identiﬁ ed a 
number of contributing factors to the reﬁ nery’s inability to recognize and contain the 
abnormal operation. They are summarized in Table 1.16.1.
Speciﬁ cally, paragraph 69 of the HSE Report states, “Warnings of the developing 
problem were lost in the plethora of instrument alarms triggered in the control room, 
many of which were unnecessary and registering with increasing frequency, so operators 
were unable to appreciate what was actually happening.”
HSE’s speciﬁ c recommendations directly point to the necessity to provide tools and 
technology so that the production operator is able to detect abnormal process condi-
tions in a way that clearly extends beyond monitoring individual values of variables and 
their alarms. Moreover, we see here, perhaps many of us for the ﬁ rst time, the addition 
of another important element to the operating equation: the expectation that operators 
be able to manage the sometimes charged issue of continuing to operate versus initi-
ating controlled shutdowns. The implied expectation of this particular item suggests 
that plants clearly visit, decide, plan for, and train for situations where operators will be 
expected to manage the explicit issue of continuing to operate or not. Additional HSE 
targeted items appear as numbered items below. The reference numbers refer to speciﬁ c 
numbered items in the formal report.

 #3 Display systems should be conﬁ gured to provide an overview of the condition of 
the process including, where appropriate, mass and volumetric balance summaries.

checks whenever level or ﬂ ow problems are experienced within a unit.

alarms; alarms are limited to a number that an operator can effectively monitor;

system alarm.
Texas City
At ﬁ ve minutes after three on the morning of 23 March, 2005 [at the BP reﬁ n-
ery in Texas City, Texas], a high-level sensor alarm went off indicating rising 
levels of ﬂ ammable hydrocarbons in a distillation tower, but a redundant alarm

never went off on the day of the accident, the investigator said. The [investigat-
ing] board estimated that liquid inside the tower ultimately reached a point of 
120 feet or more. The tower normally operated with less than 10 feet of liquid 
at the bottom.7
The incident involved the rafﬁ nate splitter (a distillation column that separates gas-
oline-blending components) and the blowdown drum and stack (F-20), designed to 
handle pressure relief and vent streams. The investigation concluded that the explosions 
were most likely the result of ignition of hydrocarbon vapors released from the F-20. 
These hydrocarbons were discharged when the pressure in the splitter column increased 
rapidly and exceed the set pressure of the overhead line relief valves. The F-20 was 
unable to handle all of the ﬂ uids, vapors, and liquid discharged from the top of the stack. 
An unknown ignition source from the numerous potential ones present in the uncon-
trolled area (vehicles, trailers, etc.) ignited the resulting vapor cloud.8
The [incident] resulted in 15 deaths, about 170 injuries, and signiﬁ cant eco-
nomic losses, and was one of the most serious U.S. workplace disasters of the 
past two decades. Key alarms and a level transmitter failed to operate properly 
and to warn operators of unsafe and abnormal conditions within the tower and 
the blowdown drum.9
Federal investigators say managers authorized the start-up of a unit in March 
despite knowing key alarms weren’t working. That start-up killed 15 people.10
According to an Associated Press article, “The Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration agency also is considering whether to refer some violations to the Justice 
Department for possible criminal prosecution, said John Miles, Jr., regional administra-
tor for OSHA.”11
Of a total of $20,720,000 in ﬁ nes levied against BP, the instrumentation and alarm 
system portion alone was $2,170,000. We are led undeniably to value the importance of 
the instrumentation and control systems for safe process operations and the critical role 
played by the alarm system.
Why Now?
It must be clear to the reader at this point that the alarm system has two important func-
tional requirements. First, it must detect and warn the operator of abnormal operating 
conditions that require attention. Second, it must not mislead, overload, or distract the 
operator while meeting the ﬁ rst requirement. As the above incidents tell and, unfortu-
nately, similar ones reinforce, this situation seems to be getting worse. Why are we get-
ting more alarms now than ever before? The answer points to an interesting illustration 
taken from nature: an iceberg (Figure 1.16.1). An iceberg ﬂ oats with a bit less than 10% 
showing above water and the remaining 90-plus percentage hidden below. We see alarm 
Chapter 1: Meet Alarm Management
   31
problems “above the waterline.” 
We do not see most of what 
really causes them “below the 
waterline.”
There are a number of sug-
gestive industry trends that 
bear on the causes below the 
waterline. The affected indus-
tries have been mostly mature 
ones. Their products tend to 
be commodities. Over the past 
two decades, there have been 
serious economic pressures in 
these segments. The response of 
the enterprise managers was to 
cut costs, try to force operating 
responsiveness to more closely 
follow 
fast-changing 
market 
pressures, and adopt the expec-
tation that new investments 
would rarely be forthcoming. 
This in turn led to the reduc-
tion of engineering and other 
support staff and the outsourc-
ing of an increasing portion of 
what little technology appli-
cations remained. The causal 
chain leads to plants having individuals with much less experience in both design and 
maintenance. The ultimate effects of all of this, eventually and proximately, wind up in 
decreased process reliability. Decreases in reliability show up as increases in abnormal 
operations. Abnormal operations are usually announced ﬁ rst by alarms. Hence, we see 
more and more challenges to the alarm system, just at a time that we have come to learn 
that the “tried and true” design is itself inadequate! We see (ﬁ g. 1.16.1) larger numbers 
of alarms (ice above the waterline). But those alarms are very often the result of underly-
ing deﬁ ciencies (ice hidden below).
1.17 THE NEW DESIGN
Not by Subtraction Alone
It will be very helpful for us to recognize that alarm management problems will not be, 
nor are most problems generally, solved by subtraction alone. That is, we should not 
expect to improve the alarm system simply by deciding which of the already conﬁ gured 
Figure 1.16.1. The iceberg of alarm management

32    
alarms must be removed. Many of those old alarms had been conﬁ gured to assist the 
operator in some way. Unfortunately, those alarms did not deliver the expected aid. 
There are new alarms that need adding. Therefore, other, more effective means must be 
sought to ﬁ ll in that void. Redesign is a package deal. It will change the look and feel 
of many of the operator’s tools. It ﬁ rst requires the establishment of a philosophy with 
a set of clear alarm system design objectives and operating parameters. This philosophy 
includes speciﬁ c guidelines and practices for the new alarm design. It also will visit what, 
if any, important tools will be added to provide operator assistance to manage situations 
that were, in error, assigned to the alarm system alone. Permission to operate and the 
situation awareness tools are examples.
Starting Alarm Improvement
Data gathering and analysis are used to provide a clearer understanding of existing deﬁ -
ciencies. Baseline performance metrics are calculated and used to speciﬁ cally understand 
exactly what the current alarm system is doing. Later on, we will use these same measures 
to evaluate the new design behavior. Alarm conventions are established to determine the 
minimal required alarm conﬁ guration for the plant. Rules for priority and alarm activa-
tion points are established. Each alarm is fully documented, which, incidentally, results 
in a very good training and diagnostic tool for operators. Other advanced techniques are 
developed to help control alarm ﬂ ooding as well as to ensure that extraneous alarms are 
reduced. Graphics are evaluated and improved to provide operators with the ability to 
understand the degree of normal of their plant operation.
Alarm Philosophy
All enterprises have goals for their operation and recognized limitations as to what they 
can accomplish. The alarm philosophy will recognize both and incorporate them into 
the alarm improvement process. In the alarm philosophy, alarms are deﬁ ned, appropriate 
operator responses are identiﬁ ed, success criteria are established, and the roles that all 
other parts of the enterprise should provide to support the alarm system redesign and 
subsequent operation are explained. This is where the complete design is framed. Think 
of the philosophy as really meaning “fully expanded design speciﬁ cation” sufﬁ cient to 
provide the alarm improvement teams with the clear guidance necessary to produce the 
new alarm design.
Data Gathering and Analysis
No problem is understood until its true magnitude is known. Much of our informa-
tion up until now is anecdotal and subjective. Hard data will be needed for the plant 
to understand the problems and generate the redesign activities to make the extensive 
modiﬁ cations and improvements necessary to provide the proper operator support. Yet it 
Chapter 1: Meet Alarm Management
   33
is the very nature of the problem that makes the capture and analysis of the data hard to 
do. The amount of data is extensive. For example, it is not unusual in any given 24-hour 
operating period for a typical plant (one board operator’s area) to produce 1000 to 2000 
entries in activity logs. These logs normally include alarm activations, alarm acknowledg-
ments, alarm clearings, operator actions, and system status events. Three months of data 
are usually used. This normally means from 125,000 to 250,000 entries.
Let’s look at some typical data. Figure 1.17.1 shows the frequency of occurrence 
of the top eleven alarm events over a period of 30 days. It has been sorted from highest 
to lowest. For example, the highest event, an off-normal alarm, occurred nearly 20,000 
times. The eleventh highest event, also an off-normal alarm, occurred over 2000 times. 
Just considering the top eleven events, the operators of this area had to face an alarm about 
every 30 seconds, hour in and hour out. We will see in a later metrics portion of this book 
that this rate far exceeds any operator’s ability to manage. And just as clearly, we conclude 
that either such frequent interruption will severely stress the operator or, what usually hap-
pens, alarm events will be relegated to background noise and largely ignored.
During upset conditions, alarms can activate so quickly that they actually appear to 
ﬂ ood the system, hence the term alarm flood. Figure 1.17.2 depicts how a typical alarm 
ﬂ ood might look. In our example, during a 5-minute period at the onset of ﬂ ood, as 
many as 900 alarm events occur. Interestingly, alarm ﬂ oods actually are deﬁ ned to begin 
Figure 1.17.1. Number of alarm occurrences within last 30 days (by frequency)
Alarm Management for Process Control
34    
with ten or more alarms in a 10-minute time period. The ﬁ gure shows typical alarm 
activation rates during an “alarm ﬂ ood” situation to be 70 to 180 per minute (350 to 
900 per 5-minute period). This calculates to be between one and three alarm activations 
per second. This is far beyond anyone’s ability to even read, much less understand and 
respond to.
Figure 1.17.3 illustrates the effects of the lack of uniform standards for setting of 
alarm priority. This ﬁ gure differs from the earlier two in that it shows data from the PCS 
conﬁ guration. The bars do not represent activations, though it is likely that there will be 
some relationship. Note also that the ratio of low-priority to emergency-priority alarms 
is somewhat out of balance (it should be closer to ten or more to one, as opposed to 
two to one, as shown). However, the most startling discovery is the very large number 
of high-priority alarms in proportion to low-priority. We expect a ratio of four to ﬁ ve 
low-priority alarms to each high-priority alarm. In the case shown, the high priority is 
actually over two-and-a-half times more than the low priority.
Figure 1.17.4 demonstrates a clear lack of correlation between alarm activations and 
operator actions. Recall our fundamental deﬁ nition of an alarm: ALARM ACTIVATION = 
OPERATOR ACTION. In this example, the alarm activations are a factor of 25% to 400% 
greater than operator actions. A good design has them about equal. It can be estimated 
Figure 1.17.2. Example of an alarm ﬂ ood

   35

36    
that actions occurred for only about 30% of the alarms. A conservative estimate would 
conclude that the alarms could be pared down to less than one third. The alarm sys-
tem should not substitute for operator vigilance. Alarms are not “wake-up” calls. Useless 
alarms serve no purpose.
• Any alarm activation that occurs for which the operator has no understanding of 
what action is called for is a useless alarm.
• Any alarm activation that occurs for which the operator knows the action but can-
not implement it is again a useless alarm.
• Any alarm activation that occurs for which the operator knows the action and imple-
ments it but cannot determine whether the action has been effective is a useless alarm.
• Alarm activations that occur too quickly for all to be either acted on or understood 
are useless. (The alarm system itself has been identiﬁ ed as a prime cause of an 
operational upset for many of these cases.)
Now that we have had a chance to look at typical data, we are in a better position to 
understand the importance of the basics of effective alarm management. A key beneﬁ t 
derived from the alarm performance data is the identiﬁ cation of “bad actors.” Quite 
often, a relatively small percentage of conﬁ gured alarms will be responsible for a large 
percentage of the actual alarm activations. Refer again to Figure 1.17.1. Looking at the 
ﬁ rst tag (the one at the top in the rank-ordered list), activations occur about ten times 
the activation rates of the last two tags in the list. To place these ﬁ rst eleven in perspec-
tive, the median number of all activations for the month is approximately 1/10,000th 
of the highest one. This exponential form of falloff is typical. To eliminate bad actors, 
focus on the underlying issues that led to the alarms: wrong point to alarm, incorrect 
alarm limit, unresolved process or instrumentation problem, inconsistent alarm activa-
tion parameters (lockup, etc.), and more. But, as troublesome as they are, bad actors 
are only part of our problem. Simply ﬁ xing them all will not resolve your basic alarm 
management limitations. Redesign is in order.
Your data can be instrumental in assisting the improvement teams to develop a 
proper and useful alarm philosophy. A good philosophy is the blueprint for a good 
design. Once the nature of the problem is better understood, it aids the process of focus-
ing on the major contributing aspects to the problem. Understanding the data requires 
tools. Chapter 4 discusses the major providers and their products.
Alarm Conventions and Redesign Guidelines
A useful measure you will use to evaluate the design of your alarm system will be to com-
pare your site’s data against established norms for the industry. There are two categories 
of data: static and dynamic. Static data are the data contained in the PCS conﬁ guration 
that speciﬁ es what is alarmed and how. This type of data is also referred to as configured 
alarm data. Dynamic data are the data contained in alarm activation logs. Each time 
an alarm occurs, it is called an alarm activation. A single conﬁ gured alarm can activate 
Chapter 1: Meet Alarm Management
   37
many times (it will generally do so every time the process variable crosses over the alarm 
limit). Many conﬁ gured alarms never activate. Clearly, there is a link between conﬁ gured 
alarms and alarm activations. However, the link is rather indirect, though the more that 
are conﬁ gured, the more will likely activate. As we have seen, this is especially true dur-
ing upset situations.
The list of static alarm metrics includes the following:
• Number of alarms conﬁ gured; the priority spread of conﬁ gured alarms
• Number of alarms conﬁ gured per control loop
• Number of alarms conﬁ gured per analog measurement (not part of a control loop)
• Number of alarms conﬁ gured per digital measurement
The list of dynamic alarm metrics includes the following:
• Short-term rates of activations
• Long-term rate of activations
• Priority spread of activations
• Time for the operator to acknowledge alarms
• Time for the alarm to return to normal
• Rate of activations during alarm ﬂ oods; number of stale (or standing) alarms
• Ratio of alarm activations to operator actions
The alarm system is redesigned to bring the plant’s data closer to industry stan-
dards for the related applications. Alarm system redesign involves a complete review of 
all alarms. It uses the alarm philosophy to enable system designers to set standards and 
implementation criteria to design a properly functioning system. Most major aspects 
of the enterprise will be examined. They include operating procedures and practices, 
control graphics, training, and maintenance. The process of redesign (alarm rationaliza-
tion) relies on a hierarchy of specialized procedures. In the ﬁ nal analysis, it is really quite 
straightforward:
 
1. Eliminate all redundant alarm points or start from no conﬁ gured alarms and con-
ﬁ gure only the minimum needed alarms.
 
2. Determine the alarm activation point(s).
 
3. Determine the correct priority for each alarm.
 
4. Develop a plan to handle each alarm—what it means, how to recognize its symp-
toms, and what to do to remedy the problem announced by the alarm activation.
 
5. Design the strategy to handle alarm ﬂ ood.
 
6. Design an enhanced ability of the operator to detect early malfunctions of the plant.

7. Design the implementation plan.
 
8. Document all changes (manuals, graphics, management of change, training, etc.).
 
9. Work out the process for keeping the design effective down the road.
Using the above process, you will ﬁ nd either the number of points in the new alarm 
system is modestly less than it was originally or they are substantially less. It all depends 
on how carefully the alarm philosophy was developed and how dedicated its application 
was to the alarm improvement process. If the results achieved do not appear to be suf-
ﬁ cient, the process is repeated, with more attention to truly understanding the essential 
need for each alarm.
1.18 EXAMPLE ALARM REDESIGN (RATIONALIZATION) RESULTS
One of the more surprising realizations to relative newcomers to alarm management is 
how many alarms are eliminated or modiﬁ ed by a proper rationalization. In the begin-
ning, they are prepared to ﬁ nd from a quarter to a half of the original alarms eliminated. 
In fact, the expected reduction is more like 75% or 80%. At this point, the reader must be 
coming face-to-face with the realization that there is more to alarm improvement than 
a bit of handy engineering.
As an example, and to illustrate the process and results to themselves, a chemical plant 
developed a test site case for alarm improvement. This particular test was a small part of a 
single-operator area. They start out with a total of 154 conﬁ gured alarms. What follows 
is a line-by-line explanation of where the alarm system was modiﬁ ed. Please take care 
to note that while each line item is correct, many of the categories overlap. Therefore, 
simple mathematically sums will be misleading.
Start with 154 conﬁ gured alarms.
• 62 (of the 154) were deleted outright. They were unnecessary.
• 59 (of the remaining 92) had documentation errors that were corrected.
• 52 (45 from the 92 remaining; 7 from the 62 deleted) changed to alerts (an alert is a 
message to the operator that does not use the alarm system to deliver; see chapter 12).
• 50 (of the 47 remaining, some more than one each) had conﬁ guration corrections 
(some aspect of the point needed to be changed to conform to the original engi-
neering design requirements; changes included priority and alarm setting below).
• 26 (of the 47 remaining) had their priority changed.
• 19 (of the 47 remaining) were reduced to 7 alarms.
• 7 (of the 35 remaining) were reduced to a single alert.
• 3 (of the 28 remaining) had the alarm settings changed.
• 2 new alarms were added (making a total of 30 alarms).
Chapter 1: Meet Alarm Management
   39
• 1 new alert was added.
• 14 (of the 30 alarms) were “toggled” on or off based on plant state.
RESULTS:
• 30 conﬁ gured alarms
• 53 alerts (52 initially, which counts the ones reduced to an alert, plus the added alert)
This is an 80% reduction in alarms. They were able to gain this impressive improve-
ment only by going back to basics. Tinkering just prolongs the process. Success is 
attained by understanding the real purpose of alarms and seeking fundamentals by which 
to approach a redesign. Applying the new knowledge and using good engineering prac-
tices can attain truly impressive results.
1.19 COMPLETING THE DESIGN
It has often been recognized that good alarming practices can be achieved only after the 
production plant process itself is better understood. As a result, not only is the plant on 
the way to an improved operational tool (the alarm system), but the operators better 
understand what they are doing and how best to do it. It is a nice synergy.
There is more to be gained if you are to realize the full potential of your redesigned 
alarm system. The remaining topics provide the ingredients for task completion.
Advanced Techniques
Up until this point, all of our focus and discussion about alarms has been about alarm 
points individually. We decide whether or not to alarm the point. If we alarm it, we 
assign activation points and priority. Then we decide what to do about the alarm. But the 
alarm points individually are only part of the story. Just as the plant is interrelated and 
interconnected, so are the alarm points for the plant. We now take into understanding 
these interrelationships. Using advanced techniques (discussed later), you will eliminate 
alarms for equipment that is not operating at the time. You will also manage alarms that 
can occur individually but often occur together. There are various means to do this. 
Most employ some logic to detect operating states of equipment or alarm status of other 
alarm points.
Situation Awareness
About now careful readers are about to reach a conclusion:
Now that I’ve carefully done all that was needed to redesign my alarm system, I 
feel that I have ended up with many fewer alarms than I thought I needed to run 
Alarm Management for Process Control
40    
my plant. How am I supposed to ﬁ nd out what is really happening deep inside 
it? How will I know that something might be wrong? What do I need to know 
to tell the operator when anything does go wrong?
If alarm system design were as far as it goes, the answer would have to be, “You’d 
just have to take your chances with fate.” Fortunately, this isn’t as far as things go. Our 
next step will be to improve the operators’ ability to watch the process and understand 
how it is actually performing, which is, after all, one of the key reasons why the alarm 
system is there and why it somehow grew into that awful monster that caused most of 
the alarm management problems we needed to ﬁ x. This ability to understand the operat-
ing condition of the plant is called situation awareness. To acquire situation awareness we 
provide the operator with tools for early detection of operational problems. Such tools 
include sensor validation, valve monitoring, control loop integrity monitoring, and process 
condition monitoring (tower ﬂ ood, reaction runaway, compressor surge, etc.). These tools 
provide a signiﬁ cant beneﬁ t over the old way of hoping that either the operator can spot 
the problem or, if he does not, the alarm system will detect it for him in enough time 
for disaster to be avoided. There are a growing number of techniques and commercial 
tools now in the marketplace to assist situation awareness and thus improve production.
Operator Screen Design
Key to better plant performance is the operator’s ability to see what’s going on in the 
process. Graphic control screens are the primary means to do that seeing. When the 
screens do not guide the operator, when the information is too hard to ﬁ nd, when the 
information is confusing, or when the information is not there, the operator will not 
be able to manage as well as required. The current best practices in operator graph-
ics involve a hierarchical structure of displays, clear navigation between displays, and 
a straightforward causal organization of information on each display (limits on use of 
color, control of ﬂ ashing items, and exploitation of icons over text and ﬁ gures, to name 
a few). Chapter 12 contains complete coverage of this material.
Operational Integrity Improvement
Anyone who spends time looking over the shoulder of a production plant operator will 
quickly realize what an enormous task it is to watch the many hundreds of variables, keep 
track of how they interact, and detect developing problems. Most try. Very, very few are 
able to do it well. The new approach relies on some very solid, traditional engineering:
 
1. Design and build the physical plant for operability
 
2. Develop and implement comprehensive procedures for operation and maintenance
 
3. Train extensively
 
4. Keep things maintained
Chapter 1: Meet Alarm Management
   41
 
5. Monitor performance
 
6. Feed results back and make improvements
Condition Monitoring
As important as they are, the items above are not sufﬁ cient to do the job. Consequently, 
there are a number of specialized tools to assist the operator. They range all the way 
from sophisticated mathematical techniques to pragmatic algorithms. An abbreviated list 
includes the following:
 
1. Controller tuning monitors
 
2. Controller mode tracking and utilization monitors
 
3. Extensive mass and energy balances
 
4. Sensor validation
 
5. Unit operation integrity monitors
 
6. Multivariate statistical analysis (multivariable state estimation)
 
7. Advanced controls
 
8. Adaptive controls
1.20 ALARM IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS
We have recognized the need and have the desire to improve our alarm system. Here are 
the key steps in the process.
Phase I: Problem Awareness and Solution Framework
 
• Assess the current alarm situation. Assemble the data-gathering tool kit, gather 
alarm performance statistics, identify upset histories, and assess equipment main-
tenance relationships with operational integrity and alarm performance.
 
• Develop an alarm management philosophy. Make the effort plantwide, include rel-
evant enterprise goals, and provide guidance and speciﬁ cations for alarm redesign.
Phase II: Alarm Redesign
 
• Do housekeeping. Fix all of the other problems in the facility that have been engi-
neered and installed and should be working but are not.
 
• Perform alarm rationalization. Conduct actual redesign of alarm system includ-
ing conﬁ guration and graphics.
 
• Incorporate enhanced alarming techniques. Design any enhanced alarm capabili-
ties needed for managing alarm ﬂ ood and so on.
Alarm Management for Process Control
42    
Phase III: Implementation
 
• Reconfigure PCS for new alarm system design. Install new conﬁ guration changes 
(including parameters and priority modiﬁ cations) and graphics.
 
• Modify operating procedures to align with new alarm design.
 
• Modify training to align with new alarm design.
 
• Complete a management of change.
Phase IV: Continuous Beneﬁ t
 
• Perform periodic follow-up alarm performance studies.
 
• Investigate alarm floods and process upsets.
1.21 LESSONS FOR SUCCESSFUL ALARM MANAGEMENT
As you have come to expect, this book is going to reach straight for the problem of 
what’s wrong and then march directly onto the path of a successful resolution to get it 
right. To do this well, you will need the eyes of a military lookout to see the real prob-
lems, the wisdom of a seer to get to the heart of the matter, the strategy and planning of 
a general to get it done, and the heart of a healer to keep the heady success vision from 
overcoming the needed reality to get it done with style and respect.
Lesson 1—THEORY
 
• Beautiful theories are often destroyed by ugly facts. Improving the alarm system 
alone will not improve the control room.
Lesson 2—PROGRESS
 
• Real progress often requires a change in direction. It is time to end the “blame the 
operator” approach to control room problems.
Lesson 3—HISTORY
 
• Do not forget about history. Incidents and accidents are powerful teachers but not 
the only ones.
Lesson 4—HUMILITY
 
• It is always wise to maintain some humility. Almost everything we think we know 
about alarms will change.
Lesson 5—TRUTH
 
• Technologists must always have a single agenda—the truth. Get good data, per-
form adequate analyses, and believe the results.
Chapter 1: Meet Alarm Management
   43
Lesson 6—EVIDENCE
 
• Incredible results require incredible evidence. Plants without a lot of alarms actu-
ally work better.
Lesson 7—FUNDING
 
• A good idea does not always attract funding. EEMUA, OSHA, ISA 18, and 
NAMUR all need a business case as well.
Lesson 8—PREPARE
 
• Be prepared to be unpopular and uncomfortable. Every activity in the plant will 
be touched by alarm improvement work.
1.22 IMPORTANT DESIGN AND SAFETY NOTICE
In addition to the broad and comprehensive approach to developing a working solution 
to the alarm management problem, an important strength of this book is the wealth 
of examples, alternatives, and suggestions for your consideration. All control schemes, 
design suggestions, displays, diagrams, tables, ﬁ gures, trend charts, and the like described 
and illustrated in this book refer to materials that have been designed to amplify and 
explain concepts and practices used for alarm management understanding. They are 
provided for training and understanding purposes only and are not intended for imple-
mentation. The choice of which aspects to alarm for the plant or process, the parameters 
of that alarm, the proper operator response to correct the alarm condition, and all other 
details of that alarm must be retained wholly by qualiﬁ ed, authorized members of the 
plant staff, who must act with full knowledge of their speciﬁ c plant conﬁ guration, pro-
cess conditions, equipment, and applicable statutory practices and requirements.
No single work is capable of conveying the entire collective experience and impor-
tant nuances necessary for success. After reading this book, it is recommended that 
plants with intentions or plans for alarm improvement seek additional speciﬁ c guidance 
and experience from knowledgeable experts.
1.23 CONCLUSION
Alarm management problems announce themselves. There are always alarms on the 
screen. Alarms occur too often or too quickly when things go wrong. When lots of 
alarms do activate, it is rarely clear what to do about them. Sometimes, the very alarm 
system itself contributes to poor upset response.
Successful alarm management works because it points the way to signiﬁ cant plant 
improvements. Not only are the alarm activations less frequent but they are more meaningful 
when they do occur. And quite apart from individual alarms, the redesign process points out 
the need for operator support tools to identify early process problems and to better convey 
the plant information through the graphics. Alarm management is truly a synergistic activity!
