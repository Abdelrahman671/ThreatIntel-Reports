Over the past few weeks we have been analyzing this malware family, which we have dubbed \u2018FindPOS\u2019 due to strings consistently found in each variant.\r\n\r\nWhile this malware doesn\u2019t show strong sophistication, the large number of variants shows prevalence similar to families such as Alina and Backoff. It is clear that FindPOS should be considered a strong threat to Microsoft Windows POS vendors, and measures should be taken to ensure protection.\r\nWorkflow\r\nThe malware in question has the ability to scrape memory for track data, exfiltrate any discovered data via HTTP POST requests, and in some instances log keystrokes. While the malware family uses many common techniques witnessed in previous malware families targeting POS devices, the prevalence and continued development of this malware demonstrates a threat to those running Windows-based point of sale terminals.\r\n\r\nThe general workflow of the FindPOS malware family can be seen below.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvolution\r\nOver the course of our research, a total of nine variants of FindPOS have been discovered. Using compile timestamp information, we can see a timeline of these variants below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA breakdown of the specific functionality changes between versions is as follows:\r\n\r\nVersion 2.1\r\n\r\n \tModified hashing algorithm to use the following information:\r\n\r\n \tVolume Serial Number\r\n \tNetworking Adapters (IPv4 Only)\r\n\r\n\r\n \tAdded \u2018uinfo\u2019 POST parameter\r\n\r\nVersion 5.57\r\n\r\n \tAdded ability to terminate previously installed FindPOS upon installation\r\n \tCode cleanup during install\r\n \tSet main thread to lowest priority\r\n \tAdded memory scraping checks\r\n\r\n \tExpiration year between 2014 and 2030\r\n \tExpiration month between 1 and 12\r\n \tService code set to either \u2018101\u2019 or \u2018201\u2019\r\n\r\n\r\n \tAdded ability to download\/execute files\r\n \tRemoved \u2018Cookie: income=1\u2019 HTTP Header\r\n \tAdded User-Agent HTTP Header\r\n\r\nVersion 5.80\r\n\r\n \tModified memory scraping checks\r\n\r\n \tExpiration year cannot exceed 2030 (no lower bound check)\r\n \tExpiration month cannot exceed 12 (no lower bound check)\r\n\r\n\r\n \tCode enhancements to domain\/URI configuration\r\n\r\nVersion 5.90\r\n\r\n \tAdded keylogging functionality\r\n\r\nVersion 6.0\r\n\r\n \tNo significant changes identified\r\n\r\nVersion 6.02\r\n\r\n \tMinor modifications to exfiltration function\r\n\r\nVersion 6.03\r\n\r\n \tNo significant changes identified\r\n\r\nVersion 6.04\r\n\r\n \tMinor modifications to exfiltration sleep timer\r\n\r\nAs we can see from the above timeline, FindPOS appears to have been very actively developed early on, while over time the author made minimal changes. These minimal changes were likely made for performance reasons or potentially bug fixes.\r\nInstallation\r\nUpon execution, FindPOS will generate a lowercase alphabetic executable name of eight characters (example: abodeign.exe). This name is generated using the following system information:\r\n\r\n \tC:\\ Volume Serial Number\r\n \tSystemBiosdate\r\n \tVideoBiosdate\r\n \tCPU Identifier\r\n \tMicrosoft Windows ProductId\r\n\r\nUsing these values in order to generate results in a consistently generated name when run on the same machine. Please note that the hashing algorithm used was modified in version 2.1. Please refer to the \u2018Evolution\u2019 section above for details.\r\n\r\nThis executable name is then compared against the original executable name of the running malware. Should those names not match, the malware will proceed to continue with its installation routine.\r\n\r\nFindPOS proceeds to copy itself to the following directories using the executable name that was previously generated:\r\n\r\n \t%SystemRoot%\\System32\\[name].exe\r\n \t%USERPROFILE%\\[name].exe\r\n\r\nShould these file copy operations prove successful, the malware will write the following registry keys:\r\n\r\n \tHKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run [name] : %SystemRoot%\\System32\\[name].exe\r\n \tHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run [name] : %USERPROFILE%\\[name].exe\r\n\r\nThe malware will proceed to spawn a new instance of %SystemRoot%\\System32\\[name].exe via a call to CreateProcessA. Should this prove successful, the malware will execute the following command prior to exiting. This command is responsible for deleting the original executable.\r\ncmd.exe \/c del [original_executable_path] &gt;&gt; NUL\r\nShould the CreateProcessA call on %SystemRoot%\\System32\\[name].exe fail, FindPOS will attempt to spawn a new instance of %USERPROFILE%\\[name].exe. If this proves successful, FindPOS will attempt to delete the original executable using the same technique previously seen.\r\n\r\nAfter installation of FindPOS is successful, the malware will create a global mutex in order to ensure only one instance of FindPOS is running. This mutex has the following name:\r\n\r\n \tWIN_[hex]\r\n\r\nWhere [hex] is a series of 16 uppercase hexadecimal characters that are generated using the same technique witnessed when generating the malware\u2019s executable name during the installation routine.\r\n\r\nAfter this mutex is successfully created, FindPOS will continue to scrape memory and optionally log keystrokes.\r\nMemory Scraping\r\nMemory scraping is a technique found in the majority of POS malware families discovered in prior years. The concept is fairly simple: read the memory of running processes on a POS terminal, and look for track data. When a card is swiped on a POS terminal, and the transaction is processed, the card data will often reside in memory unencrypted for a brief period of time. Attackers exploit this weakness in order to find track data.\r\n\r\nA common technique for increasing performance of memory scrapers is to denylist a list of commonly seen process names, such as explorer.exe, lsass.exe, csrss.exe, etc. Alternatively, some malware families leverage an allowlist approach, where only specific process names are targeted. FindPOS, however, uses a brand new approach. This particular family determines the owner of every process on the system, via calls to EnumProcesses, OpenProcess, GetTokenInformation and LookupAccountSid. The owner of the process is then compared against the \u2018NT AUTHORITY\u2019 string. This filters out any processes not being run as system or as a service. In the example below, all processes except for \u2018dwm.exe\u2019 and the multiple instances of \u2018conhost.exe\u2019 would be filtered.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1.\u00a0Example Running Processes\r\nIn the event a process is not filtered, memory is scraped via calls to VirtualQueryEx and ReadProcessMemory. This is a very common approach that is witnessed in almost all memory scrapers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce the data is read, FindPOS proceeds to look for track data. Starting with version 5.57, the author began making checks based on various data found within the track data. For example, in version 5.57 the author began ignoring any track data that did not have an expiration date between January 2014 to December 2030. This helped to ensure expired card data was not captured.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the author paid close attention to the service codes that appeared within any discovered track data. The service code is a three-digit number that represents the type of card being swiped. In this particular instance, the author chose to only capture cards that held the following options:\r\n\r\nFirst Digit \u2013 \u2018International interexchange OK\u2019 or \u2018International interchange, use IC (chip) where feasible\u2019\r\n\r\nSecond Digit \u2013 \u2018Normal\u2019\r\n\r\nThird Digit \u2013 \u2018No restrictions\u2019\r\n\r\nBy adding these restrictions, the author was able to ignore cards that it did not consider to be appealing. Such cards included gift cards, debit cards, and test cards to name a few.\r\n\r\nAny discovered track data is stored in memory until exfiltration occurs. This data is exfiltrated via the \u2018data\u2019 POST parameter.\r\nKeylogging\r\nStarting in version 5.90, the author of FindPOS began adding keylogging to this family. Many magnetic card readers often will emulate a keyboard device. Knowing this, many POS malware authors incorporate this functionality into their families. In addition to collecting track data, keylogging also has the ability to potentially collect usernames, passwords, or other sensitive data on the victim machine.\r\n\r\nIn order to accomplish this, the author spawns a new thread that is responsible for keylogging. A common technique of creating a new empty window, registering itself as a raw input device, and making calls to the GetRawInputData API is used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAny keystrokes are stored in memory until exfiltration occurs. The keystrokes are exfiltrated via the \u2018logs\u2019 POST parameter.\r\nExfiltration\r\nExfiltration for FindPOS takes place via HTTP POST requests. A number of hardcoded domains are configured for each sample, often varying between FindPOS variants. HTTP POST requests are made every 120 seconds (2 minutes). In the event any data has been discovered, such as track data or keystroke data, this data is included. An example request from version 5.80 is shown below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we can see, a number of POST variables are included in each request:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn example of decoding the \u2018uinfo\u2019 parameter can be seen below:\r\n\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; import base64\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; base64.b64decode(\"Sk9TSC1QQyBAIGpvc2gtUENcam9zaA==\")\r\n'JOSH-PC @ josh-PC\\\\josh'\r\n\r\nKeystroke data and track data is obfuscated using a combination of Base64 encoding and a single-byte XOR encryption. Decoding this data can be seen below:\r\n\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; import base64\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; raw = \"\"\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; for s in base64.b64decode(\"HxkaGxgfGhodGhoaGhsTGxcbHxoSGxobGhMbGBkeHxwdEhMaGxU=\"):\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 raw += chr(ord(s) ^ 0x2a)\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print raw\r\n5301250070000191=15081010912345678901?\r\n\r\nIn addition to data exfiltration, FindPOS added the ability to download\/execute further malware. Upon sending an exfiltration request, should the server respond with a 0x1 or 0x4 byte, followed by a URL, this file will be downloaded and subsequently executed.\r\n\r\nThe file is downloaded to a temporary folder, with the file itself prefixed by \u2018BN\u2019. This downloaded file is executed via a call to CreateProcessA. In the event the file cannot be properly downloaded or executed, it is deleted from disk.\r\nDomain\/IP Address Information\r\nA total of 37 domains were discovered while researching the FindPOS malware family. Of these domains, 13 unique IP addresses were discovered. The geographic location of these IP addresses can be seen below. Please refer to the Appendix for a full list of all domains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe majority of the domains discovered were configured with the following WHOIS information.\r\n\r\nRegistrant Name: Julio Quinlan\r\nRegistrant Organization: NA\r\nRegistrant Street: 4516 Glory Road\r\nRegistrant City: Nashville\r\nRegistrant State\/Province: TN\r\nRegistrant Postal Code: 37204\r\nRegistrant Country: us\r\nRegistrant Phone: +01.9318135965\r\nRegistrant Phone Ext:\r\nRegistrant Fax: +01.9318135965\r\nRegistrant Fax Ext:\r\nRegistrant Email: barkmanueta@rambler.ru\r\n\r\nPlease note that the registrant email was slightly different depending on the domain queried. While the information above appears legitimate, it was discovered to be falsified.\r\nRelated Samples \u2013 Keylogging\/LogMeIn Recon\r\nDuring the course of our research, a number of similar samples were discovered. One such sample can be seen below.\r\n\r\nVersion 8.3 \u2013 LogMeIn Recon \/ Keylogger\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis particular sample is responsible for collecting LogMeIn account information, logging keystrokes and mouse-clicks, and periodically exfiltrating this data to a remote server. This sample shares a number of characteristics with the FindPOS samples previously discovered. Some of these similarities include the installation process, URI scheme, format of the HTTP POST requests, and the PDB string.\r\n\r\nUpon execution, this malware will install itself in the same method as FindPOS. Additionally, a mutex is created using the technique previously mentioned. The malware will attempt determine if LogMeIn Ignition is installed on the victim machine by checking the following registry keys:\r\nHKCU\\Software\\LogMeIn Ignition\\[Variable Hash]\\Account : Email\r\nAny discovered emails are exfiltrated using the same HTTP POST requests witnessed in FindPOS. However, instead of using the \u2018data\u2019 POST parameter, this particular sample uses the \u2018logs\u2019 parameter. This can be seen below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe malware proceeds to log keystrokes and mouse clicks. This data is exfiltrated every two minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile this sample certainly could have been used to scrape track data from POS terminals that have card readers that emulate keyboard devices, I suspect this sample was more likely used to gain access to more POS machines. It is most likely that this sample was dropped on a machine that was administering multiple POS machines, and the information obtained from this particular box was leveraged to gain access to said POS machines.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s also interesting to note that the compile timestamp for this particular sample lines up to just about two weeks after the introduction of keylogging functionality (starting in version 5.90). It would appear that right around this time the malware author added a new trick to his or her repertoire.\r\nConclusion\r\nOverall, FindPOS isn\u2019t terribly sophisticated. It lacks a number of features that we\u2019ve seen in previous malware families, such as a more sophisticated command and control structure, stronger encryption, and performing luhn checks on any discovered data. Additionally, the evolution of this family provides interesting clues to the notion that this malware was written from scratch. While FindPOS may share minimal similarities with previously witnessed malware families, we are strongly confident that this malware is a brand new family.\r\n\r\nWhile this malware doesn\u2019t show strong sophistication, the large number of variants shows prevalence similar to families such as Alina and Backoff. It is clear that FindPOS should be considered a strong threat to Microsoft Windows POS vendors, and measures should be taken to ensure protection.\r\n\r\nSuch measures include, but are not limited to, configuring two-factor authentication for any remote access services (LogMeIn, VNC, RDP, etc.), ensuring anti-virus is installed and updated, and ensuring POS devices are not used non-approved functions, such as browsing the web or checking email.\r\n\r\nPalo Alto Networks customers are protected by WildFire, which automatically classifies FindPOS samples as malware. Additionally, the indicators we've discovered that are related to these attacks have been added to PANDB and Anti-Malware protection systems.\r\nAppendix\r\nSample Information\r\nVersion 2.0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion 2.1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion 5.57\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion 5.80\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion 5.90\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion 6.0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion 6.02\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion 6.03\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion 6.04\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYARA Rule\r\nimport \"cuckoo\"\r\n\r\nrule findpos\r\n{\r\n\tmeta:\r\n\t\tdescription = \"FindPOS is a newly discovered POS family.\"\r\n\t\tcategory = \"Point of Sale\"\r\n\t\tauthor = \"Josh Grunzweig\"\r\n\r\n\tstrings:\r\n\t\t$s1 = \"oprat=2&amp;uid=%I64u&amp;uinfo=%s&amp;win=%d.%d&amp;vers=%s\" nocase wide ascii\r\n\r\n\t\t$pdb1 = \"H:\\\\Work\\\\Current\\\\FindStr\\\\Release\\\\FindStr.pdb\" nocase wide ascii\r\n\t\t$pdb2 = \"H:\\\\Work\\\\FindStrX\\\\Release\\\\FindStr.pdb\" nocase wide ascii\r\n    \t\t$pdb3 = \"H:\\\\Work\\\\Current\\\\KeyLogger\\\\Release\\\\KeyLogger.pdb\" nocase wide ascii\r\n\r\n\tcondition:\r\n\t\tany of ($s*) or\r\n\t\tany of ($pdb*) or\r\n        (\r\n          cuckoo.sync.mutex(\/WIN_[a-fA-F0-9]{16}\/) and\r\n          cuckoo.registry.key_access(\/\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Run\/) and\r\n          (\r\n              cuckoo.filesystem.file_access(\/C\\:\\\\WINDOWS\\\\System32\\\\\\w{8}\\.exe\/) or\r\n              cuckoo.filesystem.file_access(\/C\\:\\\\Documents\\ and\\ Settings\\\\[^\\\\]+\\\\\\w{8}\\.exe\/)\r\n          )\r\n        )\r\n}\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","@id":"#panworg"},"image":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"","width":"","height":""},"speakable":{"@type":"SpeakableSpecification","xPath":["\/html\/head\/title","\/html\/head\/meta[@name='description']\/@content"]},"author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Josh Grunzweig"}]}</script><link rel='stylesheet' id='crayon-css' href='https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/plugins/crayon-syntax-highlighter/css/min/crayon.min.css?ver=_2.7.2_beta' media='all' />

Over the past few weeks we have been analyzing this malware family, which we have dubbed ‘FindPOS’ due to strings consistently found in each variant.</p>
<p>While this malware doesn’t show strong sophistication, the large number of variants shows prevalence similar to families such as <a href="https://www.trustwave.com/Resources/SpiderLabs-Blog/Alina--Following-The-Shadow-Part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alina</a> and <a href="https://www.trustwave.com/Resources/SpiderLabs-Blog/Backoff---Technical-Analysis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backoff</a>. It is clear that FindPOS should be considered a strong threat to Microsoft Windows POS vendors, and measures should be taken to ensure protection.</p>
<h3>Workflow</h3>
<p><span id="more-8445"></span>The malware in question has the ability to scrape memory for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_stripe_card" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">track data</a>, exfiltrate any discovered data via HTTP POST requests, and in some instances log keystrokes. While the malware family uses many common techniques witnessed in previous malware families targeting POS devices, the prevalence and continued development of this malware demonstrates a threat to those running Windows-based point of sale terminals.</p>
<p>The general workflow of the FindPOS malware family can be seen below.</p>
<p><a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/workflow_pos.png" rel="wpdevart_lightbox"><img  class="aligncenter wp-image-8446 size-large lozad"  data-src="http://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/workflow_pos-500x274.png" alt="workflow_pos" width="500" height="274" /></a></p>
<h3>Evolution</h3>
<p>Over the course of our research, a total of nine variants of FindPOS have been discovered. Using compile timestamp information, we can see a timeline of these variants below.</p>
<p><a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Timestamps_pos.png" rel="wpdevart_lightbox"><img  class="aligncenter wp-image-8447 size-large lozad"  data-src="http://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Timestamps_pos-500x405.png" alt="Timestamps_pos" width="500" height="405" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A breakdown of the specific functionality changes between versions is as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Version 2.1</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Modified hashing algorithm to use the following information:
<ul>
<li>Volume Serial Number</li>
<li>Networking Adapters (IPv4 Only)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added ‘uinfo’ POST parameter</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Version 5.57</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added ability to terminate previously installed FindPOS upon installation</li>
<li>Code cleanup during install</li>
<li>Set main thread to lowest priority</li>
<li>Added memory scraping checks
<ul>
<li>Expiration year between 2014 and 2030</li>
<li>Expiration month between 1 and 12</li>
<li>Service code set to either ‘101’ or ‘201’</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added ability to download/execute files</li>
<li>Removed ‘Cookie: income=1’ HTTP Header</li>
<li>Added User-Agent HTTP Header</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Version 5.80</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Modified memory scraping checks
<ul>
<li>Expiration year cannot exceed 2030 (no lower bound check)</li>
<li>Expiration month cannot exceed 12 (no lower bound check)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Code enhancements to domain/URI configuration</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Version 5.90</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added keylogging functionality</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Version 6.0</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No significant changes identified</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Version 6.02</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Minor modifications to exfiltration function</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Version 6.03</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No significant changes identified</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Version 6.04</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Minor modifications to exfiltration sleep timer</li>
</ul>
<p>As we can see from the above timeline, FindPOS appears to have been very actively developed early on, while over time the author made minimal changes. These minimal changes were likely made for performance reasons or potentially bug fixes.</p>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>Upon execution, FindPOS will generate a lowercase alphabetic executable name of eight characters (example: abodeign.exe). This name is generated using the following system information:</p>
<ul>
<li>C:\ Volume Serial Number</li>
<li>SystemBiosdate</li>
<li>VideoBiosdate</li>
<li>CPU Identifier</li>
<li>Microsoft Windows ProductId</li>
</ul>
<p>Using these values in order to generate results in a consistently generated name when run on the same machine. Please note that the hashing algorithm used was modified in version 2.1. Please refer to the ‘Evolution’ section above for details.</p>
<p>This executable name is then compared against the original executable name of the running malware. Should those names not match, the malware will proceed to continue with its installation routine.</p>
<p>FindPOS proceeds to copy itself to the following directories using the executable name that was previously generated:</p>
<ul>
<li>%SystemRoot%\System32\[name].exe</li>
<li>%USERPROFILE%\[name].exe</li>
</ul>
<p>Should these file copy operations prove successful, the malware will write the following registry keys:</p>
<ul>
<li>HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run [name] : %SystemRoot%\System32\[name].exe</li>
<li>HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run [name] : %USERPROFILE%\[name].exe</li>
</ul>
<p>The malware will proceed to spawn a new instance of %SystemRoot%\System32\[name].exe via a call to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms682425%28v=vs.85%29.aspx">CreateProcessA</a>. Should this prove successful, the malware will execute the following command prior to exiting. This command is responsible for deleting the original executable.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>cmd.exe /c del [original_executable_path] &gt;&gt; NUL</em></p>
<p>Should the CreateProcessA call on %SystemRoot%\System32\[name].exe fail, FindPOS will attempt to spawn a new instance of %USERPROFILE%\[name].exe. If this proves successful, FindPOS will attempt to delete the original executable using the same technique previously seen.</p>
<p>After installation of FindPOS is successful, the malware will create a global mutex in order to ensure only one instance of FindPOS is running. This mutex has the following name:</p>
<ul>
<li>WIN_[hex]</li>
</ul>
<p>Where [hex] is a series of 16 uppercase hexadecimal characters that are generated using the same technique witnessed when generating the malware’s executable name during the installation routine.</p>
<p>After this mutex is successfully created, FindPOS will continue to scrape memory and optionally log keystrokes.</p>
<h3>Memory Scraping</h3>
<p>Memory scraping is a technique found in the majority of POS malware families discovered in prior years. The concept is fairly simple: read the memory of running processes on a POS terminal, and look for track data. When a card is swiped on a POS terminal, and the transaction is processed, the card data will often reside in memory unencrypted for a brief period of time. Attackers exploit this weakness in order to find track data.</p>
<p>A common technique for increasing performance of memory scrapers is to denylist a list of commonly seen process names, such as explorer.exe, lsass.exe, csrss.exe, etc. Alternatively, some malware families leverage an allowlist approach, where only specific process names are targeted. FindPOS, however, uses a brand new approach. This particular family determines the owner of every process on the system, via calls to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms682629%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EnumProcesses</a>, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms684320%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenProcess</a>, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa446671%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GetTokenInformation</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa379166%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LookupAccountSid</a>. The owner of the process is then compared against the ‘NT AUTHORITY’ string. This filters out any processes not being run as system or as a service. In the example below, all processes except for ‘dwm.exe’ and the multiple instances of ‘conhost.exe’ would be filtered.</p>
<p><a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/hacker_pos.png" rel="wpdevart_lightbox"><img  class="aligncenter wp-image-8448 size-large lozad"  data-src="http://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/hacker_pos-500x367.png" alt="hacker_pos" width="500" height="367" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 1. Example Running Processes</p>
<p>In the event a process is not filtered, memory is scraped via calls to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa366907%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VirtualQueryEx</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms680553%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ReadProcessMemory</a>. This is a very common approach that is witnessed in almost all memory scrapers.</p>
<p><a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/code_pos.png" rel="wpdevart_lightbox"><img  class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-8449 lozad"  data-src="http://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/code_pos-500x432.png" alt="code_pos" width="500" height="432" /></a></p>
<p>Once the data is read, FindPOS proceeds to look for track data. Starting with version 5.57, the author began making checks based on various data found within the track data. For example, in version 5.57 the author began ignoring any track data that did not have an expiration date between January 2014 to December 2030. This helped to ensure expired card data was not captured.</p>
<p>Additionally, the author paid close attention to the service codes that appeared within any discovered track data. The service code is a three-digit number that represents the type of card being swiped. In this particular instance, the author chose to only capture cards that held the following options:</p>
<p><strong>First Digit</strong> – ‘International interexchange OK’ or ‘International interchange, use IC (chip) where feasible’</p>
<p><strong>Second Digit</strong> – ‘Normal’</p>
<p><strong>Third Digit</strong> – ‘No restrictions’</p>
<p>By adding these restrictions, the author was able to ignore cards that it did not consider to be appealing. Such cards included gift cards, debit cards, and test cards to name a few.</p>
<p>Any discovered track data is stored in memory until exfiltration occurs. This data is exfiltrated via the ‘data’ POST parameter.</p>
<h3>Keylogging</h3>
<p>Starting in version 5.90, the author of FindPOS began adding keylogging to this family. Many magnetic card readers often will emulate a keyboard device. Knowing this, many POS malware authors incorporate this functionality into their families. In addition to collecting track data, keylogging also has the ability to potentially collect usernames, passwords, or other sensitive data on the victim machine.</p>
<p>In order to accomplish this, the author spawns a new thread that is responsible for keylogging. A common technique of creating a new empty window, registering itself as a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms645600%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">raw input device</a>, and making calls to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms645596%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GetRawInputData</a> API is used.</p>
<p><a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/code_pos-2.png" rel="wpdevart_lightbox"><img  class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-8450 lozad"  data-src="http://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/code_pos-2-500x490.png" alt="code_pos 2" width="500" height="490" /></a></p>
<p>Any keystrokes are stored in memory until exfiltration occurs. The keystrokes are exfiltrated via the ‘logs’ POST parameter.</p>
<h3>Exfiltration</h3>
<p>Exfiltration for FindPOS takes place via HTTP POST requests. A number of hardcoded domains are configured for each sample, often varying between FindPOS variants. HTTP POST requests are made every 120 seconds (2 minutes). In the event any data has been discovered, such as track data or keystroke data, this data is included. An example request from version 5.80 is shown below:</p>
<p><a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/post_pos-rev.png" rel="wpdevart_lightbox"><img  class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-8480 lozad"  data-src="http://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/post_pos-rev-500x223.png" alt="post_pos rev" width="500" height="223" /></a></p>
<p>As we can see, a number of POST variables are included in each request:</p>
<p><a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/grid_pos.png" rel="wpdevart_lightbox"><img  class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-8453 lozad"  data-src="http://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/grid_pos-500x117.png" alt="grid_pos" width="500" height="117" /></a></p>
<p>An example of decoding the ‘uinfo’ parameter can be seen below:</p>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; import base64<br />
</em><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; base64.b64decode("Sk9TSC1QQyBAIGpvc2gtUENcam9zaA==")<br />
</em><em>'JOSH-PC @ josh-PC\\josh'</em></p>
<p>Keystroke data and track data is obfuscated using a combination of Base64 encoding and a single-byte XOR encryption. Decoding this data can be seen below:</p>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; import base64<br />
</em><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; raw = ""<br />
</em><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; for s in base64.b64decode("HxkaGxgfGhodGhoaGhsTGxcbHxoSGxobGhMbGBkeHxwdEhMaGxU="):<br />
</em><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;     raw += chr(ord(s) ^ 0x2a)<br />
</em><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; print raw<br />
</em><em>5301250070000191=15081010912345678901?</em></p>
<p>In addition to data exfiltration, FindPOS added the ability to download/execute further malware. Upon sending an exfiltration request, should the server respond with a 0x1 or 0x4 byte, followed by a URL, this file will be downloaded and subsequently executed.</p>
<p>The file is downloaded to a temporary folder, with the file itself prefixed by ‘BN’. This downloaded file is executed via a call to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms682425%28v=vs.85%29.aspx">CreateProcessA</a>. In the event the file cannot be properly downloaded or executed, it is deleted from disk.</p>
<h3>Domain/IP Address Information</h3>
<p>A total of 37 domains were discovered while researching the FindPOS malware family. Of these domains, 13 unique IP addresses were discovered. The geographic location of these IP addresses can be seen below. Please refer to the Appendix for a full list of all domains.</p>

<h4>Related Samples – Keylogging/LogMeIn Recon</h4>
<p>During the course of our research, a number of similar samples were discovered. One such sample can be seen below.</p>
<p><strong>Version 8.3 – LogMeIn Recon / Keylogger</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/grid_pos-2.png" rel="wpdevart_lightbox"><img  class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-8456 lozad"  data-src="http://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/grid_pos-2-500x218.png" alt="grid_pos 2" width="500" height="218" /></a></p>
<p>This particular sample is responsible for collecting LogMeIn account information, logging keystrokes and mouse-clicks, and periodically exfiltrating this data to a remote server. This sample shares a number of characteristics with the FindPOS samples previously discovered. Some of these similarities include the installation process, URI scheme, format of the HTTP POST requests, and the PDB string.</p>
<p>Upon execution, this malware will install itself in the same method as FindPOS. Additionally, a mutex is created using the technique previously mentioned. The malware will attempt determine if LogMeIn Ignition is installed on the victim machine by checking the following registry keys:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>HKCU\Software\LogMeIn Ignition\[Variable Hash]\Account : Email</em></p>
<p>Any discovered emails are exfiltrated using the same HTTP POST requests witnessed in FindPOS. However, instead of using the ‘data’ POST parameter, this particular sample uses the ‘logs’ parameter. This can be seen below:</p>
<p><a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/post_pos-2.png" rel="wpdevart_lightbox"><img  class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-8457 lozad"  data-src="http://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/post_pos-2-500x272.png" alt="post_pos 2" width="500" height="272" /></a></p>
<p>The malware proceeds to log keystrokes and mouse clicks. This data is exfiltrated every two minutes.</p>
<p><a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/post_pos-3.png" rel="wpdevart_lightbox"><img  class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-8458 lozad"  data-src="http://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/post_pos-3-500x311.png" alt="post_pos 3" width="500" height="311" /></a></p>
<p>While this sample certainly could have been used to scrape track data from POS terminals that have card readers that emulate keyboard devices, I suspect this sample was more likely used to gain access to more POS machines. It is most likely that this sample was dropped on a machine that was administering multiple POS machines, and the information obtained from this particular box was leveraged to gain access to said POS machines.</p>
<p>It’s also interesting to note that the compile timestamp for this particular sample lines up to just about two weeks after the introduction of keylogging functionality (starting in version 5.90). It would appear that right around this time the malware author added a new trick to his or her repertoire.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Overall, FindPOS isn’t terribly sophisticated. It lacks a number of features that we’ve seen in previous malware families, such as a more sophisticated command and control structure, stronger encryption, and performing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">luhn</a> checks on any discovered data. Additionally, the evolution of this family provides interesting clues to the notion that this malware was written from scratch. While FindPOS may share minimal similarities with previously witnessed malware families, we are strongly confident that this malware is a brand new family.</p>
<p>While this malware doesn’t show strong sophistication, the large number of variants shows prevalence similar to families such as <a href="https://www.trustwave.com/Resources/SpiderLabs-Blog/Alina--Following-The-Shadow-Part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alina</a> and <a href="https://www.trustwave.com/Resources/SpiderLabs-Blog/Backoff---Technical-Analysis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backoff</a>. It is clear that FindPOS should be considered a strong threat to Microsoft Windows POS vendors, and measures should be taken to ensure protection.</p>
<p>Such measures include, but are not limited to, configuring two-factor authentication for any remote access services (LogMeIn, VNC, RDP, etc.), ensuring anti-virus is installed and updated, and ensuring POS devices are not used non-approved functions, such as browsing the web or checking email.</p>
<p>Palo Alto Networks customers are protected by WildFire, which automatically classifies FindPOS samples as malware. Additionally, the indicators we've discovered that are related to these attacks have been added to PANDB and Anti-Malware protection systems.</p>
