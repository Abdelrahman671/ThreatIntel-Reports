Volt Typhoon：
A Conspiratorial Swindling Campaign targets with

Apr. 15th, 2024
Executive summary
“Volt Typhoon” was labeled as a People's Republic of China State-Sponsored Cyber Actor by
Microsoft and the cybersecurity authorities from The Five Eyes countries. But further
analysis shows that the evidence of attribution is so insufficient that the actor has more
correlation with ransomware group or other cybercriminals. Multiple cybersecurity
authorities of U.S. made this fiction up together just for more budgets from the congress.
Meanwhile, Microsoft and other U.S. cybersecurity companies also want more big contracts
from U.S. cybersecurity authorities. The truth of “Volt Typhoon” is a conspiratorial swindling
campaign which intended to “kill two birds with one stone” by hyping the "China threat
theory" and cheating money from the U.S. congress and taxpayers.
1 Introduction
On 11:00 AM E.T. January 31, 2024, the hearing1 of The CCP Cyber Threat to the American
Homeland and National Security was held by the select committee on China of the U.S.
House of Representatives in Washington. The hearing was hosted by the chairman of the
special committee, the republican Mike Gallgher. The head of Big 4 of U.S. cybersecurity
agencies attended the hearing as witnesses, including Paul Nakasong, then Commander of
U.S. Cyber Command and Chief of National Security Angency (NSA), Jen Easterly, Director of
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Secruity Angency, Christopher Wray, Director of Federal
Bureau of Investigation(FBI), Harry Coker,Jr. ,Director of Office of the National Cyber Director.
At the beginning of the hearing, Mike Gallgher claimed that a People's Republic of China
State-Sponsored Cyber Actor called "Volt Typhoon", which disclosed by Microsoft in May
2023 and , launched attacks on U.S. critical infrastructure sectors and trying to further
damage, posed a serious threat to the U.S. national security. Later, the four witnesses further
embellished it, depicting China as a "demon" who could readily subvert U.S. governments
and even kill the American people by cyber attack and destroying critical infrastructures.
Although we have long been used to the habitual tactics of a thief crying "stop thief" taken
by United States politicians, such a spectacle is rare. We can not help wondering, who is
"Volt Typhoon"? What is the evidence of its link to the Chinese government? Since the
attacks were disclosed in May last year, why did US politicians challenge China again after
eight months? This paper will explore the above issues, in order to clarify the truth.
2 Brief History of Volt Typhoon
On May 24th , 2023, the cybersecurity authorities from The Five Eyes countries, U.S., U.K.,
Australia, Canada and New Zealand, aka FVE, isssued a joint Cybersecurity Advisory2 (CSA)
titled by "People's Republic of China State-Sponsored Cyber Actor Living off the Land to

Evade Detection". The CSA said that, they had discovered cluster of activity of interest
associated with a People’s Republic of China (PRC) state-sponsored cyber actor, also known
as Volt Typhoon, and this activity affected networks across U.S. critical infrastructure sectors.
The CSA used a report from Microsoft as its main reference, which is "Volt Typhoon targets
US critical infrastructure with living-off-the-land techniques" written by Microsoft Threat
Intelligence3 and published on the same day of CSA. The report of Microsoft is also the
source of the name of "Volt Typhoon", which come from the new threat actor naming
taxonomy of Microsoft. Microsoft claimed that the Volt Typhoon is a state-sponsored actor
based in China that typically focuses on espionage and information gathering. Microsoft also
introduced the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of the actor. It is said that Volt
Typhoon achieves initial access to targeted organizations through exploit internet-facing
network devices such as firewalls and compromised SOHO network edge devices (including
routers), then they rely on living-off-the-land(LOTL) commands for avoid-detection to take
lateral-movement and exfiltrate data.
LOTL attack, also called file-less attack, is becoming a popular technique for bypassing AV
detection. Unlike traditional malware attacks, LOTL do not require an attacker to install any
code or scripts within the target system. Instead, the attacker uses tools that are already
present in the environment, such as PowerShell, Windows Management Instrumentation
(WMI) or the password-saving tool, Mimikatz, to carry out the attack. And the malicious code
can be injected directly into memory without requiring anything to be written to disk.
Although the CSA and the report of Microsoft described the TTPs and IoCs of Volt Typhoon,
they just labeled it a "China State-Sponsored Cyber Actor" without any attribution details.
Once released, the reports were widely forwarded by major news media such as Reuters,
Wall Street Journal and New York Times. The New York Times also reported4 that United
States intelligence agencies identified cyberattacks against telecom operator in Guam and
other U.S. territory, and connected it with the CSA.
Until end of the year 2023, there is no news related. Suddenly in Dec. 13th , 2023 , the Black
Lotus Labs team at Lumen Technologies, which is third large fixed network carriers in the U.S.,
released a report5 titled with "Routers Roasting On An Open FireWall". In the report, Black
Lotus Labs claimed that Volt Typhoon had used the KV-Botnet as hop and covert network,
and the attribution was based on similar techniques used against victims based in Guam
from August 2022 through May 2023, and both of them exploited NetGear devices. The
Lumen’s report became a trigger, U.S government then took a series of actions. In Jan 31st ,
2024, U.S. Department of Justice released a press6 titled with "U.S. Government Disrupts
Botnet People’s Republic of China Used to Conceal Hacking of Critical Infrastructure", and
said that the court-authorized operation had deleted the KV Botnet malware from hundreds

of routers nationwide. In the same day of Jan 31st , 2024, CISA and FBI joint published a
Secure by Design Alert: Security Design Improvements for SOHO Device Manufacturers7, and
pointed out that the guidance based upon "recent and ongoing activity targeting small
office/home office (SOHO) routers by malicious cyber actors—particularly the People’s
Republic of China (PRC)-sponsored Volt Typhoon group". And then, don’t forget the hearing
held by the select committee on China of the U.S. House of Representatives in the same day
also.
As a supplement, the name of "Volt Typhoon" is originated from the new threat actor
naming taxonomy of Microsoft published in April 20238. As shown in Figure 1, a weather
event or "family name" represents either a nation-state actor attribution9 , and Typhoon
indicates origin or attribution to China. There are only 8 nation-state actors so far, and of
course, none of them is FVE country.

From above, we can conclude that, the attribution of Volt Typhoon is mostly based on the report
of Microsoft and CSA issued by FVE countries.
3 Is Volt Typhoon really a Nation-State Actor ?
As mentioned above, "Volt Typhoon" is named and attributed from the Microsoft’s technical
analysis report and the alert notifications of the FVE. Microsoft mentioned "the threat actor
puts strong emphasis on stealth in this campaign", which increased the difficulty for

Obtaining evidence and attribution. Although Microsoft and FVE didn't provide the detail of
attribution, the Indicators of Compromise(IoCs) of the attacks were given at the end of both
reports, which could lead us to take further analysis.
First of all, we made statistics of the sample information given by both reports. Totally, we
got 29 samples after removing duplicates, as shown in Table 1.
Then, we used VirusTotal10 (a Multi-engine Virus Scanner platform of Google, hereinafter
referred to as "VT") to search the samples one by one. As a result, only 13 samples could be
found, and each sample is associated with multiple IP addresses. Take sample 1 for example,
the search results are shown in Figure 2.

Whereafter, we used VT again to analyze the 5 IP addresses in the set, further discovered
that these addresses are related to a lot of cyber attack events, and there are multiple IP
addresses associated with the same cyber attack event or cybersecurity risk. One of them
with connection of all 5 IP addresses is a Ransomware Group named Dark Power. And it is
related to a report11 "The Rise of Dark Power:
A Close Look at the Group and their
Ransomware" published by ThreatMon(a U.S. cybersecurity vendor located in VA) on April 11,
2023. Shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4.

We downloaded the report from the link, and expected to find those IP addresses in it.
Strangely, although the report table of contents shows that the list of IP is on page 16, there
is no relevant information on page 16 as the last page of report. Shown in Figure 5 and Figure
6.

At first, we thought the report maybe contained a textual error, and we tried to find the file
of IoCs on the GitHub repository of ThreatMon. However, we just found the file hashes of the
report12 but did not find the IPs , as shown in Figure 7. Moreover, the upload date is May 8th ,
2023, not April 11th or near.

However, we were so lucky to find out that the back cover of report is not just a picture, after
moving the picture, we found the IP list, which contains all 5 IP addresses as mentioned
above. Shown in Figure 8 and Figure 9.

Although we were puzzled by what ThreatMon did, we read the report carefully. In this
report, ThreatMon Threat Intelligence team revealed a ransomware group who claimed
themself "Dark Power". According to ThreatMon, Dark Power was first observed to have
started its attacks in January 2023, which means the group was active before 2023. And at
least 10 institutions worldwide were attacked and blackmailed by Dark Power in March 2023
alone, and "there was no country and sectoral connection". The victims were from Algeria,
Egypt, the Czech Republic, Turkey, Israel, Peru, France and the US. The Dark Power uses the
typical "double extortion" technique, that is, first hacking into the victim's internal network
to steal data and then encrypt them, in addition to crypto extortion, the victim is threatened
with the disclosure of sensitive internal data on the internet if the ransom is not paid on time.
The report described the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) of Dark Power in detail,
which indicated that Dark Power also used the living-off-the-land techniques. They used the
Windows Management tool (WMI) to shut down the system process and clear the footprint
by deleting system log generated during the attack before the end of the attack, and finally
leave a ransom note to inform the victim. As shown in Figure 10.
Figure 10. The ransom note of Dark Power
It's worth noting that, according to a report13 of TheRecord.media, which owned by another
U.S. cybersecurity company Recorded Future, published on March 21, 2023, Guam's largest
telecommunications company, DOCOMO PACIFIC (a wholly owned subsidiary of Japan's NTT
DOCOMO), was hit by a cyber attack on March 16, 2023, resulting in service disruptions. It
pointed out that several Pacific island countries, including Tonga and Vanuatu, have been
attacked by ransomware groups. DOCOMO PACIFIC also acknowledged the incident14.
In addition, we used VT to search the malware samples and IP address in the report
published by Lumen Technologies about the KV-Botnet, but could not find any link to the
IoCs of the Microsoft’s technical analysis report and the CSA of FVE.

At this point, based on analysis result above, we found that the actor is more likely a
cybercrime group, and obviously, the attribution of Microsoft and FVE was very hasty.
Obviously , that is abnormal, but we believe everything happens for a reason, so we dig a
little deeper and found some interest things.
4 Money, Money, Money
As above mentioned, it is easy to find out that Jan 31st, 2024, was a crucial time node for the
U.S. Congress, U.S. government cybersecurity authorities, and U.S. cybersecurity enterprises.
On the same day, U.S. Congress, U.S. Department of Justice, and U.S. Department of
Homeland Security jointly take a combination of actions against Volt Typhoon.
Why Jan 31st? In fact, under the Budget and Accounting Act15 issued by 1921, the U.S.
president must submit a budget report, including the federal government's budget request
for the next fiscal year, to Congress by the first Monday in February, which is Feb 5th of this
year. This explains why the hearing held by the House Select Committee on China on that day
fulfilled with "Begging for Money".
Firstly, witnesses who attended the hearing, the heads of the NSA, the CISA, the FBI, and the
ONCD hyped the "China threat theory" again and again, asked Congress to further increase
more funds in the field of cybersecurity.
Secondly, the 2024 presidential election is attracting worldwide attention, and both the
Republican and Democratic parties do not want to "lose votes" on the issue of China, by
openly "denouncing" China, members of Congress can also improve their exposure and gain
good political capital, and some lawmakers even clamor to counter China and ban TikTok.
Finally, network security companies certainly hope that the U.S.federal government, the
most affluent major clients, will have a bigger and bigger wallet, and the "China threat
theory" has become the best marketing advertisement for these companies to explore the
European and American markets.
Eventually, in the 2025 fiscal year budget16 request announced by the Biden administration
on March 11, 2024, the federal government's cybersecurity budget in the civil administrative
departments and agencies reached a record $13 billion, a 10% increase from the 2024 fiscal
year. Among them, the budget for the CISA reached $3 billion, an increase of $103 million
from the previous year. The budgets of the U.S. Department of Justice and the FBI increased
by $25 million specifically for the "cyber and counterintelligence investigative capabilities."
Of course, as a subordinate unit of the U.S. Department of Defense with a total budget of
$850 billion, the National Security Agency has never worried about budget issues.

Furthermore, we also observed some details. Just two months before Microsoft released its
report, on March 24, 2023, Microsoft received the first batch of task orders17 for the $9
billion Joint Warfighting Cloud (JWCC) project from the U.S. Department of Defense. And one
month before Lumen Technologies released an analysis report linking the KV-Botnet to the
Volt Typhoon, on November 7, 2023, Lumen Technologies had just won a five-year contract18
order worth $110 million from the U.S. Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA).
In short, U.S. politicians, officials, and entrepreneurs are all making a fortune from the Volt
Typhoon. And the essence of above is to vainly attempt to defame China, disrupt
relationships between China and partner countries, delay the pace of economic
development of China, which should be exposed to whole world.
5 Conclusion
We acknowledged that the attribution of cyber attacks is an international stubborn problem.
The leak of cyber weapons and the rapid proliferation of offensive and defensive
technologies have led to a significant increase in the technical level of cyber criminals. As
early as 2016, Mirai, the first generation of the IoT botnet, caused a wide range of Internet
outages in the United States, while the Colonial Pipeline attacked by ransomware, which led
to a state of emergency in parts of the United States and the battle between Pro-Russian and
pro-Ukrainian hacker groups in the Russia-Ukraine conflict have fully demonstrated that,
some ransomware groups and botnet operators have more resources and technical
capabilities than the average state, and have even been able to reach the level of cyber
warfare. At the same time, ransomware organizations and botnet operators have long
established a mature underground eco-system, driven by interests, these cyber criminal
gangs are increasingly rampant. These Internet hazards are a common threat to all countries
in the world, including China and the United States. However, the U.S. government and
politicians always keep "few banding together" and "small yard and high fence" policies, and
even politicizing cyber attacks origin-tracing, manipulating Microsoft and other companies to
conduct media smear campaign against China, and just for filling their own pockets. These
"Volt Typhoon" narratives won’t be any beneficial to the normal order of the international
public cyberspace but only undermine China-US relations, and finally eat their own bitter
fruit.
At last, we would like to express our appreciation to 360 Digital Security Group for providing
technical support on attribution.
