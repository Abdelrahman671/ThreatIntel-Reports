September 2023 Threat Trend Report on APT Groups 
6 
Objectives and Scope 
In this report, we cover nation-led threat groups presumed to conduct cyber espionage or 
sabotage under the support of the governments of certain countries, referred to as "Advanced 
Persistent Threat (APT) groups" for the sake of convenience. Therefore, this report does not 
contain information on cybercriminal groups aiming to gain financial profits. 
 
We organized analyses related to APT groups disclosed by security companies and institutions 
including AhnLab during the previous month; however, the content of some APT groups may 
not have been included. 
 
The names and classification criteria may vary depending on the security company or 
researcher, and in this report, we used well-known names of AhnLab Threat Intelligence 
Platform (ATIP)'s threat actors. 
 
APT Group Trends 
The cases of major APT groups for September 2023 gathered from materials made public by 
security companies and institutions are as follows. 
 
1)  APT28 
 
CERT-UA discovered targeted attacks by the APT28 group on critical energy infrastructure 
facilities in Ukraine.1 
 
The attack was carried out via email. When a user clicks on a link, a bait JPG image and a ZIP 
file with a CMD extension are downloaded. 
 
When the CMD file is executed, several bait web pages are opened, followed by the generation 
of BAT and VBS files. Afterward, the TOR program is downloaded, and communication is 
established through TOR for the group to attempt information gathering on the affected

September 2023 Threat Trend Report on APT Groups 
7 
system. 
 
Remote execution is enabled through the webhook.site service's API. Additional details were 
disclosed by Splunk.2 
 
2)  APT29 
 
Mandiant disclosed that during the first half of 2023, APT29 expanded its phishing operations 
in the diplomatic sector, observing various changes in security technologies as the attacker 
group sought to achieve its aim.3 
 
These activities are primarily related to Ukraine, and Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) 
is currently utilizing them for tactical information gathering. APT29 employs methods such as 
sending malicious file attachments in emails and including links to hacked websites. 
 
3)  APT33 (Peach Sandstorm) 
 
Microsoft announced that the APT33 (Peach Sandstorm) group has been conducting a 
password spray campaign targeting thousands of organizations since February 2023. 4 
Password spraying is a form of brute force attack that involves using password combinations 
that have been carefully calculated with high chances of success against the targeted user 
base to perform preemptive attacks. This method is used because too many failed login 
attempts can lock an account. 
 
Microsoft assessed that APT33 (Peach Sandstorm)'s initial access campaign may be aimed at 
supporting Iran's national interests through information collection. 
 
Between February and July 2023, the group conducted password spray attacks that 
attempted authentication on thousands of environments. If an account was successfully

8 
authenticated via password spraying, APT33 members used AzureHound or Roadtools to 
perform reconnaissance on the Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory). 
 
In their efforts to access target environments, they also attempted attacks exploiting 
vulnerabilities in Zoho ManageEngine (CVE-2022-47966) and Confluence (CVE-2022-26134). 
 
4)  Andariel 
 
360 released information on the Andariel group's EarlyRat malware variant.5 The threat actor 
sent bait file download links through Skype. When a user activates the malicious macro, the 
threat actor would exfiltrate the user's information and execute malicious commands. 
 
5)  BlackTech 
 
A government organization from the US issued a warning in collaboration with Japan 
regarding the BlackTech group suspected of being backed by China.6 BlackTech primarily 
targets overseas subsidiaries of US and Japanese companies. After gaining initial access to 
the target company's network, the group obtains network administrator privileges and 
modifies the firmware of network equipment. 
 
6)  Charming Kitten 
 
ESET discovered that the Charming Kitten group's new backdoor, Sponsor, has been used in 
attacks targeting Brazil, Israel, and the United Arab Emirates.7 
 
The group exploited the Microsoft Exchange server vulnerability (CVE-2021-26855) for 
infection and utilized open-source tools such as Chisel, Mimikatz, Plink, and ProcDump. 
 
The threat actors distributed batch files to the victim's system before deploying the Sponsor

9 
backdoor. The batch file does not operate without configuration files. 
 
7)  Dark River 
 
Positive Technologies conducted an investigation into incidents in Russian industrial 
companies and discovered a new malware called MataDoor with the threat actor named as the 
DarkRiver group.8 
 
Its initial attack method is suspected of involving phishing emails with DOCX document 
attachments, and a portion of the MataDoor that was used in the attacks is also linked to 
Lazarus' meta cluster.9 
 
The names of the malware executables were similar to the names of legitimate software 
installed on systems, and a number of samples had valid digital signatures. The executable 
files and libraries were packed with Themida to make them more difficult to analyze. 
 
8)  Earth Lusca 
 
Trend Micro confirmed attacks by the Earth Lusca group targeting government organizations 
related to diplomacy, technology, and communication sectors in Southeast Asian and Balkan 
Peninsula countries.10 
 
The Earth Lusca group exploits vulnerabilities in public servers such as Fortinet (CVE-2022-
40684 and CVE-2022-39952), GitLab (CVE-2021-22205), Zimbra Collaboration (CVE-2019-
9670 and CVE-2019-9621), and Microsoft Exchange (CVE-2021-34473, CVE-2021-34523, 
and CVE-2021-31207). 
 
A new backdoor has also been discovered. This backdoor, called SprySOCKS, is built on the 
Linux platform and based on the open-source Windows backdoor Trochilus.

10 
SprySOCKS provides robust features to perform various network activities alongside a SOCKS 
proxy. The group utilized this backdoor to infiltrate systems and deploy Cobalt Strike. 
 
9)  EvilBamboo 
 
Volexity identified the EvilBamboo (EvilEye) group as actively targeting Tibet, Uyghur, and 
Taiwan individuals and organizations.11 
 
It is suspected that this group operates in the interest of the Chinese government. In 
September 2019, it conducted operations using Android malware targeting Uyghur and 
Tibetan communities. In April 2020, the group used a Safari vulnerability to infect the iOS 
devices of Uyghur users with iOS malware. 
 
10)  Gallium (Alloy Taurus) 
 
Palo Alto announced that the Gallium group suspected of having Chinese backing is 
conducting ongoing cyber espionage activities targeting government organizations in 
Southeast Asia.12 
 
This group has been exploiting vulnerabilities in Exchange servers from early 2022 to the 
middle of 2023, infecting them with malware including web shells, GhostRAT, QuasarRAT, 
Reshell, and Winnti. 
 
 
11) Gelsemium 
 
Palo Alto disclosed the activities suspected to be from the Gelsemium group, which has 
attacked Southeast Asian government organizations.13

13 https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/rare-possible-gelsemium-attack-targets-se-asia/ 
September 2023 Threat Trend Report on APT Groups 
11 
Over a period of more than six months from 2022 to 2023, the threat actors secured a secret 
foothold and collected information from sensitive IIS servers within government organizations 
in Southeast Asia. 
 
Major backdoors used in these activities include OwlProxy and SessionManager, which were 
employed in attacks on several organizations in 2020. 
 
12)  Kimsuky 
 
AhnLab revealed an increase in the RandomQuery activity of the Kimsuky group.14 PowerShell 
scripts are being obfuscated. 
 
13) Konni 
 
Knownsec404 Team revealed that the Konni group, which is suspected to be backed by North 
Korea, is exploiting the WinRAR vulnerability (CVE-2023-38831) to target the cryptocurrency 
industry.15 
 
The threat actor sent a file named wallet_Screenshot_2023_09_06_Qbao_Network.rar to the 
victim. When the victim opens the Screenshot_2023_09_06_Qbao_Network.html file within 
the compressed archive, the system becomes infected with malware using the vulnerable 
WinRAR. 
 
The malware checks system information and User Account Control (UAC) settings and uses 
the appropriate UAC bypass techniques to execute malicious programs with cryptocurrency-
related features. 
 
Genians disclosed cases of targeted attacks against personnel in the unification and North 
Korean human rights sectors.16 The threat actor used email addresses similar to official emails

to disguise the email as being sent from South Korea's Ministry of Unification and North 
Korean human rights organizations. 
 
14) Lazarus 
 
ESET revealed an attack case of the Lazarus group targeting an employee of a Spanish 
aerospace company through LinkedIn.17 
 
The threat actor posed as a recruitment manager and contacted the victim through LinkedIn 
Messaging, deceiving the person into running the malware disguised as coding questions or 
quizzes seemingly as part of the hiring process. 
 
In this attack, a new malware named LightlessCan was discovered. This malware exhibits more 
advanced features compared to the previous one BlindingCan and includes techniques to 
obstruct detection and analysis by security programs. 
 
15) Lucky Mouse (APT27, Budworm) 
 
Symantec discovered the activities of the LuckyMouse (Budworm, Emissary Panda, and APT27) 
group targeting telecommunication companies in the Middle East and governments in Asia.18 
 
In this attack, a new version of the SysUpdate backdoor was discovered. However, aside from 
collecting authentication information, it did not exhibit other malicious activities. 
 
16) Mustang Panda (Steately Taurus) 
 
Palo Alto disclosed that the Mustang Panda (Stately Taurus) group, suspected to have Chinese 
backing, is conducting persistent cyberattacks against Southeast Asian governments.19

September 2023 Threat Trend Report on APT Groups 
13 
This group has been active from at least the second quarter of 2021 through the third quarter 
of 2023 and has exfiltrated sensitive documents and other file types. 
 
Malware types such as Cobalt Strike, Shadowpad, and Toneshell were used in its attacks. 
 
17) OilRig 
 
ESET analyzed the attacks by the OilRig group against Israeli organizations in 2021 and 
2022.20 In both campaigns, Visual Basic Script (VBS) droppers were used. 
 
Trend Micro discovered activities believed to be associated with the OilRig group that attacked 
Saudi Arabia.21 The group distributed a new malware called Menorah, which bears similarities 
to the SideTwist backdoor. 
 
18) Red Eyes (APT37) 
 
AhnLab revealed that the Red Eyes group is still conducting attacks using CHM and LNK files.22 
 
The group employs highly interesting topics to lure users into clicking, such as the release of 
Fukushima wastewater23 and the North Korean leader's visit to Russia24. 
 
The malicious CHM or LNK files used in the attacks execute PowerShell scripts to carry out 
malicious activities. 
 
19) Redfly 
 
Symantec found evidence that the Redfly group used the ShadowPad malware to compromise

14 
the national grid of an Asian country for up to six months.25 
 
Although Redfly shares some similarities with APT41, it appears the group focuses more on 
attacking critical national infrastructures. It used ShadowPad, Keylogger, Packerloader, and 
other malware types in its attacks. 
 
20) Sandman 
 
SentinelLabs monitored the activities of the Sandman group which primarily targets 
telecommunications providers in the Middle East, Western Europe, and South Asia.26 
 
The LuaDream malware used by the group relies on the LuaJIT platform which is relatively 
rarely used. 
 
LuaJIT is typically used as a scripting middleware in games as well as special embedded 
applications and appliances. 
 
21) Stealth Falcon 
 
ESET discovered the Deadglyph malware attributed to the Stealth Falcon group which is 
suspected to be backed by the United Arab Emirates (UAE).27 The Stealth Falcon group is 
carrying out espionage activities in the Middle East region. 
 
Deadglyph is composed to have the x64 executable and .NET file work together, and backdoor 
commands are configured through the additional modules received from the C&C server. 
 
22) Transparent Tribe 
 
SentinelOne discovered the Transparent Tribe group's Android version of CapraRAT.28

September 2023 Threat Trend Report on APT Groups 
15 
CapraRAT is based on the AndroRAT source code and is disguised as popular apps like YouTube. 
It can collect data from the microphones, cameras, SMS, etc. of infected Android devices and 
control that data. 
 
Conclusion 
 
Information on a total of 22 APT groups was released in September 2023. The ongoing Russia-
Ukraine conflict has heightened espionage activities in the conflict area, and the activities of 
Chinese groups in Southeast Asia have also garnered attention. A few months ago, the 
activities of a North Korean threat group were identified targeting Russian defense companies. 
There is a possibility for attacks to be reduced in the future after the summit meeting between 
North Korea and Russia. Additionally, the Israel-Hamas war that started in early October 2023 
raises concerns about cyberattacks by threat groups supporting either side.  
 
The attack methods of many APT groups often involve sending emails with content that may 
pique the recipient's interest along with a link or an executable, CHM, or LNK disguised as a 
document file. 
 
State-led threat actors' targets include the security, energy, diplomatic, political, cutting-edge 
technology, and aerospace sectors. Thus, these sectors must implement a phase-by-phase 
response system to defend against state-led attacks and ensure visibility for their internal 
system. It is also advised to use threat intelligence (TI) services to receive updates on the 
trends of major threat groups and prepare against their attack targets and techniques.
