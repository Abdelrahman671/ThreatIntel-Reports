APT43
Executive Summary
	• APT43 is a prolific cyber operator that supports the interests of the North Korean regime. The group 
combines moderately-sophisticated technical capabilities with aggressive social engineering tactics, 
especially against South Korean and U.S.-based government organizations, academics, and think tanks 
focused on Korean peninsula geopolitical issues.
	• In addition to its espionage campaigns, we believe APT43 funds itself through cybercrime operations to 
support its primary mission of collecting strategic intelligence.
	• The group creates numerous spoofed and fraudulent personas for use in social engineering, as well as 
cover identities for purchasing operational tooling and infrastructure.
	• APT43 has collaborated with other North Korean espionage operators on multiple operations, 
underscoring the major role APT43 plays in the regime’s cyber apparatus.

Threat Details
Mandiant assesses with high confidence that APT43 is a 
moderately-sophisticated cyber operator that supports the 
interests of the North Korean regime. Campaigns attributed to 
APT43 include strategic intelligence collection aligned with 
Pyongyang’s geopolitical interests, credential harvesting and 
social engineering to support espionage activities, and 
financially-motivated cybercrime to fund operations. Tracked 
since 2018, APT43 collection priorities align with the mission of 
the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB), North Korea's main 
foreign intelligence service. The group’s focus on foreign policy 
and nuclear security issues supports North Korea’s strategic and 
nuclear ambitions. However, the group’s focus on health-related 
verticals throughout the majority of 2021, likely in support of 
pandemic response efforts, highlights its responsiveness to 
shifting priorities from Pyongyang.
	• Publicly reported activities attributed to APT43 are frequently 
reported as “Kimsuky” or “Thallium” and include credential 
harvesting and espionage activity most likely intended to 
inform North Korean leadership on ongoing geopolitical 
developments.
	• Their most frequently observed operations are spear-
phishing campaigns supported by spoofed domains and email 
addresses as part of their social engineering tactics. Domains 
masquerading as legitimate sites are used in credential 
harvesting operations.
	• We have not observed APT43 exploiting zero-day 
vulnerabilities.
	• APT43 maintains a high tempo of activity, is prolific in its 
phishing and credential collection campaigns, and has 
demonstrated coordination with other elements of the North 
Korean cyber ecosystem.
	• Targeting is regionally focused on South Korea and the U.S., as 
well as Japan and Europe, especially in the following sectors:
	– government
	– education/research/think tanks focused on geopolitical and 
nuclear policy 
	– business services
	– manufacturing
Although the overall targeting reach is broad, the ultimate aim of 
campaigns is most likely centered around enabling North Korea’s 
weapons program, including: collecting information about 
international negotiations, sanctions policy, and other country’s 
foreign relations and domestic politics as these may affect 
North Korea’s nuclear ambitions.

Shifts in Targeting
Campaigns attributed to APT43 are closely aligned with state 
interests and correlate strongly with geopolitical developments 
that affect Kim Jong-un and the hermit state’s ruling elite. Since 
Mandiant has been tracking APT43, they have consistently 
conducted espionage activity against South Korean and U.S. 
organizations with a stake in security issues affecting the 
Korean peninsula. 
	• Prior to October 2020, APT43 primarily targeted government 
offices, diplomatic organizations, and think tank-related 
entities with a stake in foreign policy and security issues 
affecting the Korean peninsula in South Korea and the U.S.
	• From October 2020 through October 2021, a significant portion 
of APT43 activity targeted on health-related verticals and

pharmaceutical companies, most likely in support of COVID-19 
response efforts in North Korea. Although it is unclear how any 
targeted information benefited the regime, cooperation with 
and across other North Korean cyber operators provides some 
indication of significant resourcing and prioritization of this 
effort during the COVID-19 global pandemic.
	• Throughout this period APT43 espionage campaigns targeting 
South Korea, the U.S., Europe and Japan were ongoing.
	• Notably, observed APT43 activity varied slightly according 
to targeting, including differences in malware deployed. For 
example, the use of VENOMBITE (a loader), SWEETDROP (a 
dropper), and BITTERSWEET (a backdoor) was distinct to 
APT43 activity targeting South Korea during the COVID-19 
pandemic.

	• APT43 poses as reporters and think-tank analysts to build 
rapport with targeted individuals to collect intelligence (Figure 
3). Corroborated by public reporting, the group has convinced 
academics to deliver strategic analysis directly to espionage 
operators.



















	• Technical indicators linked to APT43 partially corroborate 
Korean language reporting that the group targeted South 
Korean political organizations, especially ahead of South 
Korea’s presidential elections in 2022, most likely to glean 
insight into possible policy shifts.
We have some indication that APT43 also carries out internal 
monitoring of other North Korean operations, including non-
cyber activities. APT43 has compromised individual espionage 
actors, including those within its own operations. However it is 
unclear if this is intentional for self-monitoring purposes or 
accidental and indicative of poor operational security.

potential victim by masquerading as a journalist
Cyber Operations
APT43 most commonly leverages tailored spear-phishing emails 
to gain access to victim information. However the group also 
engages in various other activities to support collecting strategic 
intelligence, including using spoofed websites for credential 
harvesting and carrying out cybercrime to fund itself.
	• The actors regularly update lure content and tailor it to the 
specific target audience, particularly around nuclear security 
and non-proliferation.
	• APT43 is adept at creating convincing personas, including 
masquerading as key individuals within their target area (such 
as security and defense), as well as leveraging stolen personally 
identifiable information (PII) to create accounts and register 
domains.
	• APT43 uses highly relevant lure content together with spoofed 
email addresses. 
	– APT43 also leverages contact lists stolen from compromised 
individuals to identify additional targets for spear-phishing 
operations.
	• APT43 steals and launders enough cryptocurrency to buy 
operational infrastructure in a manner aligned with North 
Korea’s juche state ideology of self-reliance, reducing fiscal 
strain on the central government.
Espionage
We consider cyber espionage to be the primary mission for APT43 
and available data indicates that the group’s other activities are 
carried out to support collecting strategic intelligence. 
	• The group is primarily interested in information developed 
and stored within the U.S. military and government, defense 
industrial base (DIB), and research and security policies 
developed by U.S.-based academia and think tanks focused on 
nuclear security policy and nonproliferation. 
	• APT43 has displayed interest in similar industries within 
South Korea, specifically non-profit organizations and 
universities that focus on global and regional policies, as 
well as businesses, such as manufacturing, that can provide 
information around goods whose export to North Korea 
has been restricted. This includes fuel, machinery, metals, 
transportation vehicles, and weapons.

Credential Collection
APT43 operates credential collection campaigns to directly compromise financial data, PII, and client data from entities within the 
academic, manufacturing, and national security industries—especially in South Korea. In particular, the group registers domains 
masquerading as popular search engines, web platforms, and cryptocurrency exchanges in relevant target countries of interest. We 
believe these credentials are used to support operations that further APT43 missions.
	• Collected credential data was used to create online personas and set up infrastructure for cyber espionage operations, including sites 
spoofing legitimate services (Figure 4).
	• The group has leveraged both compromised and actor-owned infrastructure to host and deliver malware to targets and collect 
credentials.
	– Compromised websites were used as part of network infrastructure to deliver both PASSMARK and LATEOP malware in 2018
Changes in targeting may reflect tactical shifts in collection requirements.
	• In late 2021, APT43 resumed credential harvesting campaigns against religious groups, universities, and non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs), providing some indication that these campaigns were targeting "track two" diplomatic channels between North 
Korea and counterparts in South Korea and Japan. Notably, the activity represented a return to a primary focus on espionage targeting 
after a temporary focus on COVID-19 related organizations.
	• In early 2022, Mandiant Intelligence observed multiple credential collection campaigns targeting academics, journalists, politicians, 
bloggers, and other private sector individuals, primarily in South Korea.
	• By mid-2022, credential theft campaigns shifted to targeting South Korean bloggers and social media users associated with South 
Korean affairs, human rights, academia, religion, and cryptocurrency.

Cryptocurrency Targeting
APT43 has targeted cryptocurrency and cryptocurrency-related 
services. In contrast to other North Korean groups such as APT38, 
which are likely primarily tasked to bring in funds for the regime, 
APT43 most likely carries out such operations to sustain its own 
operations. 
	• We have identified APT43 using cryptocurrency services 
to launder stolen currency. Associated activity included 
identified payment methods, aliases, and addresses used for 
purchases (Figure 5), and the likely use of hash rental and cloud 
mining services to launder stolen cryptocurrency into clean 
cryptocurrency.
	– For a fee, these hash rental and cloud mining services 
provide hash power, which is used to mine cryptocurrency to 
a wallet selected by the buyer without any blockchain-based 
association to the buyer’s original payments.
	– Several payment methods were used for infrastructure and 
hardware purchases including PayPal, American Express 
cards, and Bitcoin likely derived from previous operations.
	• APT43 used a malicious Android app to most likely target 
Chinese users looking for cryptocurrency loans. The app and 
an associated domain probably harvested credentials, as 
depicted in Figure 6. 




















	• The prevalence of financially-motivated activity among North 
Korean groups, even among those which have historically 
focused on cyber espionage, suggests a widespread mandate 
to self-fund and an expectation to sustain themselves without 
additional resourcing.

Attribution
We assess with high confidence that APT43 is a state-sponsored 
cyber operator that acts in support of the North Korean 
government’s wider geopolitical aims.
	• The group’s targeting is consistent with North Korea’s 
shifting interests, although its dominant activity is to collect 
intelligence on the country’s primary rival: South Korea.
	– By extension, the United States’ support of South Korea also 
makes it a priority target.
	• APT43 has shared infrastructure and tools with known North 
Korean operators, highlighting its role and mission alignment 
in a wider state-sponsored cyber apparatus.
More specifically, Mandiant assesses with moderate confidence 
that APT43 is attributable to the North Korean Reconnaissance 
General Bureau (RGB), the country’s primary foreign intelligence 
service.
	• Elements of APT43 have been identified cooperating with 
other RGB-linked cyber espionage operators, namely TEMP.
Hermit (e.g. UNC1758). This is detailed further in the next 
section.

M A N D I A N T  APT43: North Korean Group Uses Cybercrime to Fund Espionage Operations
APT43 operations have at times, overlapped with those of other 
North Korean cyber espionage operators. However, we assess 
these groups to be distinct and separate and, believe the 
overlaps are likely the result of ad hoc collaborations or other 
limited resource sharing. These overlaps principally take the 
form of malware families that had historically been used by a 
single North Korean cluster being employed by additional actors.
	• APT43 employed malware first associated with suspected 
TEMP.Hermit clusters (often publicly reported as “Lazarus”) 
during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although this 
demonstrated some shared resources between APT43 
and TEMP.Hermit clusters, we assess that these links were 
temporary (Figure 7).
	– Specifically, such activities included campaigns targeting 
global organizations involved in COVID-19 response. In some 
of these operations, a subset of APT43 almost certainly 
worked closely with other RGB-linked units, including sharing 
existing malware tools, developing new tools initially used in 
the expanded tasking, and carrying out sustained campaigns 
against healthcare research and related organizations. 
	· Distinct tools derived from APT43 malware—such as the 
downloader PENCILDOWN—for use in these campaigns 
included PENDOWN, VENOMBITE, and EGGHATCH (also all 
downloaders, see Figure 7). 
	· These tools were used alongside core APT43 tooling such 
as LOGCABIN and LATEOP. 
	· APT43's use of malware variants such as HANGMAN.V2, a 
derivative of the HANGMAN backdoor usually linked with 
TEMP.Hermit, suggests some level of cross-pollination 
occurred during coordinated operations in 2020. 
	• These apparent cross-group operations were publicly reported 
as “Bureau 325” and also matched activity reported as “Cerium”. 
	• Additional uncategorized clusters have been identified 
leveraging some of the same tools as APT43. A cluster using 
PENCILDOWN, for example, compromised an Android mobile 
wallet app to steal cryptocurrency.
	• Conversely, in a separate instance we observed APT43 
deploying LONEJOGGER, a tool strongly associated with 
UNC1069 cryptocurrency targeting. 
	– UNC1069 is a suspected North Korean cybercrime operation 
with low confidence links to APT38.
Open sources often include additional operations in public 
reporting on “Kimsuky” activity. However, Mandiant continues to 
track these separately, especially those that leverage malware 
families such as KONNI and related tools CABRIDE and 
PLANEPATCH. Although these clusters of activity have overlaps 
with APT43, we believe that these links are tenuous and are the 
work of a separate group.

Malware
APT43 relies on a relatively large toolkit composed of both non-public malware and widely available tools. Most open source reporting on 
APT43 tracks the group using LATEOP (known publicly as “BabyShark”), but we have observed a steady evolution and expansion of the 
operation’s malware library over time. Some of the tools borrow code heavily from preceding tools (Figure 8), implementing improvements 
and adding features.
	• The group has deployed publicly available malware including gh0st RAT, QUASARRAT, and AMADEY, but its activities are much better 
known for being associated with LATEOP, a backdoor based on VisualBasic scripts. 
	• APT43 has developed different variants of some of their tools, enabling multi-platform targeting. For example, we have identified an 
Android variant of PENCILDOWN, a Windows-based downloader.

Outlook and Implications
Barring a drastic change in North Korea’s national priorities, we expect that APT43 will remain highly prolific in carrying out espionage 
campaigns and financially-motivated activities supporting these interests. We believe North Korea has become increasingly dependent 
on its cyber capabilities and, APT43’s persistent and continuously-developing operations reflect the country’s sustained investment and 
reliance on groups like APT43.
As demonstrated by the group’s sudden but temporary shift towards healthcare and pharmaceutical-related targeting, APT43 is highly 
responsive to the demands of Pyongyang’s leadership. Although spear-phishing and credential collection against government, military, 
and diplomatic organizations have been core taskings for the group, APT43 ultimately modifies its targeting and tactics, techniques and 
procedures to suit its sponsors, including carrying out financially-motivated cybercrime as needed to support the regime.
