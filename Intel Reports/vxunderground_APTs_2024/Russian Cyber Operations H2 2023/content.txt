TLP:CLEAR
The protracted conflict in Ukraine has served as a catalyst for 
the rapid advancement of Russian cyber capabilities. Over the 
past two years, we’ve observed a surge in activity by well-es-
tablished Russian APT groups, coupled with the emergence 
of new actors and specialized skill sets. This dynamic threat 
landscape underscores the evolving nature of Russian cy-
berwarfare, with a focus on leveraging these capabilities for 
multifaceted objectives.
Key Observations:
■ Enhanced Capabilities: Last 2 years accelerated the devel-
opment of Russian cyberwarfare tactics and techniques. 
Their APT groups exhibit increased sophistication, sug-
gesting the recruitment and integration of new talent.
■ Expanding Threat Landscape: The emergence of new 
actors suggests a deliberate strategy by Russia to di-
versify its cyberwarfare arsenal. These groups may pos-
sess unique skill sets or specialize in specific operational 
objectives.
■ Intelligence Gathering and Amplification: Russian cyber 
operations extend beyond traditional disruption. There’s 
a clear focus on utilizing cyber tools for intelligence gath-
ering in support of traditional military operations (kinet-
ic, psychological, and effects-based). This convergence 
further amplifies the impact of both cyber and physical 
warfare tactics.
This escalating cyber threat necessitates a heightened state 
of vigilance and a proactive approach to defense. Collabora-
tive efforts among security researchers, industry leaders, and 
governments are essential to effectively mitigate the risks 
posed by Russia’s evolving cyberwarfare capabilities.

We have observed definitive shifts in the behavior and objec-
tives of the most active APTs. Since the start of the second 
half of 2023, the attributed activity of known military actors 
has significantly decreased, while new, previously unidenti-
fied groups have emerged, utilizing novel and effective tech-
niques and procedures. 
Their origins and participants will still need to be determined, 
but previous experience and victimology suggests that they 
are also part of the Russian military machine or are informally 
funded and coordinated from Russian state command centers. 
We are witnessing the emergence of a new breed of adver-
saries employing innovative tactics and shaping a novel vision 
for cyber operations. These sophisticated actors pose signif-
icant challenges that demand our attention and proactive 
measures to safeguard the digital realm.
The ongoing war in Ukraine has served as a stark reminder 
of the ever-increasing sophistication and frequency of cyber 
operations during all kinds of conflicts. We have observed a 
surge in targeted attacks, many of which exhibit heightened 
technical complexity. Some Russian operations were bright 
and effective as destruction, but total fiasco in planning and 
from a long term perspective. This underscores the critical 
need to bolster our cybersecurity posture, share experience, 
cases, enhance collaboration, and foster a robust exchange of 
information and technologies among partners. The H2’2023 
served as a stark reminder of the critical need to prioritize the 
cybersecurity of Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and Tele-
communication companies. While ISPs and Telcos invest in 
security solutions, complacency can set in, leading to a fail-
ure to adapt to the ever-evolving tactics of national threat 
actors. This creates a gap in defenses that APTs can exploit, 
potentially causing widespread disruption and compromising 
national security.
Ukraine, unfortunately, has become a testing ground for the 
latest cyber weaponry, highlighting the urgency of collective 
action. The knowledge and skills gained from this confron-
tation will prove invaluable in shaping our future defense 
strategies.

TLP:CLEAR
Shifting Targets and No Immunity: While the first 
half of 2023 saw a focus on exploiting zero-day vul-
nerabilities in popular client-end software (e.g. Mic-
rosoft Outlook) by GRU-linked actors, H2 witnessed 
a surge in attacks against well-prepared telecom-
munications providers (with all their budgets and 
manpower), highlighting their critical role in the 
digital infrastructure, readiness and recoverability 
testing. 
Continuous Improvement: Security strategies and 
defenses must undergo continuous evaluation and 
improvement to stay ahead of emerging threats.
Evolving Tactics: Attackers are increasingly employ-
ing N-day exploits, known vulnerabilities for which 
patches have been released but not yet widely ad-
opted. Additionally, the use of mobile implants, ma-
licious software embedded on mobile devices, has 
increased.
Emergence of New Actors: New military focused 
APTs and criminal organizations previously unde-
tected are now dominating the cyber threat land-
scape in Ukraine, demonstrating the ever-changing 
nature of cyber threats and rise of Russian cyber 
capital.
*0-day exploits advantage 
of unknown vulnerabilities 
which are highly valuable to 
attackers because they can 
be used to infiltrate systems 
undetected. They are often 
sold on the black market 
or used by cyber attackers 
before the vendor becomes 
aware of the vulnerability 
and fixes it. Once a 0-day 
exploit is disclosed or 
detected, it becomes a known 
vulnerability, and the race 
begins to patch the affected 
systems before widespread 
damage can occur.
**An N-day exploit leverage 
vulnerability which is a known 
security weakness that may 
or may not be widely patched 
yet.

Targeting Telecommunications Providers
ACTIVE USE OF THE LATEST 
EXPLOITS AS CYBER WEAPONS
More active use of the latest vulnerabilities 
in client-side software (client-side attacks) 
for the purpose of hidden access and

NEW GROUPS DOMINATE OVERALL 
STATISTICS
The ranking of the most active threat actors 
has been topped by groups currently not 
associated with the special services of the 
aggressor country (although they operate 
in the interests of the Russian authorities). 
They distinguished themselves by using well-
thought-out phishing attacks, the main goal of 
which is to distribute malicious remote control 
software (RemcosRAT, RemoteUtilities) or data 
theft programs (LumaStealer, MeduzaStealer).
SURGE IN ACTIVITY FROM 
FINANCIALLY MOTIVATED 
CYBERCRIME GROUPS
We are witnessing an increase in activity 
from financially motivated cybercrime 
groups targeting Ukrainian businesses and 
organizations. In the second half of 2023, 
approximately 40% of registered incidents 
were related to financial theft. For 
instance, the UAC-0006 group resumed its 
operations in May 2023, and the number of 
incidents associated with their activities 
grew to 200 in the second half of the year.
TARGETED CYBER ESPIONAGE 
OPERATIONS  AGAINST UKRAINE 
DEFENSE FORCES (UAF)
Attacks aimed at gaining access, control, 
and extracting intelligence from specialized 
battlefield control systems are a strategic 
military objective of the adversary. To gain 
access and compromise credentials for 
such systems, and to access military chats, 
hackers created and distributed fake versions 
of software, carried out attacks aimed at 
compromising messengers actively used by the 
military.
RAPID EXPLOITATION  
OF TRENDING TOPICS
A high operational tempo of malware 
propagation leveraging current news 
events, such as Ukraine's NATO membership 
bid or IDF recruitment (during the onset of 
the Israeli military conflict).Threat actors are 
demonstrating a keen ability to capitalize on 
topical events to heighten the effectiveness 
of their cyberattacks. By aligning their 
attacks with trending narratives, they 
can exploit the increased attention and 
potential complacency of targets.
KEY INSIGHTS H2 2023:
Automation and Speed: Attackers are increasingly 
leveraging automation to accelerate their infiltra-
tion and control of critical IT systems. The APT28 
group is a prime example of this trend. 
Threat Intelligence Sharing: Sharing threat intelli-
gence and best practices can significantly enhance 
collective cybersecurity posture.
Collaborative Defense: Collaboration among organi-
zations, security researchers, and government agen-
cies is crucial to effectively combat cyber threats. 
We share this report to express our gratitude for all

CRITICAL AND HIGH SEVERITY CASES BY  
THREAT ACTORS IN H1’2023
However, for the completeness of the picture, it 
is necessary to understand who exactly caused 
real damage, carried out the most complex cyber 
operations. For this purpose, we selected those 
who fell into the segment of critical and high 
severity incidents and were attributed to well-
known groups:
Among the 80 cases with a critical and high severity 
of APTs with known attribution (+45 cases without 
attribution) in the second half of 2023, the military 
groups affiliated with GRU — are dominating — both 
old and newly UAC.
Dominance is not observed for a long period of one 
or another group, which indicates the approach to 
work in small groups. This, CERT-UA analysts believe, 
may indicate the competitiveness of Russian hacking 
groups in the implementation of Effect operations.

Sandworm (APT44) is a 
military group that has 
been operating against 
Ukrainian organizations 
since 2014. It is known for 
its attacks on Ukrainian 
energy distribution 
companies in 2015, which 
marked the first-ever 
wave of attacks on the 
country’s energy sector, 
as well as the NotPetya 
attack in 2017. The 
number of cyberattacks 
by Sandworm recorded 
in the second half of 2023 
increased by 2.5 times (18 
attacks in the first half of 
2023 versus 48 attacks in 
the second).
Attacks against ISPs  
and Telcos
F
rom late spring of 2023, the Russian military 
cyber command (GRU) tasked the Sandworm 
group, known for the NotPetya attack of 2017 
and attacks on energy facilities, along with 
other related units, to conduct acts of terrorism 
against Ukrainian telecommunications and internet 
companies. Sandworm, the most successful group 
active against Ukrainian entities since 2014, is noted 
for initiating the first wave of attacks on Ukraine’s 
energy sector in 2015. This group managed to qua-
druple the number of documented attacks from 14 
in 2022 to 62 in 2023.
From May 11 to September 29, 2023, a coordinated 
group of cybercriminals, tracked under the identifier 
UAC-0165, also disrupted the information and com-
munication systems of no fewer than 11 providers. 
This led to interruptions in internet access, hosting, 
and email services. A detailed description and tech-
nical information can be found at https://cert.gov.
ua/article/6123309. Even then, signs of a targeted 
campaign were evident, about which CERT-UA had 
previously warned telecommunications companies 
and providers. After a detailed analysis of the cyber 
incidents, a connection with the Sandworm threat 
cluster was established.

Moreover, Russia continues to employ hybrid attacks 
that combine cyber elements with missile strikes, 
aimed primarily at exacerbating the psychological 
impact on civilians. Their way to implement Effects 
Operations have multiple layers:
1.	 The effect itself
2.	The perception of the effect
3.	The psychological impact of the effect
With high certainty, the cyber attack on Kyivstar, 
Ukraine’s largest mobile operator serving 25 million 
subscribers, can be attributed to these hybrid attacks. 
This attack coincided with missile strikes that re-
sumed after a period of quiet. Please check the time-
line of missile attacks here:  https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Timeline_of_the_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine_
(1_December_2023_%E2%80%93_31_March_2024) 
On December 8, Russian military forces conducted 
a massive missile attack on	 Kyiv, launching 20 mis-
siles. Subsequently, on December 12, an attack was 
carried out on Kyivstar’s virtual network. The next 
day, December 13, as many of Kyivstar’s customers 
still experienced service disruptions, the aggressor 
launched an additional 10 missiles against Kyiv to 
intensify the «effect.»
We can conclude that the Effects operations against 
KyivStar was potentially useful in the context of

Military
D
uring the second half of 2023, a notable se-
ries of attempts to breach national military 
situational awareness systems utilized by the 
Security and Defense Forces of Ukraine were 
observed. Although less frequent, attacks on mobile 
devices and supply chains have increased signifi-
cantly in number over the year.
A particularly notable case involved a hacker group 
from the Russian military intelligence agency GRU, 
which deployed a mobile application mimicking 
the «DELTA» military app on Google Play before the 
Ukrainian Ministry of Defense could launch their of-
ficial version. Russian hackers promoted the down-
20
TLP:CLEAR
load of this deceptive application among Ukrainian 
military personnel and senior officers. Such opera-
tions indicate the GRU’s substantial reserve of devel-
opment and distribution resources, as well as their 
strategic planning capabilities, suggesting a signifi-
cant pool of developers actively engaged in various 
implantation and presence operations.
Additionally, we observed the distribution of an 
email urging updates to certificates within the 
“DELTA” system, utilizing a compromised email 
address from the Ukrainian defense ministry. The 
emails included PDF attachments mimicking legit-
imate ISTAR unit “Zaporizhzhia” digests, contain-
ing links to a malicious ZIP archive. Cybercriminals 
employed long-named domains and phishing sites 
to execute the infiltration, with the links appear-
ing legitimate upon cursor hover, e.g., hXXps://
delta.mil.gov.ua.delta-storages[.]com/certificates/
update, enhancing their effectiveness in deceiving 
the targets.

TLP:CLEAR
​T
he attention of Russian hackers to attacks 
on mobile devices is growing steadily. This 
is primarily due to the convenience of mes-
sengers for quick information exchange and 
their popularity, including among the military. The 
adversary is attracting more and more developers 
to provide and develop tools for remote retrieval of 
information from mobile devices.
This is a complex job that requires a special ap-
proach to a potential victim, so we often see cases 
of linking a specialized System Security Plan (SSP) 
to legitimate products.
In one of the cases of the second half of 2023, the 
Russian military intelligence agency disguised the 
open source code of the spy program for Android - 
SPYNOTE (SpyMax) - as the Nettle system installer. 
Unfortunately, we have to state that the main deliv-
ery channel outside of Google Play, which is blocked 
by the SPZ, remains social engineering during com-
munication via Signal and Telegram. In August 2023, 
the State Intelligence Service prepared and pub-
lished material on Signal’s security settings. There-
fore, we encourage you to familiarize yourself with 
it again (https://cip.gov.ua/ua/news/chi-zlamali-sig-
nal-ta-yak-ubezpechiti-sebe-vid-rizikiv) and disable 
the automatic download of files to your computer.
The same instruction began to be actively distrib-
uted through the Signal messenger between repre-
sentatives of the security and defense forces in the 
form of a PDF document, as it contained important 
security information. The adversary decided to use 
this material to implement his social engineering 
campaign. After 13 hours, the attackers began to 
distribute malicious software, allegedly on behalf of 
CERT-UA, under the guise of the same instructions.

TLP:CLEAR
The speed of reaction and exploitation of a new vec-
tor of infection, phishing and social engineering is 
particularly impressive. This observation also sup-
ports the hypothesis that there is a large amount of 
available human resources to implement such cam-
paigns «on the fly», since, as a rule, such attacks 
take much longer to plan and execute.
Virtually all targeted attacks through messengers 
aim to distribute SMPs for the Windows operating 
system, because their computer or web versions 
are often used for communication in messengers. 
Cases were recorded when attackers prepared and 
packaged fake software in the form of an update to a 
specialized complex of situational awareness on the 
battlefield. Bait files are often distributed as Zip or 
Rar archives. In particular, we detected the distribu-
tion of remote computer control malware contained 
in an archive exploiting a WinRAR vulnerability.

CONCLUSIONS  
AND FORECASTS
24
TLP:CLEAR
INCREASED FOCUS ON TARGETED COVERT CYBER 
RECONNAISSANCE OPERATIONS 
In 2024, information assets of security and defense 
sector organizations, as well as the individual 
computers and devices of their employees and 
officers, will be prime targets. Targeted social 
engineering is becoming an increasingly effective 
method for delivering malware to endpoints.
ENERGY FACILITIES AND CRITICAL CIVIL 
INFRASTRUCTURE TO REMAIN KEY FOCUS AREAS 
FOR HACKERS
As kinetic strikes on critical infrastructure increase, 
there will likely be a corresponding rise in malicious 
cyber activity by affiliated organizations seeking 
feedback on the impacts and outcomes of these 
strikes. Cybercriminal groups will explore new 
methods for penetrating networks of critical 
infrastructure, including through the compromise 
of service providers within these sectors. Software 
developers will be under special scrutiny.
INCREASE IN THE NUMBER AND COMPLEXITY OF 
FINANCIALLY MOTIVATED CYBER ATTACKS
There is an anticipated increase in cyber attacks 
aimed at financial theft. These attacks will primarily 
target the commercial sector and involve two main 
strategies: 
1) Infection and penetration of company networks 
to access banking credentials, and 
2) The use of ransomware to encrypt data and 
subsequently demand ransom for decryption.
