Turla APT Targets Albania With Backdooor in Ongoing
Campaign to Breach European Organizations
Prior to public reporting, infrastructure tied to the Russia-based Turla APT group was present in an
organization possibly located in Albania.
File: 7aa5a936a67cf367c0f1e0a22f3290ae57d8af01679daa811bb975c2978ca8a3 contains IP address
91[.]193[.]18[.]120, which is a key indicator of compromise recently described by Cisco Talos as a
command and control server used in parallel with the “TinyTurla-NG” (TTNG) backdoor. The file was
uploaded manually to the VirusTotal web interface by a user located in Albania, dated March 26.  
Analysis reveals the file is indeed a list of IP addresses in a plain text file. It is named
“Firewall_Bllok_IP.txt.txt”. Every IP address within is currently listed as malicious, and all but one IP
address are registered on multiple Antivirus vendors. The file has no further OSINT links, further
suggesting authenticity.

Figure 2 – Unique file uploaded manually from Albania-based 

IP address on March 26 to the VirusTotal user web interface 

with ”bllok”(block) written in Albanian.
The upload time falls within two Cisco reports regarding Tiny Turla activity, [1, 2] but prior to IP address
91[.]193[.]18[.]120 being made public. The targeting of Albania aligns with the regional interests of the
APT campaign first described mid-February. This new activity provides additional intelligence into the
possible scope of Russia-based APT operations, which has also included Poland in this campaign.

Baltic and Eastern European-based organizations with links to government are likely to continue to be
high-value targets for cyberattacks throughout 2024 as they provide espionage channels for APT groups
aligned to Russian interests in the broader context of the war in Ukraine.
