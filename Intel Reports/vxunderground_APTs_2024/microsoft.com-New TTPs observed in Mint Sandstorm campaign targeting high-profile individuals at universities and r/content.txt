New TTPs observed in Mint Sandstorm campaign targeting high-
profile individuals at universities and research orgs
⋮ 1/17/2024
By	Microsoft Threat Intelligence
Since November 2023, Microsoft has observed a distinct subset of Mint Sandstorm (PHOSPHORUS) targeting
high-profile individuals working on Middle Eastern affairs at universities and research organizations in Belgium,
France, Gaza, Israel, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In this campaign, Mint Sandstorm used
bespoke phishing lures in an attempt to socially engineer targets into downloading malicious files. In a handful of
cases, Microsoft observed new post-intrusion tradecraft including the use of a new, custom backdoor called
MediaPl.
Operators associated with this subgroup of Mint Sandstorm are patient and highly skilled social engineers whose
tradecraft lacks many of the hallmarks that allow users to quickly identify phishing emails. In some instances of
this campaign, this subgroup also used legitimate but compromised accounts to send phishing lures. Additionally,
Mint Sandstorm continues to improve and modify the tooling used in targets’ environments, activity that might
help the group persist in a compromised environment and better evade detection.
Mint Sandstorm (which overlaps with the threat actor tracked by other researchers as APT35 and Charming
Kitten) is a composite name used to describe several subgroups of activity with ties to the Islamic Revolutionary
Guard Corps (IRGC), an intelligence arm of Iran’s military. Microsoft attributes the activity detailed in this blog to a
technically and operationally mature subgroup of Mint Sandstorm that specializes in gaining access to and
stealing sensitive information from high-value targets. This group is known to conduct resource-intensive social
2/6
engineering campaigns that target journalists, researchers, professors, or other individuals with insights or
perspective on security and policy issues of interest to Tehran.
These individuals, who work with or who have the potential to influence the intelligence and policy communities,
are attractive targets for adversaries seeking to collect intelligence for the states that sponsor their activity, such
as the Islamic Republic of Iran. Based on the identities of the targets observed in this campaign and the use of
lures related to the Israel-Hamas war, it’s possible this campaign is an attempt to gather perspectives on events
related to the war from individuals across the ideological spectrum.
In this blog, we share our analysis of the new Mint Sandstorm tradecraft and provide detection, hunting, and
protection information. Organizations can also use the mitigations included in this blog to harden their attack
surfaces against the tradecraft observed in this and other Mint Sandstorm campaigns. These mitigations are high-
value measures that are effective ways to defend organizations from multiple threats, including Mint Sandstorm,
and are useful to any organization regardless of their threat model.
New Mint Sandstorm tradecraft
Microsoft observed new tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) in this Mint Sandstorm campaign, notably the
use of legitimate but compromised email accounts to send phishing lures, use of the Client for URL (curl)
command to connect to Mint Sandstorm’s command-and-control (C2) server and download malicious files, and
delivery of a new custom backdoor, MediaPl.
Social engineering
In this campaign, Mint Sandstorm masqueraded as high-profile individuals including as a journalist at a reputable
news outlet. In some cases, the threat actor used an email address spoofed to resemble a personal email
account belonging to the journalist they sought to impersonate and sent benign emails to targets requesting their
input on an article about the Israel-Hamas war. In other cases, Mint Sandstorm used legitimate but compromised
email accounts belonging to the individuals they sought to impersonate. Initial email messages did not contain
any malicious content.
This tradecraft, namely the impersonation of a known individual, the use of highly bespoke phishing lures, and the
use of wholly benign messages in the initial stages of the campaign, is likely an attempt to build rapport with
targets and establish a level of trust before attempting to deliver malicious content to targets. Additionally, it’s
likely that the use of legitimate but compromised email accounts, observed in a subset of this campaign, further
bolstered Mint Sandstorm’s credibility, and might have played a role in the success of this campaign.
Delivery
If targets agreed to review the article or document referenced in the initial email, Mint Sandstorm followed up with
an email containing a link to a malicious domain. In this campaign, follow up messages directed targets to sites
such as cloud-document-edit[.]onrender[.]com, a domain hosting a RAR archive (.rar) file that purported to
contain the draft document targets were asked to review. If opened, this .rar file decompressed into a double
extension file (.pdf.lnk) with the same name. When launched, the .pdf.lnk file ran a curl command to retrieve a
series of malicious files from attacker-controlled subdomains of glitch[.]me and supabase[.]co.
Microsoft observed multiple files downloaded to targets’ devices in this campaign, notably several .vbs scripts. In
several instances, Microsoft observed a renamed version of NirCmd, a legitimate command line tool that allows a
user to carry out a number of actions on a device without displaying a user interface, on a target’s device.
Persistence
3/6
In some cases, the threat actor used a malicious file, Persistence.vbs, to persist in targets’ environments. When
run, Persistence.vbs added a file, typically named a.vbs, to the CurrentVersion\Run registry key. In other cases,
Mint Sandstorm created a scheduled task to reach out to an attacker-controlled supabase[.]co domain and
download a .txt file.

Collection
Activity observed in this campaign suggests that Mint Sandstorm wrote activity from targets’ devices to a series of
text files, notably one named documentLoger.txt.
In addition to the activity detailed above, in some cases, Mint Sandstorm dropped MischiefTut or MediaPl, custom
backdoors.
MediaPl backdoor
MediaPl is a custom backdoor capable of sending encrypted communications to its C2 server. MediaPl is
configured to masquerade as Windows Media Player, an application used to store and play audio and video files.
To this end, Mint Sandstorm typically drops this file in C:\\Users\\[REDACTED] \\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Media
Player\\MediaPl.dll. When MediaPl.dll is run with the path of an image file provided as an argument, it launches
the image in Windows Photo application and also parses the image for C2 information. Communications to and
from MediaPl’s C2 server are AES CBC encrypted and Base64 encoded. As of this writing, MediaPl can
terminate itself, can pause and retry communications with its C2 server, and launch command(s) it has received
from the C2 using the _popen function.
MischiefTut
MischiefTut is a custom backdoor implemented in PowerShell with a set of basic capabilities. MischiefTut can run
reconnaissance commands, write outputs to a text file and, ostensibly, send outputs back to adversary-controlled
infrastructure. MischiefTut can also be used to download additional tools on a compromised system.
Implications
The ability to obtain and maintain remote access to a target’s system can enable Mint Sandstorm to conduct a
range of activities that can adversely impact the confidentiality of a system. Compromise of a targeted system can

also create legal and reputational risks for organizations affected by this campaign. In light of the patience,
resources, and skills observed in campaigns attributed to this subgroup of Mint Sandstorm, Microsoft continues to
update and augment our detection capabilities to help customers defend against this threat.
Recommendations
Microsoft recommends the following mitigations to reduce the impact of activity associated with recent Mint
Sandstorm campaigns.
Use the Attack Simulator in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 to organize realistic, yet safe, simulated
phishing and password attack campaigns in your organization by training end-users against clicking URLs
in unsolicited messages and disclosing their credentials. Training should include checking for poor spelling
and grammar in phishing emails or the application’s consent screen as well as spoofed app names, logos
and domain URLs appearing to originate from legitimate applications or companies. Note that Attack
Simulator testing only supports phishing emails containing links at this time.
Encourage users to use Microsoft Edge and other web browsers that support SmartScreen, which identifies
and blocks malicious websites, including phishing sites, scam sites, and sites that contain exploits and host
malware. Turn on network protection to block connections to malicious domains and IP addresses.
Turn on cloud-delivered protection in Microsoft Defender Antivirus or the equivalent for your antivirus
product to cover rapidly evolving attacker tools and techniques. Cloud-based machine learning protections
block a majority of new and unknown variants.
Microsoft Defender XDR customers can also turn on attack surface reduction rules to harden their environments
against techniques used by this Mint Sandstorm subgroup. These rules, which can be configured by all Microsoft
Defender Antivirus customers and not just those using the EDR solution, offer significant protection against the
tradecraft discussed in this report.
Block executable files from running unless they meet a prevalence, age, or trusted list criterion.
Block JavaScript or VBScript from launching downloaded executable content.
Block execution of potentially obfuscated scripts.
