Mass spread of MarsStealer malicious program among citizens of Ukraine and domestic organizations
(CERT-UA # 4315)
general information
The Governmental Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine CERT-UA received information on
the mass distribution of e-mails on the topic "New program for journal entry." among citizens of Ukraine
and domestic organizations. The text of the e-mail allegedly contains a message from the Ministry of
Education and Science of Ukraine regarding "electronic educational journals", as well as a link to the
"program" and the password to the archive.
If you open the archive and run the EXE file, the computer will be affected by malware, which, due to a
combination of features (despite some differences), is classified as MarsStealer.
MarsStelaer is a malware programmer developed using C / ASM programming languages. The main
functionality is collecting information about the computer, stealing authentication data from Internet
browsers, crypto-wallet plug-ins, multi-factor authentication programs, stealing files, as well as
downloading and running executable files and taking a screenshot.
The malware is sold on thematic forums. Probably, after the suspension of sales of the Racoon styler, it
will be used as an alternative. Note that the claimed functionality, which avoids the use of the styler in
relation to the "CIS countries", is disabled by patching calls to the appropriate functions.
Detected activity is tracked by UAC-0041 as an activity of one of the groups aimed at stealing user
credentials.
