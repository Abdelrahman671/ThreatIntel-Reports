Executive Summary
Unit 42 has identified malicious Chinese APT infrastructure masquerading as cloud backup services. Monitoring
telemetry associated with two prominent Chinese APT groups, we observed network connections predominately
originating from the country of Cambodia, including inbound connections originating from at least 24 Cambodian
government organizations.
We assess with high confidence that these Cambodian government entities were targeted and remain compromised
by Chinese APT actors. This assessment is due to the malicious nature and ownership of the infrastructure combined
with persistent connections over a period of several months.
Cambodia and China maintain strong diplomatic and economic ties. Since Cambodia signed on to China’s Belt and
Road Initiative (BRI) in 2013, the relationship between these two countries has grown steadily.
In recent years, China’s most notable investment has been a project to modernize Cambodia's Ream Naval Base.
This project generated controversy and drew scrutiny from several Western nations due to initial attempts by both
countries to conceal the project.
As the project nears completion this year, the naval base is on track to become China’s first overseas outpost in
Southeast Asia. As such, this project demonstrates how significant Cambodia is to China’s ambitions of projecting
power and expanding naval operations in the region.
Palo Alto Networks customers receive protection from this malicious infrastructure through our Next-Generation
Firewall with Cloud-Delivered Security Services, including DNS Security and Advanced URL Filtering.

Infrastructure Overview
Unit 42 identified infrastructure associated with the following known malicious SSL certificate:
Subject Full Name C=US,ST=Some-State,O=Internet Widgits Pty Ltd,CN=10.200.206.100
Issuer Full Name

Table 1. SSL Certificate Overview.
Most recently, this certificate was used by servers on six target-facing IP addresses. Each of these servers host
several subdomains associated with six domains.
Based on their names, a number of these domains appear to masquerade as cloud storage services. This disguise
likely lends a sense of legitimacy to the unusual amount of traffic during times of high activity levels from the actor,
such as data exfiltration from the victim network.
Figure 1 provides a visualization of the malicious infrastructure.

Figure 1. Infrastructure overview.
Suspected Cambodian Government Targets
We observed a total of 24 Cambodian government organizations regularly communicating with this infrastructure
between September and October 2023. A number of these organizations provide critical services in the following
industries:
National defense
Election oversight
Human rights
National treasury and finance
Commerce
Politics
Natural resources
Telecommunications
These targets all hold vast amounts of sensitive data, including the following:
Financial data
Personally identifiable information of citizens
Classified government information
We assess that these organizations are likely the targets of long-term cyberespionage activities that have leveraged
this infrastructure for persistent access to government networks of interest.

Command and Control Infrastructure
We assess with high confidence that the target-facing IP addresses are being used as command and control (C2)
infrastructure by the threat actor. We believe the infrastructure is running the Cowrie honeypot on port 2222. The
attackers are likely using this honeypot as a cover to deceive network defenders and researchers investigating
anomalous activity.
We have also observed IP filtering on this infrastructure. Specifically, we have observed the blocking of connections
from the following:
Known Palo Alto Networks IP ranges
Some VPS and cloud hosting providers
IP ranges from a number of Big Tech and other cybersecurity companies
We believe this threat actor is filtering connections to the malicious infrastructure to minimize the risk of the C2s being
profiled by IP scanners or identified by cybersecurity researchers.
We have also observed C2 ports open during activity times for the threat actor and closed at all other times. Again,
this is likely to minimize the risk of the infrastructure being profiled by IP scanners or identified by researchers.
Table 2 outlines the known actor and target-facing ports.

Table 2. Target-facing infrastructure details.
Actor Pattern of Life
While investigating the cluster of infrastructure, we were able to determine the actor’s pattern of life. We
predominantly observed the actor’s activity between 08:30 and 17:30 UTC +08:00 (China Standard Time) on
weekdays (Monday to Friday). This pattern might indicate the actor is attempting to avoid detection by blending into
regular Cambodian business hours which are UTC +07:00.
However, we also observed a significant change in actor activity that suggests the actor is based in China and
working regular business hours in China.
This change in the actor’s pattern of life occurred between Sep. 29 and Oct. 8, 2023. Actor activity ceased on Sep.
29, with low amounts of activity through the week of Oct. 2-8, including the weekend of Oct. 7-8. We saw actor
5/6
activity return to regular levels and patterns starting Oct. 9.
The dates of the actor’s activity changes align with China’s Golden Week, held on Sep. 29 to Oct. 6, 2023, and
“Special Working Days,” designated as Oct. 7-8, 2023. Special Working Days are Chinese government-mandated
working days to compensate for the extended holiday.
Figure 2 shows the regular activity pattern and deviation during Golden Week, before returning to normal.

Conclusion
Unit 42 identified Chinese APT-associated activity targeting Cambodia, including over 20 Cambodian government
organizations across a range of key industries. This activity is believed to be part of a long-term espionage campaign.
The observed activity aligns with geopolitical goals of the Chinese government as it seeks to leverage their strong
relations with Cambodia to project their power and expand their naval operations in the region. We encourage all
organizations to leverage our findings to inform the deployment of protective measures to defend against this activity.
Protection Recommendations
To defend against the threats described in this blog, Palo Alto Networks recommends organizations employ the
following capabilities:
Network Security: Delivered through a Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW) configured with machine learning
enabled and cloud-delivered security services. This includes threat prevention, URL filtering, DNS security and
a malware prevention engine capable of identifying and blocking malicious samples and infrastructure.
Security Automation: Delivered through a Cortex XSOAR or XSIAM solution capable of providing SOC analysts
with a comprehensive understanding of the threat derived by stitching together data obtained from endpoints,
network, cloud and identity systems.
Container Security: Delivered through the Palo Alto Networks Prisma Cloud advanced container security
features for container runtime environments to ensure detection and prevention of known malicious
executables. Advanced URL Filtering blocks malicious IoCs related to this operation. WildFire integration for
cloud-delivered malware analysis service accurately identifies known samples as malicious.
Protections and Mitigations
Palo Alto Networks customers receive protection from the threats discussed above through the following products:
Advanced URL Filtering blocks web requests to malicious URLs
