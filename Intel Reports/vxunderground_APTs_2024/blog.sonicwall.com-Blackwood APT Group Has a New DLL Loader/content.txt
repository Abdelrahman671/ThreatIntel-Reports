Blackwood APT Group Has a New DLL Loader
Security News ⋮ ⋮ 1/29/2024
Overview
This week, the SonicWall Capture Labs threat research team analyzed a sample tied to the Blackwood
APT group. This is a DLL that, when loaded onto a victim’s computer, will escalate privileges and attempt
to install a backdoor for communications monitoring and diversion. It has evasive capabilities and, as of
this writing, is targeting companies and individuals in Japan and China.
Technical Overview
The sample is detected as a 32-bit DLL (Figure 1) with no packer or protector. It has minimal strings and
no obvious obfuscation or encryption.

Strings show several API calls of concern, including GetCurrentProcessID, OpenProcess and VirtualAlloc
– all of which are used to load malicious DLLs into memory. There are also two files listed:
‘333333333333333.txt’ and ‘Update.ini’, as shown in Figure 2.

The name of the file is shown as ‘agent.dll’ (Figure 3) and there is one anonymous export that is only
shown as an ordinal value when looking at the file with multiple tools.

When dynamically analyzing the sample, it has multiple anti-analysis capabilities that prevent most of its
function from being observed. It will look for debuggers, processor features and security settings in the
registry (Figure 3). There are also locale checks that, when failed, will kill the process.

The anonymous export at address 0x10001A70 is the file calling ‘Rundll32.exe’ for process injection, as
shown in Figure 5.
Figure 5: Export address calls sub_10001990, which creates ‘rundll32.exe’
Controlling the program’s execution allows the check for a UAC bypass to be generated. The DLL will
attempt to escalate privileges via CMSTPLUA interface[1]. The following strings are created, as shown in
Figures 5 and 6:
Elevation:Administrator!new:{FCC74B77-EC3E-4DD8-A80B-008A702075A9}
Elevation:Administrator!new:{F885120E-3789-4FD9-865E-DC9B4A6412D2}

The two files that are listed within the strings are also referenced during runtime (Figure 7), but despite
multiple attempts at controlling execution, the files were not observed on test systems.
