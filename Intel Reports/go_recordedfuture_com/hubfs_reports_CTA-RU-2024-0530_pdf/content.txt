Executive Summary
As Russia’s war against Ukraine persists, Russia is applying all of its resources to gain a strategic
advantage. Over the past year, Insikt Group has tracked the evolution of BlueDelta’s operational
infrastructure, which was used to deploy its information-stealing malware Headlace in three distinct
phases between April and December 2023. This activity overlaps with activity previously attributed by
Insikt Group, the Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA), and others to APT28 or
Fancy Bear, which we attribute to the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the
Russian Federation (GRU).
Throughout the three phases, BlueDelta used phishing emails, legitimate internet services (LIS), and
living off-the-land binaries (LOLBins) to extract intelligence from key networks across Europe. They
have engaged in credential harvesting campaigns aimed at Yahoo and UKR[.]net users, as well as
dedicated victim mail servers. BlueDelta’s recent operations have targeted the Ukrainian Ministry of
Defence, Ukrainian weapons import and export companies, European railway infrastructure enterprises,
and a think tank based in Azerbaijan.
BlueDelta's espionage activities reflect a broader strategy aimed at gathering intelligence on entities
with military significance to Russia in the context of its ongoing aggression against Ukraine. This focus
is consistent with their objective to uncover operational capabilities and potential vulnerabilities within
Ukraine's defense sector. Additionally, BlueDelta’s attention to institutions such as the Azerbaijan
Center for Economic and Social Development think tank extends this strategy, aiming to collect
intelligence on regional strategic policies and developments.
BlueDelta’s tactics, which primarily involve credential capture for initial access, are engineered to mimic
regular network traffic, making detection difficult. Some of BlueDelta’s credential harvesting pages can
bypass two-factor authentication by relaying requests between legitimate services and compromised
Ubiquiti routers, increasing their effectiveness. The abuse of LIS, such as GitHub, to host redirection
scripts also complicates the identification of malicious activity. Throughout these campaigns, BlueDelta
has continuously refined its operations, demonstrating notable sophistication and adaptability.
Critical sectors targeted by BlueDelta, including government, military, defense, energy, transportation,
and think tanks, must bolster their awareness and defenses against these tactics. Security training
should prioritize identifying characteristics of BlueDelta’s phishing emails, which are highlighted in Insikt
Group reporting. We recommend restricting access to non-essential free services often exploited by
BlueDelta and highlighted in this report. Organizations using targeted email services like Yahoo and
UKR[.]net should implement strict security measures, including two-factor authentication and close
monitoring for suspicious activity.

BlueDelta uses credential harvesting pages that can defeat two-factor authentication and
CAPTCHA challenges by relaying requests between legitimate services and compromised
Ubiquiti routers.
●
Recorded Future customers should turn on real-time alerting through Recorded Future’s
Intelligence Cloud to detect typosquat domains that mimic their brands, assess suspicious email
attachments with Recorded Future Malware Intelligence, and monitor their companies’ attack
surface by using Recorded Future’s Attack Surface Intelligence.
Background
On September 4, 2023, CERT-UA reported a phishing campaign that leveraged Headlace malware to
target a critical energy infrastructure facility in Ukraine. During this campaign, BlueDelta sent phishing
emails from a fake sender address that contained links to archive files. The archive files contained lure
images and Windows BAT script, which, if executed, would result in the whoami command being run
and the results being exfiltrated back to the threat actor. On September 6, 2023, Zscaler published a
new blog post titled “Steal-It Campaign”. This report provided additional information covering several
new attack chains used by BlueDelta, which targeted entities in Australia, Belgium, and Poland.
In October 2023, Insikt Group shared an internal report on BlueDelta activity involving
living-off-the-land binaries and abuse of LIS to target European victims. During this campaign, three
separate infection chains were observed, which used geo-fencing techniques to exploit victims located
only in Austria, Lithuania, and Spain. The report detailed the threat actor's use of the free mock
application programming interface (API) services Mockbin (mockbin[.]org) and Mocky (mocky[.]io) to
survey Windows operating systems and capture NT LAN Manager (NTLM) hashes. BlueDelta used
seven different infrastructure stages, as shown in Figure 1, to filter out sandboxes and incompatible
operating systems and to restrict payloads to systems in targeted countries. Victims who failed these
checks downloaded a benign file and were redirected to Microsoft’s web portal, msn[.]com, whereas

those who passed downloaded a malicious Windows BAT script, which connected to one of the
aforementioned free API services to download and run follow-on shell commands.
In December 2023, Proofpoint and IBM published research on a new wave of BlueDelta spearphishing
using various lure content to deliver Headlace malware. The campaigns targeted at least thirteen
separate nations, as described in this report in phase three.

Analysis
Insikt Group has identified two new phases of BlueDelta activity in which the threat actors deployed
new tradecraft and infrastructure to evade detection and increase operational effectiveness.
Throughout these new phases, BlueDelta regularly used a free hosting service offered by InfinityFree.
InfinityFree provides free subdomains to complement its free hosting service for the following apex
domains:
●
*.rf[.]gd
●
*infinityfreeapp[.]com
●
*.000[.]pe
●
*.lovestoblog[.]com

Phase-One Infrastructure
As previously reported by Insikt Group, in phase one, BlueDelta redirected victims to the apex domains
*.lovestoblog[.]com and *.rf[.]gd at stage one of their attack sequence, as shown in Figure 1. BlueDelta
then moved to GitHub for redirection for phase two and *.infinityfreeapp[.]com and *.rf[.]gd for phase
three.
Throughout phases one to three, BlueDelta used Mocky, a free API hosting service, to host JavaScript
filtering and redirection code. The threat actors also used Mockbin, another free API hosting service, for
the first two phases, moving to PHP: Hypertext Processor (PHP) scripts hosted on InfinityFree in phase
three.
Phase-Two Infrastructure
Beginning September 28, 2023, BlueDelta deployed new first-stage redirection infrastructure to GitHub.
The threat actors created two new accounts, "microsoft-update-com” and “windows-update-service”,
as shown in Figure 2. The accounts each hosted a code repository called “kb5021042”, likely in an
attempt to impersonate the Microsoft Windows Update Service. The Microsoft Knowledge Base code
“kb5021042” corresponds to a Microsoft update version identifier issued for Windows 10 and Windows
Server 2019 in November 2022.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS | RUSSIA
Stage One
Each GitHub repository contained an identical HTML script titled update.html. As shown in Figure 3,
the scripts used similar code to the phase-one redirection scripts hosted on InfinityFree. The only
difference between the phases was the use of the URL constant id in phase two as opposed to the
URL constant q used in phase one. The URL constant id passes the globally unique identifier (GUID)
from the stage-one URL and is used in the address of the stage-two Mockbin request.
Figure 3: Source of HTTP redirection script hosted on GitHub (Source: Recorded Future)
When using the URL constant id in phase two, the full URLs would have been formatted as follows:
●
https://windows-update-service[.]github[.]io/kb5021042/update.html?id=[GUID]
●
https://microsoft-update-com[.]github[.]io/kb5021042/update.html?id=[GUID]
Stage Two
Following either of the stage-one links redirects the victim to the stage-two script hosted at Mockbin,
as shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4: Stage-two filtering script (Source: Recorded Future)
The stage-two Mockbin script differs slightly from the stage-two script BlueDelta used in phase one,
combining several previously used checks into one script.
The first function of the phase-two script remains unchanged and prevents automatic scraping or
sandboxes from moving to stage three. The second function in the script is new and checks the victim
user agent to capture what version of Chrome or Firefox browser they are running. It checks if this value
is an integer, and if not, returns false or 0 if Chrome or Firefox are not running on the victim system.
The third part of the script checks the victim’s user agent string to ensure they are running a 64-bit
version of Windows and checks the results of the first two functions. These determine whether the
script is being run in a sandbox, whether the browser is either Chrome or Firefox, and whether its
version is over 100. If these checks pass, the JavaScript then redirects the victim to stage three hosted
at Mocky; otherwise, the victim is redirected to msn[.]com.
Stage Three
The stage-three script hosted at Mocky remains unchanged from phase one. As shown in Figure 5, the
script uses the free geo-location API service ipapi, hosted on ipapi[.]co, to perform a geo-location
check to ensure the victim is located in the threat actor’s target country. The script also checks whether
the victim is running a Windows operating system and has an IPv4 IP address. If all checks pass, a
malicious archive file is downloaded via HTML smuggling; otherwise, a benign archive file is
downloaded, and the victim is redirected to msn[.]com. In phase two, most of the stage-three scripts
that were investigated were no longer accessible, but a sample that contained a geo-fencing restriction
for victims in Azerbaijan (AZ) was captured.

Stage Four
The stage-four ZIP payloads were essentially unchanged from the stage-four payloads detected in
phase one. The ZIP files contain a BAT script and a benign CAB file for the Windows Update
kb5021042. Upon execution, the BAT script creates a visual basic script (VBScript) and an additional
BAT script. The VBScript is then executed and calls the newly created BAT script. The only purpose of
VBScript is to execute the newly created BAT script.
When executed, the newly created BAT script displays a command prompt showing a fake installation of
a Windows Update, as shown in Figure 6. As per phase one (see Figure 1), the new BAT script runs in a
loop every five minutes (300 seconds) and downloads a third BAT script (stage six) via Mockbin and
Mocky, which masquerades as a CSS file and is run via Microsoft Edge in headless mode. The final
downloaded BAT script is then moved to the victim’s C:\ProgramData\ directory before being
executed and finally deleted.

Stage Five
The stage-five script, hosted on Mockbin, remains unchanged from phase one, as shown in Figure 7.
This script checks the victim’s user agent string to ensure it is running a 64-bit version of Windows and
whether its browser version is above 100. If the checks pass, the JavaScript redirects the victim to
stage six hosted on Mocky; if they fail, it redirects the victim to msn[.]com. The stage-five Mockbin URL
is also used to capture the results of stage-six commands, per Figure 1.
Figure 7: Stage-five Mocky redirection script (Source: Recorded Future)
Stage Six
At the time of investigation, the stage-six scripts hosted at Mocky were returning “404 Not Found”
HTTP responses, likely meaning these had been taken down and were not available for analysis. As per
phase one, this stage likely contained a second geo-fencing check that, if passed, allowed the victim to
download a CSS payload via HTML smuggling, which contained commands to be executed on the
victim's machine.
Stage Seven
Stage seven remains unchanged from phase one. The stage-five Mockbin URL is used to capture the
results of commands executed on the victim system, which are stored as API calls in Mockbin and
available to collect by BlueDelta.
Lure Documents and Malware
Insikt Group identified three separate ZIP files used in phase two, as shown in Table 1. The ZIP files
contained the first malicious BAT and benign CAB files and no further lure documents.

Phase-Three Infrastructure Updates
Beginning October 17, 2023, BlueDelta deployed new infrastructure, which improved several stages of
the previous two phases. BlueDelta moved away from hosting first-stage redirection scripts on GitHub
and instead used InfinityFree hosting. Additionally, the threat actors moved all operating system
filtering and geo-fencing scripts from HTML to PHP, meaning the code was no longer visible to security
researchers due to server-side execution. BlueDelta may have implemented this change to make their
infrastructure harder to detect and track, or it’s possible the threat actors wanted to move away from
the free API hosting service Mockbin, as the service temporarily halted its operations around the time
of the change while it updated its service. It’s also possible these changes were in response to public
reports exposing BlueDelta’s previous campaigns.
In phase three, a significant increase in targeting was observed, with 27 new first-stage domains and
eleven separate payloads uncovered, some of which were recently reported by Trend Micro. Most of
the domains seen in phase three followed a similar pattern to those used in the previous two phases,
where BlueDelta used a combination of hyphenated words. Some domains appeared to be file
downloads, such as file-download[.]infinityfreeapp[.]com. In some instances, the chosen domains
showed a lack of creativity by the threat actor, such as fdsagdfg[.]rf[.]gd, or were duplicate domains
with letters appended to the end, such as document-c[.]infinityfreeapp[.]com and
document-d[.]infinityfreeapp[.]com. The complete list of detected phase-three domains is shown in
Table 2.

Table 2: BlueDelta phase-three, stage-one, redirection domains (Source: Recorded Future)
Additionally, for phase three, the actors made slight changes to the infrastructure stages, combining
previous stages two and three into a single PHP script, as shown in Figure 8.
Figure 8: Phase-three infrastructure stages (Source: Recorded Future)
Stage One
Previously, in phase two, stage one, the actors used an HTML redirection script to forward victims to
Mockbin, as described in Figure 3.
In phase three, the redirection technique was modified to use the web server's root directory, which
forwarded victims to a new PHP script called filedwn.php. For example, *.infinityfreeapp[.]com/?id=
would redirect to *.infinityfreeapp[.]com/filedwn.php?id=.
Stage Two
In phase three, the aforementioned file filedwn.php replaced the previously used stages two and
three in the infection chain. Due to PHP being a server-side programming language, it is not possible to
see the actual code used, but it’s assumed that the malicious script carries out similar sandbox,
11
CTA-RU-2024-0530
Recorded Future® | www.recordedfuture.com
CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS | RUSSIA
browser, and geo-fencing checks as per the previous stages in phases one and two. If the victim fails
the checks, filedwn.php serves the victim a benign ZIP file and redirects them to msn[.]com; if they
pass, they receive a malicious ZIP. It is suspected that the threat actors may have added some sort of
count function limiting the number of times the malicious payload can be downloaded, as during our
research, it was noted that the payload could only be downloaded once, and subsequent requests
would receive the benign ZIP file.
Stage Three
The payload for stage three was changed slightly from the previous two phases. As shown In Figure 9,
one lure theme was “news_week_6” and when decompressed, the ZIP file contained a folder with an
executable called news_week_6 and hidden files named calc.cmd, WindowsCodecs.dll,
news_week_6, and news_week_6.docx.
Figure 9: Contents of the stage-four payload (Source: Recorded Future)
The news_week_6 executable file is a benign copy of calc.exe that loads WindowsCodecs.dll via
dynamic-link library (DLL) search order hijacking. Once loaded, the DLLMain function executes
calc.cmd via a call to system(), as shown in Figure 10. The news_week_6 executable file had several
spaces appended to the file name, which were probably added to hide the fact that it was an
executable file.

CTA-RU-2024-0530
Recorded Future® | www.recordedfuture.com
CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS | RUSSIA
Figure 10: WindowsCodec.dll used to execute cmd.cmd (Source: Recorded Future)
The calc.cmd script creates similar BAT and VBS files, as seen in phases one and two. It then launches
the decoy document news_week_6.docx, removes the malicious payload from the victim’s machine,
and replaces it with a copy of the benign payload news_week_6 file.
As shown in Figure 11, the first line of the calc.cmd script is the same as seen in the first two phases.
This creates a VBS script and another BAT script that repeatedly checks in with the
command-and-control (C2) for new payloads masquerading as CSS files. The calc.cmd script then
continues by killing any running instances of WINWORD.exe, removing the malicious artifacts from its
payload, copying the benign copy of its payload into the user’s download directory, and then opening
the decoy document.
Figure 11: calc.cmd script (Source: Recorded Future)
A minor change to the BAT script used to retrieve a new CSS payload was observed. When running
Microsoft Edge in headless mode, rather than using the URL for the C2, an encoded HTML page is
instead provided, as shown in Figure 12.

browser to an infinityfreeapp[.]com URL rather than Mockbin, as used in phases one and two.
Figure 13: Decoded HTML page used to redirect the victim to the C2 server (Source: Recorded Future)
Stage Four
The stage-four script, execdwn.php, was also changed to PHP from HTML and is hosted at InfinityFree
rather than Mockbin. The content of this script is not viewable, but it is expected to be similar to the
previous stage-five script containing JavaScript, as shown earlier in Figure 7. The script conducts
browser and operating system checks before forwarding the victim to a final payload hosted at Mocky,
which contains commands to be executed on the victim's system. As per the previous Mockbin file, this
stage is also used to capture the output of these commands after stage six for the actors to collect.
Stage Five
Several payload scripts were captured in this phase. The scripts remained the same as those found in
phase one and contained a second geo-fencing check that, if passed, allowed the victim to download a
malicious CSS payload via HTML smuggling, which contained commands to be run on the victim's
machine, as shown in Figure 14.

Stage Six
At stage six, BlueDelta sent the results of the commands run on the victim system to the PHP file
execdwn.php rather than Mockbin, as in phases one and two.
Phishing Emails and Lure Documents
Insikt Group uncovered one phishing email linked to BlueDelta’s phase-three campaign, as shown in
Figure 16. The email appeared to be sent from the Chancellery of the Prime Minister in Poland and used
a report on the human rights of Palestine and Arab-occupied territories as a lure. The email contained a
hyperlink to opendoc[.]infinityfreeapp[.]com, with the display text war.zip.

The last detected activity in phase three was in December 2023. Since then, BlueDelta likely ceased
using InfinityFree hosting and favored hosting infrastructure on webhook[.]site and mocky[.]io directly,
as explained in recent reporting by CERT Polska. Additionally, BlueDelta has started using the apex
domain firstcloudit[.]com, available from the free hosting company DriveHQ. As reported by IBM,
BlueDelta started using a new backdoor, MASEPIE, in November 2023, which overlaps slightly with the
last use of Headlace in phase three.
BlueDelta Credential Harvesting
While analyzing the LIS BlueDelta frequently abused, Insikt Group uncovered some recent credential
harvesting pages that were active in March 2024.
The credential harvesting pages can be attributed to BlueDelta because, in some instances,
compromised Ubiquiti Edge routers were used to capture credentials. The secure socket shell (SSH)
18

banners found on the Ubiquiti routers match the format of SSH banners recently highlighted in a report
by the FBI, NSA, US Cyber Command, and international partners that detailed BlueDelta's use of
Ubiquiti EdgeRouters for infrastructure.
In addition to using Ubiquiti EdgeRouters, some of the detected pages used the following free API and
hosting services alongside the InfinityFree apex domains mentioned at the beginning of the analysis
section of the report:
●
Webhook[.]site - webhook[.]site
●
Pipedream - pipedream[.]com
●
Mocky - mocky[.]io
●
Forge - getforge[.]com
BlueDelta used these free LIS for page- and code-hosting, credential capture, and exfiltration. As
shown in Table 4, eighteen pages that were active between March 2022 and March 2024 were
uncovered. Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) and Sekoia previously attributed some of the pages to
BlueDelta, as highlighted in Appendix A.

Table 4: BlueDelta credential harvesting pages and intended targets (Source: Recorded Future)
Several pages targeted Ukrainian news and webmail provider ukr[.]net users. A recent page hosted on
Mocky, which impersonates ukr[.]net, was detected in February 2024, as shown in Figure 19.
Figure 19: Credential harvesting page impersonating UKR.net (Source: Recorded Future)
The malicious ukr[.]net page uses JavaScript to exfiltrate credentials to a compromised Ubiquiti
EdgeRouter with IP address 73.80.9[.]137 via TCP port 35770, as shown in Figure 20. After the

credentials are submitted to the router from the harvesting page, the script waits for one of five
responses:
●
If it receives the response “Finlay”, it calls the function show_last. This function hides three
HTML elements on the page with the IDs "first", "second", and "third" by setting their style
attribute to "display:none", effectively making these elements invisible on the webpage.
Simultaneously, it makes a fourth element with the ID "last" visible by setting its style attribute
to "display:block". The HTML elements with IDs "first", "second", "third", and “last" all
contain HTML forms with slightly different content, which are loaded dynamically in different
scenarios.
●
If the credential harvesting script receives the response “Redirect” from the compromised
router, it redirects the browser window to mail.ukr[.]net, indicating the credentials have been
successfully captured.
●
If it receives the response “AGAIN”, the credential harvesting script re-posts the credentials to
the compromised router.
●
If the response “BAD” is received, the text on the form with the “first” element ID is changed to
"Неправильні дані", which is Ukrainian for "Incorrect data". The form's background color is set to
red and the “nowait” function is called, which resets the submit button status so it can be used
again.
●
Finally, if the response contains the term “DATA=”, the script splits and isolates the string after
the search term, replaces single quotes with double quotes, and then uses the JSON.parse
function to turn the stringified JSON data into a JavaScript object. It then iterates over each
element in this data structure. This allows BlueDeltat to dynamically update the displayed web
page based on the data received from the compromised router.
Insikt Group was unable to recover the malicious script hosted on the compromised router, but it is
assumed that it can also relay any CAPTCHA challenges issued by the legitimate website, as described
in the Sekoia report mentioned above. This can be assumed due to similar JavaScript functions noted
on the harvesting page.

In March 2023, a second BlueDelta credential harvesting webpage was detected hosted on InfinityFree,
which exfiltrates victim credentials to webhook[.]site. The webpage impersonates a password change
page from the email and website hosting company Turbify, using the domain
turbify-biz-cesdaz[.]rf[.]gd, as shown in Figure 21.

Figure 21: Turbify credential harvesting page targeting the Center for Economic and Social Development (Source: Recorded
Future)
As shown in Figure 22, the Turbify page contains a malicious JavaScript element that redirects victims
to mail[.]cesd[.]az after credentials are submitted, suggesting that users of this domain were the
intended targets.
The domain cesd[.]az is associated with a leading independent think tank, the Center for Economic and
Social Development (CESD), in Azerbaijan. Recent research by the CESD includes “Assessment of the
economic relations between Azerbaijan and the European Union in the context of the Russian-Ukrainian
war” and “The 12th sanctions package against Russia; Evaluation of the possible impacts of the
economy of Azerbaijan”, likely making them a potential intelligence target for Russian espionage.
Insikt Group could not find any additional pages matching the Turbify theme, likely suggesting that this
is a custom page created solely to target the CESD.

In March 2024, Insikt Group uncovered another credential harvesting page impersonating the popular
webmail software provider MDaemon, as shown in Figure 23. The webpage was hosted on the
InfinityFree domain consumerpanelapp[.]42web[.]io and exfiltrated victim data to pipedream[.]com.
Figure 23: BlueDelta credential harvesting page impersonating MDaemon (Source: Recorded Future)
The MDaemon credential harvesting page displayed a loading bar, which, once complete, displayed the
message “No undelivered messages for you”. Underneath the loading bar was a hyperlink that displayed
the text “Back to inbox”. If clicked, this hyperlink would redirect users to the page
mail2[.]progress[.]gov[.]ua, which is associated with the Ukrainian company State Enterprise Company
Specialized Foreign Trade Firm PROGRESS (SE SZTF "PROGRES"), an official importer and exporter of
military goods and services based in Ukraine.
The credential harvesting page linked image resources from a different legitimate webmail page rather
than hosting them locally. As shown in Figure 24, some of the images were directly linked from the
website ukrinmash[.]com. Ukrinmash is also an official Ukrainian importer and exporter of military
goods and services; therefore, it is highly likely that this credential harvesting page has previously been

used to target Ukrinmash, and BlueDelta has modified it slightly to target SE SZTF "PROGRES" without
updating the images.
Another MDaemon login webpage, delivery-ukrinmash-service[.]infinityfreeapp[.]com, was detected
directly targeting Ukinmarsh. It is possible this was the page modified by the threat actors to target SE
SZTF "PROGRES".
Figure 24: Favicon, CSS, and JavaScript files linked to the Ukrinmash webmail server (Source: Recorded Future)
A similar MDaemon login webpage was also detected, first seen in July 2023, as shown in Figure 25.
The webpage was hosted on pipedream[.]com and exfiltrated credentials to a different Pipedream API
endpoint. The webpage contained the same progress bar as the aforementioned MDaemon page but
redirected victims to the domain mail[.]ste[.]kiev[.]ua after they clicked the Back to Inbox button,
suggesting that users of mail[.]ste[.]kiev[.]ua were the intended victims.
The domain ste[.]kiev[.]ua is associated with the State Foreign Trade Enterprise “SpetsTechnoExport”, a
Ukrainian state-owned company that imports and exports weapons, military products, technologies,
and special-purpose equipment.

Some of these pages displayed fake account activity pages that claimed the victim’s accounts had been
logged into by unauthorized users located in Belarus, China, and Iran. The page also suggested that the
user should reset the password associated with these accounts, as shown in Figure 26.

Insikt Group detected a Yahoo-themed credential harvesting page hosted on the InfinityFree domain
xzdgsdfhfgtjdfj[.]wuaze[.]com, which was active in September 2023. The page exfiltrated data to a
compromised Ubiquiti EdgeRouter linked to the IP address 73.80.9[.]137 and used updated code similar
to the previously described pages.
As shown in Figure 27, the updated code uses the XMLHttpRequest JavaScript object to send the
captured credentials to a script hosted on a compromised router. It then waits for a response and
examines the data returned by responseText before displaying specific dynamic web content to the
victims depending on the returned string, for example:

●
“OPDATA”: If this string is returned, a user prompt asking for a verification code, either via phone
or email, is displayed based on the device returned from the XML HTTP request
●
“BAD-VCODE”: This string indicates the verification code entered was incorrect; the input fields
are editable again to enable the user to retry
●
“OPTIONS”: Similar to OPDATA, but provides different authentication options
●
“Finaly”: This value indicates the authentication process is complete; the user is then
redirected to another page; in this case, mail.yahoo[.]com
●
“AGAIN”: The server requests the client to resend the data, which triggers a recursive call to the
send function with the same data
●
“CHANGE, BAD, BAD-PASSWORD, BAD-CODE, YAK-CODE, and PUSH”: These handle various states of
the authentication process, such as changing the password; incorrect username, password, or
code; and push notification verification; the user interface (UI) is updated for each case to
prompt the user to take the next step or correct errors

At the time of analysis, Insikt Group was unable to recover the malicious script hosted on the
compromised Ubiquiti EdgeRouter. However, per the ukr[.]net credential harvesting pages described
previously, we can assume the scripts will be functionally similar to those previously described by
Sekoia. In this case, they would likely enable BlueDelta to bypass two-factor authentication (2FA) by
relaying authentication codes back to Yahoo.

Victimology
Upon analyzing Headlace geofencing scripts and countries targeted by credential harvesting
campaigns from 2022 onwards, Insikt Group identified that thirteen separate countries were targeted
by BlueDelta. As expected, Ukraine topped the list, accounting for 40% of the activity. Türkiye might
seem like an unexpected target with 10%, but it's important to note that it was singled out only by
Headlace geofencing, unlike Ukraine, Poland, and Azerbaijan, which were targeted through both
Headlace geofencing and credential harvesting.

Mitigations
●
Establish real-time alerts through Recorded Future's Intelligence Cloud to detect typosquat
domains that mimic your brand. This proactive measure helps guard against entities like BlueDelta,
which could exploit these domains for credential harvesting and phishing.
●
Use Recorded Future Identity Intelligence to monitor, detect, and mitigate widespread credential
leaks and theft, enhancing account protection.
●
Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) to add an extra layer of security and make it more
challenging for attackers to abuse compromised credentials.
●
Monitor Insikt Group reporting for the latest threat actor tradecraft, TTPs, targeting, and indicators
of compromise (IoCs) to ensure you are informed of the threat.
●
Use this intelligence to provide comprehensive training on email security best practices,
including identifying phishing emails, suspicious attachments, and links. Regularly reinforce
training to maintain a high level of awareness and vigilance.
●
Assess suspicious email attachments with Recorded Future Malware Intelligence for instant
analysis to quickly assess and understand the associated threats.
●
Monitor your company's attack surface by using Recorded Future’s Attack Surface Intelligence to
automate the detection of potential entry points for attackers and highlight network
configuration changes.
●
Ensure that both software and browser updates are prioritized using the Recorded Future
Vulnerability Intelligence Module and installed regularly. Updates often include patches for
vulnerabilities and replace outdated plug-ins and add-ons, making it harder for threat actors to
exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise a device.
●
Implement a domain name system (DNS)-blocking policy to prevent connections to free hosting
apex domains, such as those used by InfinityFree and free API services, if your company does
not use them.
●
Participate in Recorded Future Collective Insights to harness the power of the Recorded Future
Intelligence Cloud and customer signals to give visibility into threats based on your environment,
industry, and in-the-wild incidents.
Outlook
Insikt Group anticipates that BlueDelta will continue the operations detailed in this report, with an
intensified emphasis on gaining insights into operational capabilities and potential vulnerabilities in
Ukraine's defense sector. BlueDelta’s objective is to acquire intelligence that bolsters Russia's military
endeavors in Ukraine and gather insights into geopolitical dynamics in neighboring nations and NATO
member states. The adaptability, skill, and ferocity demonstrated in this report will continue at pace as
Russia tries to capture intelligence, which gives it an edge on the battlefield and regarding geopolitical
interests.
