OilAlpha:  
A Likely Pro-Houthi Group Targeting 
Entities Across the Arabian Peninsula
CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS | YEMEN
Executive Summary
Since May 2022, Insikt Group has tracked an ongoing campaign by a threat group which is highly likely
to have targeted entities associated with the non-governmental, media, international humanitarian, and
development sectors. It is almost certain that the entities targeted shared an interest in Yemen,
security, humanitarian aid, and reconstruction matters. It is highly likely that OilAlpha threat actors were
involved in espionage activity, as handheld devices were targeted with remote access tools (RATs) like
SpyNote and SpyMax. Our assessment of the victimology suggests that the majority of the targeted
entities were Arabic-language speakers and operated Android devices.
The observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with this threat activity has
included the almost exclusive use of Dynamic DNS (DDNS) for command and control (C2). Additionally,
the threat actors used domain naming conventions associated with international, Saudi Arabian, and
United Arab Emirates (UAE) humanitarian organizations, as well as media organizations, in addition to
non-attributable entities; the threat actors also used encrypted chat messengers, like WhatsApp, to
target victims.
We previously tracked this threat activity under the temporary designators TAG-41 and TAG-62. Insikt
Group is combining these threat clusters under the cryptonym OilAlpha due to overlapping TTPs and
our increased confidence that the activities we have observed are coordinated by a single entity.
OilAlpha is predominantly engaged in espionage, and at the time of this writing, it is likely acting in the
interest of the Houthi movement. The following factors have influenced our assessment:
1.
OilAlpha has relied on infrastructure (PTC) reported to be under the direct control of the Houthi
authorities.
2. The group’s operations have reportedly included targeting persons attending Saudi Arabian
government-led negotiations; coupled with the use of spoofed Android applications mimicking
entities tied to the Saudi Arabian government, and a UAE humanitarian organization (among
others), we suspect that the attackers are targeting individuals the Houthis want direct access
to.

Key Findings
●
OilAlpha is a threat activity group targeting political representatives, media, and journalists for
espionage. The group spoofs various international humanitarian organizations, including entities
in the Arabian Peninsula and a Norwegian non-governmental organization (NGO).
●
OilAlpha has used Android remote access trojans (RATs) like SpyNote and SpyMax. We have also
observed njRAT samples communicating with C2s associated with this group, making it likely
that OilAlpha has used other malware for testing or attack operations.
●
OilAlpha used encrypted chat messengers like WhatsApp to launch social engineering attacks
against its targets. It has also used URL link shorteners.
●
OilAlpha has almost exclusively relied on infrastructure associated with the Public
Telecommunication Corporation (PTC), a Yemeni government-owned enterprise. All of the
Dynamic DNS (DDNS) domains identified as part of our research resolved to IP addresses owned
by the PTC.
●
OilAlpha is likely from Yemen; while analysis of its political allegiance remains fluid, as of this
writing, we are linking this activity to threat actors which support a pro-Houthi movement
agenda.
●
The activity Insikt Group is linking to OilAlpha is not unique throughout the Middle Eastern region.
Various campaigns have been disclosed since 2018 highlighting espionage threats to
smartphones and personnel from multiple sectors, including military and security, academia, the
media, and international humanitarian groups. Many regional espionage groups conduct
campaigns that solely target handheld devices. As handheld devices continue to fulfill a growing
role in corporate and personal environments, attacks targeting them will continue in the medium
to long term.

Initial Detection of Threat Activity
Background
On April 14, 2022, Yemen-based open sources revealed that malicious Android applications were
disseminated to journalists and media representatives through lures associated with Yemeni
development and security matters. The Android applications (APKs) were sent from WhatsApp accounts
using Saudi Arabian telephone numbers to Yemeni nationals. For example, as depicted in Figure 1, an
alleged communique from the Security Belt Forces, which is an armed wing of the Southern Movement
(South Yemen Movement, and al-Hirak) is visible along with an app called “YEMENOFKSA.apk”. The
applications were created using other themes as well, such as “Saudi-Yemen Development App”, and
were reportedly accessible via Google Play and Apple’s App Store. The application identified in open
sources is listed as SpyNote in a public malware repository by a large number of antivirus engines.
Network analysis associated with this application suggested it was configured to communicate via
HTTP on port 5551.

The threat actors targeted their victims with social engineering techniques. Open source reports listed
instances in which political representatives, media personalities, or journalists were reportedly sent
messages around the time that negotiations were hosted in Saudi Arabia, in April 2022. The attacks
transpired via encrypted chat messengers, like WhatsApp. While the first and only wave of social
engineering attacks were detected and reported between April and May 2022, our tracking of DNS
resolution changes for that attacker's domains suggests the threat actors are still active and are highly
likely continuing their operations.
Insikt Research
TAG-41 and TAG-62: Graduating to OilAlpha
Insikt Group observed that the aforementioned applications were associated with at least 2 DDNS
domain clusters that acted as C2 infrastructure (Table 1) for different applications. The DDNS clusters
almost exclusively used infrastructure associated with Yemen’s Public Telecommunication Corporation
(PTC) (AS30873). Throughout March 2023, we also observed threat actors using infrastructure
associated with the France-based dynamic infrastructure provider IELO-LIAZO Services SAS
(AS29075).
The applications were developed using SpyNote or SpyMax, and the file names used similar
international humanitarian, development and reconstruction, or security themes. Throughout 2022 and
early 2023, we tracked these threat clusters with temporary designations as TAG-41 and TAG-62;
however, due to their overlapping TTPs, we are graduating these threat clusters to “OilAlpha”.
Malware, Lures, and Infrastructure
Analysis of the malware in sandbox environments (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10) depicted intrusive
characteristics commonly associated with SpyNote and SpyMax; these included permissions to access
call logs, SMS data, contact information, network information, access to the device’s camera and audio,
as well as GPS location data, among others.

Additionally, file icons associated with the samples were dropped in the sandbox environment,
providing insight about the possible victimology. The icons spoof regional political organizations such
as the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), the United Nations, and regional non-governmental
organizations (NGO) such as Project MASAM, a Saudi Arabian entity dedicated to landmine clearance
efforts, and the UAE's Red Crescent Society, an international humanitarian organization. In a few
instances the icons remained unidentifiable, although the imagery appeared to mimic emblems
associated with the Saudi Arabian government, as depicted in Figure 2 (far right).

Red Crescent, Yemeni Joint Forces, and a Saudi Arabian government emblem (Source: Recorded Future and Hybrid Analysis)
A DDNS domain managed by OilAlpha acted as C2 for applications masquerading as WhatsApp, or as
an adjunct application serving to "protect WhatsApp" (حماية
واتساب) (Figure 3). In April 2021, a sample
called “WhatsApp.apk” was first submitted to a public malware repository and was identified as
SpyNote by a large number of antivirus engines. It shared similar intrusive requests and is detectable in
the Applications Information directory of the Android emulator in the sandbox environment.

As depicted in Figure 1, the threat actors also made use of a URL shortener, 2u[.]pw . The URL
shortener claims to be a regional Arabic-language service, used throughout the Middle East, that offers
its users analytics and marketing services, much like bit[.]ly.
In early 2023, Insikt Group identified 3 more malware samples associated with these threat clusters:
“unjobs.apk”, “KSA-YEMEN.apk”, and “NRC ES.apk”. The 3 samples used mylab123321hm.ddns[.]net for
C2; as noted above, the domain was identified in early Insikt Group reporting affiliated with TAG-41 and
the malware associated with these samples was classified in multiple repositories as SpyNote.

In March 2023, Insikt Group identified an additional malware sample called “KSR HM.apk”. We executed
it in Recorded Future's sandbox environment and revealed an icon linked to the Saudi Arabian King
Salman Humanitarian Aid & Relief Centre (Figure 4). This is the same organization which was spoofed
via OilAlpha's KSA-YEMEN application referenced in Table 2.

OilAlpha has crafted applications with names associated with humanitarian and non-governmental
organizations, including the United Nations and the Norwegian Refugee Council, as well as Saudi
Arabian entities like the King Khalid Foundation, Project MASAM, and the aforementioned King Salman
Humanitarian Aid & Relief Centre. All of these entities conduct or coordinate disaster response and
humanitarian work in Yemen.

Another notable characteristic identified during the installation process included what appeared to be a
permissions request (Figure 6). As the applications were executed, we observed a permission request
load; however, clicking on "enable" (تمكين) appeared to serve no purpose, as all the permissions sought
by the RATs administrator were already granted.

Android-Centric Threat Activity
OilAlpha’s focus in targeting Android devices is not surprising due to the high saturation of Android
devices in the Arabian Peninsula region (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). According to the Statcounter website, in Yemen
alone, between March 2022 and March 2023, Android devices accounted for more than 95% of total
active devices.
Figure 7: Market share of Android devices in Yemen (Source: Statcounter)
Submission Locations
Of the known Android samples linked to OilAlpha threat activity that were submitted to a popular
malware repository, from April 2021 onwards we observed the first known sample, “WhatsApp.apk”,
noted in Table 1, being uploaded from Yemen. Other samples were uploaded from countries in the
Arabian Peninsula, as well as North America and Turkey. While such information may only be an
indicator of threat actor testing, this kind of geolocational information can help with comprehensive
analysis, particularly with attribution and victimology.
Desktop Trojan Samples
Some of the DDNS domains associated with OilAlpha revealed that commodity trojans like njRAT
communicated with attacker infrastructure throughout their operational lifespan. This trend was
observed with C2 domains throughout 2021, and in early 2022. The identified files (Table 3) are generic

Infrastructure Observations
Passive DNS analysis of OilAlpha infrastructure revealed that a C2 domain is typically associated with
an IP address for approximately for 24 to 48 hours and is then rotated to another within the PTC
autonomous system, AS30873; a sample listing of IP addresses seen in April 2023 associated with the
mylab123321hm.ddns[.]net OilAlpha domain is available in Table 4.

175.110.0.0/18 . Additionally, OilAlpha C2 domains have increasingly been hosted on infrastructure
associated with the IELO-LIAZO autonomous system, specifically on CIDR range 91.109.176.0/20 . While
there is insufficient information to determine whether OilAlpha is shifting to the French-based
infrastructure provider for operational security, or other reasons, reporting has revealed its popularity
among Middle Eastern threat actors.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS | YEMEN
Geopolitical Influences
Who Controls The Telecommunications Sector in Yemen
In April 2022 a Human Rights Watch (HRW) report highlighted a case in which Saudi-backed Coalition
airstrikes targeted a PTC facility in the Yemeni city of Hodeidah, which was reportedly occupied by
Houthi (Ansar Allah) authorities. Public reporting (1, 2) also indicates that the telecommunications
sector, in particular the administration of PTC and other government-owned telecommunication entities
like TeleYemen, is controlled by Houthi authorities. Insikt Group research from November 2018 also
revealed information about the power dynamics between the Houthis, the former government of Abd
Rabbuh Mansur Hadi, and efforts to control the telecommunication sector in Yemen. This is notable as
control of Yemen’s telecommunication and infrastructure assets influence our attribution hypothesis
discussed in the Attribution section.
The Iran-Saudi Deal, the UAE, and the link to OilAlpha
In March 2023, Iran and Saudi Arabia embarked on a new diplomatic rapprochement following
negotiations mediated by China. This geostrategic development is likely to reduce tensions between
Iran and Saudi Arabia, in addition to other Arabian Peninsula states, with renewed hope for reducing the
conflict in Yemen. The dialogue reportedly led to Iran agreeing to cease its lethal aid support to the
Houthis, and an Omani initiative is driving toward a permanent ceasefire between Saudi Arabia and the
Houthi movement.
While the Houthis claimed they would not abandon their cause and asserted the new Iran-Saudi
breakthrough would have little to no influence on their conflict against the Saudi-led coalition, Saudi
Arabia and its partners held an official prisoner swap with the Houthis in mid-April, a potential sign of
further de-escalation between the warring parties. Public analysis of the conflict suggests that a truce
may be reached between the Houthis and Saudi Arabia; however, the potential for domestic conflict
between the Houthis, the Southern Movement, and the internationally recognized government's forces
is still elevated.
Other geopolitical influences have materialized in Yemen since the Houthi movement's takeover of
Sana'a in 2014, and the Houthis have been engaged in conflict with and Saudi Arabia and its coalition
partners since March 2015. Yemen deteriorated into a complex and fragmented state, with multiple
internal and external parties pursuing their own security interests. For example, while the UAE is a
partner in the Saudi Arabian coalition against the Houthis, it also supports its own political and military
allies in the Southern Movement, including the Security Belt Forces. As depicted above, OilAlpha used
documents depicting Security Belt Forces comuniques during its social engineering operations (Figure
1).
At least 3 major domestic political currents can affect Yemen's future: the Houthis (backed by Iran), the
internationally recognized government (backed by Saudi Arabia), and the Southern Movement (backed
by the UAE). OilAlpha's operations so far have depicted a clear attempt to spoof Saudi Arabian
11
CTA-2023-0516
Recorded Future® | www.recordedfuture.com
CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS | YEMEN
organizations, as well as one from the UAE and another from Norway. The latter, the Norwegian
Refugee Council, is the outlier, which raises the questions of why a threat group would spoof NGOs or
target NGO-associated individuals in Yemen. Public sources suggest Houthi militia groups have
abducted NGO workers and security. Houthi hardliners are wary of NGOs, which are viewed as tools of
"Western influence" to enable foreign infiltration and espionage.
Attribution: OilAlpha For Whose Interests?
Insikt Group assesses that OilAlpha launched its attacks at the behest of a sponsoring entity, namely
Yemen’s Houthis. OilAlpha could be directly affiliated to its sponsoring entity, or could also be operating
like a contracting party. Public reports have indicated that Houthi operatives have received training and
cooperated in warfighting in operational theaters with Lebanese Hezbollah and Iran's Islamic
Revolutionary Guard Corps' Quds Force (IRGC-QF). Under the banner of the "Axis of Resistance", the
IRGC has helped Lebanese Hezbollah establish its own cyber capabilities, which Hezbollah has
exported to aid Iraqi counterparts with cyber-enabled information operations capabilities. While
OilAlpha's activity is pro-Houthi, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that Yemeni operatives are
responsible for this threat activity. External threat actors like Lebanese or Iraqi Hezbollah, or even
Iranian operators supporting the IRGC, may have led this threat activity.
The infrastructure used throughout OilAlpha's campaigns suggests it persistently uses Yemen’s PTC
assets. We recognize the potential for the PTC's infrastructure to be compromised by a foreign party. At
the time of this writing, however, we have not identified information to support this hypothesis. Public
reports ascertain that the PTC is under the control of Houthi authorities, and we take this information at
face value.
Insikt Group has identified no evidence of activity such as spoofing Houthi communiques, or malicious
APKs claiming to be, for example, a Houthi military app. While these may exist, they are not known to
Insikt Group. The lack of spoofing against the Houthis is notable and moreover, reporting of Houthi
distrust toward NGOs leads us to believe that such a factor likely acted as a driver for OilAlpha's
operations.
The victimology (1, 2, 3) indicates that OilAlpha targeted victims in the media and journalism sectors,
and also likely targeted delegates at a Saudi Arabian conference. Based on their social engineering
attempts, which were written in fluent Arabic and did not include grammatical or idiomatic mistakes, the
attackers are highly likely to be native Arabic-language speakers.
A WhatsApp account (Figure 1) adopted imagery of the current king of Saudi Arabia, Salman bin
Abdulaziz Al Saud, as well as the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud, which was highly likely
used to appear pro-Saudi to the target. If the targets represented Yemen’s internationally recognized
government, such profiles would likely serve to lower suspicions to enable the download of the
malicious Android application.
12
CTA-2023-0516
Recorded Future® | www.recordedfuture.com
CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS | YEMEN
Lastly, since May 2022, Insikt Group research revealed the continued spoofing of Saudi Arabian and
UAE entities, and NGOs (Table 5). There is significant strategic and operational interest by the Houthis
to target individuals from Saudi Arabia or representatives from Yemen’s internationally recognized
government. As noted above, specific counterintelligence elements within the Houthi movement could
have also influenced OilAlpha's targeting requirements.
Other Attribution Considerations
An attribution hypothesis developed by a China-based security vendor suggests that a threat cluster
linked to OilAlpha is associated with an intelligence ministry from a neighboring state in the Arabian
Peninsula. No additional information was provided to ascertain how this assessment was made.
If the assessment is correct, OilAlpha's operators spoofed Saudi Arabian organizations and used Saudi
Arabian telephone numbers to target victims with social engineering attempts while obfuscating their
origins by using Yemeni infrastructure. This is an unlikely scenario, however, as it would defeat the
purpose of creating a false flag by obfuscating attacker-controlled infrastructure, only to then use Saudi
Arabian phone numbers and pro-Saudi Arabian WhatsApp accounts to disseminate the aforementioned
applications.

Mitigations
●
Establish robust policies and carry out social engineering and anti-phishing awareness exercises
to help detect and prevent attacks.
●
Use strong passwords and enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) where possible to limit the
potential damage of credential theft.
●
“Cold-calling” is a common method social engineering operators use to engage with victims. This
includes direct messaging on social media platforms as well as on encrypted chats. Be on the
lookout for signs of inauthentic or reused material and attempt to directly verify with the source
when possible.
Outlook
We do not foresee a reduction in attack operations led by OilAlpha. The group has continued to use the
same TTPs with minor tradecraft shifts, such as the adoption of infrastructure associated with the
IELO-LIAZO autonomous system throughout late March and early April 2023. The use of DDNS
infrastructure and Android-specific malware are the more pertinent aspects of OilAlpha’s TTPs; as
noted in this report, the increased popularity of Android devices throughout the Arabian Peninsula is
highly likely to have factored in the threat actors’ decision-making.
Barring the discovery of new information or broader geostrategic shifts, OilAlpha is likely to continue to
use malicious Android-based applications to target entities that share an interest in Yemen’s political
and security developments and the humanitarian and NGO sectors that operate in Yemen.
