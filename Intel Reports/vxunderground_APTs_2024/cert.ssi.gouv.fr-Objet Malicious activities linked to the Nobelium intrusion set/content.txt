Several cyberattacks against French diplomatic entities can be linked to the Nobelium intrusion set.
Nobelium is an intrusion set active since at least October 2020, used against high-value targets, most
likely for espionage purposes. Western diplomatic entities, such as embassies and Ministries of Foreign
Affairs, account for the majority of known victims of Nobelium. However, several IT companies have also
reported that they have been targeted by Nobeliumâ€™s operators in late 2023 and 2024.
This document is based upon elements collected by ANSSI, elements shared by its national partners
(known as C4 members), and publicly available reports. It exposes phishing campaigns linked to
Nobelium against French public and diplomatic entities aiming to exfiltrate strategic intelligence. It also
recapitulates attacks publicly attributed to Nobelium against international IT companies through which
Nobeliumâ€™s operators potentially seek to strengthen their offensive capabilities.
The Nobelium intrusion set has been publicly linked to the Russian SVR by different sources. Nobeliumâ€™s
activities against government and diplomatic entities represent a national security concern and endanger
French and European diplomatic interests.
Indicators of compromise are available in structured formats on the page CERTFR-2024-IOC-001.
