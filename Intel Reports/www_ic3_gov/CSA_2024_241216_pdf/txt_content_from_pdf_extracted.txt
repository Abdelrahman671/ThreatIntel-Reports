HiatusRAT Actors Targeting Web Cameras and DVRs  
 
Summary  
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is releasing this Private Industry Notification (PIN) to 
highlight HiatusRAT1 scanning campaigns against Chinese -branded web cameras  and DVRs. 
Private sector partners are encouraged to implement the recommendations listed in the 
“Mitigation” column of the table below  to reduce the likelihood and impact of these  attack 
campaigns .  
 
Threat  
HiatusRAT is a Remote Access Trojan (RAT)  whose  latest  iteration has likely been employed 
since July 2022 . Malicious cyber actors commonly use RATs to take over and control a target ed 
device from a distance. The Hiatus campaign originally targeted o utdated network edge 
devices . Cybersecurity companies have also observed these  actors using the malware to target 
                                                           
1 (U) Previous HiatusRAT campaigns have targeted edge routers to passively collect traffic and function as a covert 
network of command -and-control (C2) infrastructure.  
 
 TLP:  CLEAR   
 
TLP: CLEAR  a range of Taiwan -based organizations and to carry out reconnaissance against a US 
government  server used for submitting and retrieving defens e contract proposals.2 
In March 2024, HiatusRAT actors conducted a scanning campaign targeting  Internet of Things 
(IoT) devices in  the US, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom . The actors 
scanned  web cameras and DVRs for vulnerabilities including CVE-2017 -7921, CVE -2018 -9995, 
CVE-2020 -25078, CVE -2021 -33044, CVE -2021 -36260, and weak vendor -supplied passwords. 
Many of the se vulnerabilities have not yet been mitigated by the vendors. In particular, t he 
actors targeted Xiongma i and Hikvision devices with telnet access. They used Ingram —a 
webcam -scanning tool available on Github —to conduct scanning activity . And they used  
Medusa —an open -source brute -force authentication cracking tool —to target Hikvision cameras 
with telnet acces s. Targeted TCP ports have included: 23, 26, 554, 2323, 567, 5523, 8080, 9530, 
and 56575.   
The actor s have demonstrated interest in the below CVEs, likely in furtherance of cyber 
exploitation efforts:  
CVE Description  Mitigation  
CVE-2017 -7921  An improper authentication occurs 
when an application does not 
adequately or correctly 
authenticate users. This may allow 
a malicious user to escalate 
privileges on the system and g ain 
access to sensitive information. 
This issue has been  discovered in  
the following  Hikvision devices: DS-
2CD2xx2F -I Series V5.2.0 Build 
140721 to V5.4.0 Build 160530, DS -
2CD2xx0F -I Series V5.2.0 Build

140721 to V5.4.0 Build 160414, DS -
2CD4xx5 Series V5.2.0 Build 
140721 to V5.4.0 Build 160421, DS -
2DFx Series V5.2.0 Build 140805 to 
V5.4.5 Build 160928, and DS -
2CD63xx Series V5.0. 9 Build 
140305 to V5.3.5 Build 160106.  As of 13 December , 2024, Hikvision 
has not mitigated this vulnerability  
across all impacted devices . 
Hikvision has released updates to 
mitigate the improper 
authentication vulnerability in 
cameras sold through authorized 
distributors.  The updates can be 
found a t: HSRC -201703 -04  
CVE-2018 -9995  TBK DVR4104 and DVR4216 
devices, as well as Novo, CeNova, There are currently no security 
updates to address these flaws.

TLP: CLEAR  QSee, Pulnix, XVR 5 in 1, Securus, 
Night OWL, DVR Login, HVR Login, 
and MDVR Login, which run re -
branded versions of the original 
TBK DVR4104 and DVR4216 series, 
allow remote attackers to bypass 
authentication via a "Cookie: 
uid=admin" header, as 
demonstrated by a 
device.rsp?opt=user&cmd=list 
request that provides credentials 
within JSON data in a response.  Users should immediately  replace 
vulnerable surveillance systems 
with actively s upported models.  
CVE-2020 -25078  An issue was discovered on D -Link 
DCS-2530L before 1.06.01 Hotfix 
and DCS -2670L through 2.02 
devices. The unauthenticated 
/config/getuser  endpoint allows for 
remote administrator password 
disclosure.  Some affected devices are end -of-
life devices.  Updates for affected 
firmware that is still supported can 
be found at : SAP10180  
  
CVE-2021 -33044  An identity authentication bypass 
vulnerability found in some Dahua 
products during the login process. 
Attackers can bypass device 
identity  authentication by 
constructing malicious data 
packets.  Dahua recommends downloading a 
patch  or from its website , Download 
Center , or contacting Dahua 
technical support to upgrade  to a 
newer version . 
CVE-2021 -36260  A command injection vulnerability 
in the web server of some Hikvision 
product s. Due to the insufficient 
input validation, malicious cyber 
actors  can exploi t the vulnerability 
to launch a command injection 
attack by sending messages with 
malicious commands.  Users should download the updated 
firmware from Hikvision at: Security

TLP: CLEAR  Recommendations  
The FBI recommends limiting the use of  the devices mentioned in this PIN and/or isolating them 
from the rest of your network. C ompanies should also regularly monitor networks and employ 
best practices  for cybersecurity, including the following:  
▪ Review or establish security policies, user agree ments, and patching plans to address 
threats posed by these and other malicious cyber actors.  
▪ Patch and update operating systems, software, and firmware as soon as manufacturer 
updates are available. If devices are no longer supported by the manufacturer, consider 
removing them from your network . 
▪ Regularly change network system and account passwords, and avoid re -using passwords 
for multiple accounts. Avoid using default passwords for these devices and/or weak 
passwords.  
▪ Enforce a strong password policy, su ch as requiring strong and unique passwords for all  
password -protected accounts, changing default usernames and passwords, employing 
lock-out rules for failed login attempts, restricting the reuse of passwords, and requiring 
the secure storage of passwords . 
▪ Require multi -factor authentication whe rever  possible.  
▪ Implement security monitoring tools that log network traffic to establish baseline 
activity, and that enable detecting and addressing abnormal network activity, including 
lateral movement on a netwo rk. 
▪ Capture and m onitor remote access/Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) logs and disable 
unused remote access/RDP ports.  
▪ Implement listing policies for applications and remote access that only allow systems to 
execute known and permitted programs under an est ablished security policy.  
▪ Capture and r egularly audit administrative user accounts and configure access controls 
under the concept of least privilege. Account privileges should be clearly defined and 
regularly reviewed and adjusted as necessary.  
▪ Capture a nd regularly audit logs to ensure new accounts are legitimate users  and to 
baseline legitimate user activity .  
▪ Scan network for open and listening ports, and mediate those that are unnecessary.  
 
 TLP:  CLEAR   
 
TLP: CLEAR  ▪ Identify and create offline backups for critical assets.  
▪ Implement network segmentation  wherever possible. If physical network segmentation 
cannot be accomplished, consider logical segmentation .  
▪ Automatically update antivirus and anti -malware solutions and conduct regular virus 
and malware scans.
