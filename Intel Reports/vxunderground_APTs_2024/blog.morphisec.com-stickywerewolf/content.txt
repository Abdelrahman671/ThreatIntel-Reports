Howling at the Inbox: Sticky Werewolf's Latest Malicious
Aviation Attacks
Arnold Osipov ⋮ ⋮ 6/6/2024
Morphisec Labs has been monitoring increased activity associated with Sticky Werewolf, a group
suspected to have geopolitical and/or hacktivist ties. While the group’s geographical origin and home
base remain unclear, recent attack techniques suggest espionage and data exfiltration intent.  
Introduction
Sticky Werewolf is a cyber threat group first detected in April 2023; early activities primarily targeted
public organizations in Russia and Belarus. The group’s operations have since extended to several
sectors, targeting a pharmaceutical company, a Russian research institute dealing with microbiology and
vaccine development, and more.  
In their most recent campaign, Sticky Werewolf have targeted the aviation industry with emails
supposedly from the First Deputy General Director of AO OKB Kristall (a Moscow-based company
involved in the production and maintenance of aircraft and spacecraft). In previous campaigns the group
used phishing emails with links to malicious files. This latest campaign used archive files containing LNK
files pointing to a payload stored on WebDAV servers. 
Infection Chain 
2/8
In previous campaigns, the infection chain began with phishing emails containing a link to download a
malicious file from platforms like gofile.io. However, in their latest campaign, the infection method has
changed.  
The initial email includes an archive attachment; when the recipient extracts the archive, they find LNK
and decoy files. These LNK files point to an executable hosted on a WebDAV server. Once executed, this
initiates a Batch script, which then launches an AutoIt script that ultimately injects the final payload. 
Technical Analysis
Phishing Email
The phishing email, purportedly sent by the First Deputy General Director and Executive Director of AO
OKB Kristall, targets individuals in the aerospace and defense sector.  
The email invites recipients to a video conference on future cooperation, providing a password-protected
archive that containing a malicious payload, and aims to deceive recipients into opening the harmful
attachment under the lure of a legitimate business invitation. 
3/8
Email Attachment 
The initial archive delivered in the phishing email contains three files designed to deceive the recipient
into executing at least one of the malicious email’s contents.  
The archive includes: 
A Decoy PDF File: This file serves as a distraction, providing seemingly legitimate content to
reduce suspicion while the LNK files execute the malicious payload. 

Two LNK Files Masquerading as DOCX Documents:
Повестка совещания.docx.lnk (Meeting agenda): This file is intended to appear as a
legitimate document outlining the meeting agenda. 
Список рассылки.docx.lnk (Mailing list): This file is disguised as a document containing
the distribution list for the meeting. 

PDF
The PDF file, included as a decoy in the phishing archive, is an invitation to a video conference organized
by AO "OKB Kristall" with key enterprises of the "Russian Helicopters" holding. The conference aims to
discuss "Issues of prospective cooperation 2024-2025." 
The PDF also references the two malicious LNK files as attachments, increasing the likelihood of the
recipient opening them. 
Meeting agenda (Повестка совещания.docx.lnk) 
Mailing list (Список рассылки.docx.lnk)

LNKs 
Once the victim clicks the LNK files, the following actions will be triggered: 
First LNK - Повестка совещания.docx.lnk (Meeting agenda) 
Executes the command which performs multiple actions: 
1. Registry Entry for Persistence: Adds a registry entry to run WINWORD.exe from a network share
(\\94.156.8[.]166\Microsoft Office Word$\WINWORD.exe) on login.
 

2. Decoy Message: Displays a message in Russian indicating a document opening error, claiming the
file is corrupted.

3. Copies image.jpg from another network share (\\79.132.128[.]47\image.jpg) to the local root
directory. The file was unavailable at the time of research and is suspected to be used as a decoy. 
Second LNK - Список рассылки.docx.lnk (Mailing List) 
Executes the command \\document-cdn[.]org\Microsoft Office Word$\WINWORD.exe, which will launch
the same executable as in the first LNK file, this time with the domain name resolved by the above IP (at
the time of writing). 
CypherIT Loader / Crypter 
Once the victim clicks the LNK file, the executable from the network share begins running. This
executable is an NSIS self-extracting archive which is part of a previously known crypter named
CypherIT.  
This crypter has been used for several years to deliver malicious payloads in various campaigns by
multiple threat actors. While the original CypherIT crypter is no longer being sold, the current executable
is a variant of it, as observed in couple of hacking forums. 
The NSIS archive extracts its files into the $INTERNET_CACHE directory, which corresponds to
%LocalAppData%\Microsoft\Windows\INetCache, and is typically used for Internet Explorer's temporary
files. After extraction, the installer runs one of the files, an obfuscated batch script. 
Batch Script 
This batch script performs several operations: 
6/8
Delay Execution: If wrsa.exe or opssvc.exe processes are running, the script delays execution
by running ping -n 193 127.0.0.1. 
Change Filenames: If any of the following processes are present: avastui.exe, avgui.exe,
nswscsvc.exe, sophoshealth.exe, the script changes the filenames for the next stage AutoIt
executable and script file extension. 
File Concatenation: Concatenates multiple files into two files: 
A legitimate AutoIt executable. 
A compiled AutoIt script. 
Execute AutoIt: Runs the AutoIt executable, passing the compiled script as an argument.

AutoIT Script 
The executed AutoIT script has various capabilities such as anti-analysis, anti-emulation, persistence,
and unhooking. Its main goal is to inject the payload and establish persistence while evading security
solutions and analysis attempts. 
Anti-Analysis and Anti-Emulation 
The script checks for artifacts or signs belonging to security vendors' emulators and environments: 
Artifact-Type 
Value 
Vendor 
Computer Name  tz 
BitDefender Emulator 
Computer Name  NfZtFbPfH 
Kaspersky Emulator 
Computer Name  ELICZ

File Name 
C:\aaa_TouchMeNot_.txt  Windows Defender Emulator

Process Name 
bdagent.exe 
Bitdefender 
Process Name 
avp.exe 
Kaspersky 
The script then overrides ntdll.dll by mapping a clean copy from the disk and replacing the .text section of
the one loaded — a known technique to remove hooking. 
Persistence 
Persistence is established via a scheduled task or the startup directory. 
Decryption and Injection 
Before injecting the payload, it decrypts it using two shellcodes that perform RC4 decryption. 
1. The first shellcode performs the key scheduling algorithm using the provided passphrase. 
2. The second shellcode implements the PRGA of the RC4 stream cipher. 
The decrypted bytes are decompressed using RtlDecompressFragment with
COMPRESSION_FORMAT_LZNT1. The final payload is then injected using a process hollowing into a
legitimate AutoIT process. 
Conclusion 
The injected payloads typically include commodity RATs or stealers. Recently, Sticky Werewolf has
utilized Rhadamanthys Stealer and Ozone RAT in their campaigns. Previously, the group deployed
8/8
MetaStealer, DarkTrack, NetWire, among others. These malwares facilitate extensive espionage and
data exfiltration. 
While there is no definitive evidence pointing to a specific national origin for the Sticky Werewolf group,
the geopolitical context suggests possible links to a pro-Ukrainian cyberespionage group or hacktivists,
but this attribution remains uncertain.
