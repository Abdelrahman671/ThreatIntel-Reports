RomCom Resurfaces: Targeting Politicians in Ukraine and
U.S.-Based Healthcare Providing Aid to Refugees from
Ukraine
The BlackBerry Research & Intelligence Team ⋮ ⋮ 6/7/2023
Summary
The RomCom threat actor has been carefully following geopolitical events surrounding the war in
Ukraine, targeting militaries, food supply chains, and IT companies. In RomCom’s latest campaign, the
BlackBerry Threat Research and Intelligence team observed RomCom targeting politicians in Ukraine
who are working closely with Western countries, and a U.S.-based healthcare company providing
humanitarian aid to the refugees fleeing from Ukraine and receiving medical assistance in the U.S.
This report is the first part of our research covering the details of RomCom’s latest malicious campaign,
while the second part will cover RomCom's behaviors, including detection engineering.

Technical Analysis
Context
In mid-March 2023, we noticed an uptick in telemetry related to our tracking of the operator behind the
RomCom remote access trojan (RAT). This uptick encompassed the creation of several new domains
and associated artifacts, one of which, “startleague[.]net”,was linked to a file correlating to the SHA256
– c94e889a6c9f4c37f34f75bf54e6d1b2cd7ee654cd397df348d46abe0b0f6ca3, and titled
RemoteDesktopManager.2022.3.35.0.exe.
What is Remote Desktop Manager?
As its name suggests, Devolutions Remote Desktop Manager (RDM) is a legitimate utility designed to
help facilitate secure remote connectivity. It is compatible with many commonly used remote connection
utilities and technologies such as Citrix, FTP, Apple Remote Desktop, TeamViewer, LogMeIn, Microsoft
Remote Desktop (RDP), SSH Shell, and many more.
According to the developer's website:
“Remote Desktop Manager is an application that integrates a comprehensive set of tools and managers
to meet the needs of any IT team. It is designed to centralize remote connection technologies,
credentials, and secure access to these resources. Most connections are established using either an
external library or third-party software.”
Attack Vector
Although it is unclear at this point what initial infection vector was used to kick off the execution chain,
previous RomCom attacks used targeted phishing emails to point a victim to a cloned website hosting
Trojanized versions of popular software. There is a high likelihood that this is the same in this case, as
the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) align. We have confirmed that a cloned website was used
3/16
to host a malicious specially crafted Installer for the Trojanized version of Devolutions Remote Desktop
Manager, and that this malicious website was almost indistinguishable from the legitimate one.
The fake domain utilized a form of typosquatting to attempt to appear as close to the real one as
possible. This kind of domain (ab)use is common in phishing attacks of all kinds, when threat actors set
up online infrastructure with one thing in common: trying to fool the user into believing they are interacting
with the real company or organization, by making their fake website look as much like the real one as
possible. It is important to understand that just because a website has a company name you know and
trust in the URL, that doesn’t mean the site you are visiting is owned or operated by that company.

Figure 1: Example of the real and fake Remote Desktop Manager websites side by side
As shown in Figure 2 below, the malicious file “Installer.RemoteDesktopManager.2022.3.35.0.exe” is
hosted on the observed cloned/fake website.

Weaponization
4/16
Once downloaded by the user, the Trojanized installer from the cloned website makes every attempt to
appear legitimate. Statically, it is a 64-bit executable (.exe) which is signed by an in-date digital signature.
However, further analysis into the legitimate download of Devolutions RDM suggests the signing
information does not corelate and is, in fact, issued by a completely different organization. The fraudulent
certificate obtained from the malicious installer is shown below in Figure 3.
Figure 3: Digital Signature of the Trojanized Installer
Upon execution of the Trojanized main setup file, Installer.RemoteDesktopManager.2022.3.35.0.exe,
the user is prompted to select the destination path of where they’d like the file(s) to be installed.
5/16
Figure 4: Setup Installer for Trojanized DRDM
Unbeknownst to the victim, during this prompt, the malware has already begun its execution chain. The
malware drops various components into a hidden path via C:\Users\Public\Libraries. (Further details can
be found below in Appendix 1: IoC’s.)
Dropped binaries:
update.conf
Installer.RemoteDesktopManager.2022.3.35.0.exe
netid4050320587.dll
prxyms4050320587.dll
desktop.ini (already present)
Recorded TV (already present)
6/16
Figure 5: Components dropped by RomCom are deployed, regardless of 'Setup' 
The core malicious binary related to RomCom is the file %netid4050320587.dll0%. This Dynamic-Link
Library (.DLL) is executed via the Windows host process RunDLL32 in the background while the
unsuspecting victim tries installing the fake software.
This malicious binary is executed, as seen in Figure 6, via: “C:\Windows\System32\rundll32.exe
C:\Users\Public\Libraries\netid4050320587.dll0,Main netid4050320587.dll0”.
Figure 6: Execution of the core RomCom DLL
The malicious dropper contains a legacy installer for the legitimate program to masquerade its purposes
further. This installer is dropped both in C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Temp\%js-TIDj8.tmp%\ and
C:\Users\Public\Library\.
SHA256: b1b015f3762b4b9bfce928401a3b13beee5fb70c989b97a03d57545fc00a1978
In addition to deploying and executing its payload of malware, this Installer will continue seemingly as
intended, so the user is left none the wiser.
On execution (as of April 2023), the Installer for the fake Devolutions Remote Manager will fail its setup
as it cannot send data to the real Devolutions server. When the Installer receives this error, the
installation terminates.
7/16
Meanwhile, the malware has been stealthily deployed on the victim host by the decoy Installer and has
begun to carry out its malicious activities.  
Figure 7: Continuation of Trojanized installer
The function of the malicious files dropped is as follows:
%netid3231462335.dll% –This is the core RomCom RAT payload. It is a new version of the
implant we initially uncovered last Fall. Improvements were made to its obfuscation to thwart static
analysis.
The application's core functionality remains relatively the same, enabling the threat actor full access
to the victim's device.
%prxyms1500330613.dll% –This is the RomCom Loader file. This file is used to execute
RomCom via the command line.
procsys.dll – This is a browser stealer, and steals browser data such as passwords, browsing
history, and site cookies.
update.conf – A small supporting configuration file for RomCom.
The full execution chain is described below in Figure 8.
8/16
Figure 8: Execution of Trojanized RomCom Installer
Networking
Upon successful installation, RomCom will enumerate the infected host and gather some basic host and
user metadata, which is then sent to its command-and-control (C2) server – startleague[.]net – to “check
in”.
Figure 9: Request sent via the WinHTTP API
Additionally, this can be noted via the TCP Stream shown in Figure 10 below.
Figure 10: Wireshark capture of initial RomCom communication
If, for any reason, a connection attempt to its C2 is unsuccessful, the malware appears to have some
redundancy. If its initial requests cannot be handled, it will attempt to connect via ICMP Requests instead.

Network Infrastructure
As mentioned previously, the purpose of the domain rdp-devolutions[.]com is to host RomCom’s cloned
website, both hosting and delivering a Trojanized/fake version of the Devolutions’ Remote Desktop
Manager software.
The domain was registered on 2023-03-09 and initially tied to the IP address 91[.]235[.]116[.]232 for the
time period 2023-03-11 > 2023-03-30, when it was updated to resolve to the IP address
74[.]119[.]239[.]234.

Targets
During the course of our investigations, BlackBerry has identified several victims primarily based in
Ukraine. This aligns with previously seen geolocations targeted by RomCom. We have also observed
evidence of at least one target based in the United States.
The victims targeted are involved in several dissimilar industries such as Military and Healthcare, united
by the common thread of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Additional Findings
GoTo Meeting
Over the course of our investigations, a similar binary was observed containing a confirmed RomCom
implant. This time it was deployed within a Trojanized installation of “GoTo Meeting”, a popular video
conference software commonly used by a variety of enterprises, both large and small.
Following similar TTP’s of previously observed samples of RomCom, the initial attack vector is a
faked/cloned website that appears identical to the legitimate one. Below is an example of the cloned
website for “GoTo Meeting”.
Figure 15: Faked/cloned website of the video conferencing app "GoTo Meeting"
Like other samples of RomCom, it too hosts a Trojanized installer containing a legitimate binary related to
the intended product/service, whilst also containing a RomCom implant that will execute during
installation by the user.

Furthermore, at the beginning of May 2023, the Twitter user “@TLP_R3D” identified a “potential
RomCom C2” infrastructure noted via this tweet. Upon analyzing the noted IoC’s, the BlackBerry Threat
Research and Intelligence team confirmed that the samples in the attack chain indeed contained a
RomCom payload.
Unlike previous samples of RomCom observed through our own investigations, this sample of RomCom
masqueraded as the popular SSH file-transfer tool “WinSCP”, but it does not contain the RomCom
payload itself.
Upon execution of WinSCP-5.21.8-Setup.exe, the malware will attempt to reach out to the noted IoC’s
(below) to download and execute itself.
hxxp://104.234.10.207:7931/itrdd/kcrs/file1[.]txt
hxxp://104.234.10.207:7931/itrdd/kcrs/file2[.]txt
It was confirmed by BlackBerry that these two files contain both the RomCom loader and the RomCom
RAT payload itself.

Conclusions
13/16
Since at least mid-2022, RomCom has been a persistent threat affecting largely Ukrainian-based
organizations, including both Government and Military. As the conflict between Ukraine and Russian
forces escalates in Eastern Europe, the world becomes increasingly polarized by their support of one
side or the other, whether on the ground in Ukraine via the provision of military supplies, or on a country’s
own home turf via healthcare provided to those fleeing the conflict.
Following its observed Ukrainian-based targets, the RomCom group has been sighted by BlackBerry
targeting other possibly pro-Ukrainian affiliated organizations – namely those based in the U.S. – in
recent months. The last-observed campaigns target politicians in Ukraine, and a U.S.-based healthcare
institution running a humanitarian aid program for refugees fleeing from Ukraine.
The threat actor behind the RomCom RAT appears to be actively interested in what Western countries
are doing to support Ukraine, what Ukraine is doing, and who the refugees are receiving help from in the
United States. If medical records stored electronically are stolen, it would be easy for the threat actor
(and those they are affiliated with) to profile the patient and use that data in future war scenarios and in
geopolitics in general. Even the extraction of partial information, such as name, sex, date of birth, and
related data, poses a potential risk to that person and those who provide them with any type of aid in
future.
The second part of this research will cover behavioral detection engineering covering RomCom
operations. Stay tuned to the BlackBerry blog for this and future updates.
