Clearing the Fog of War

1. Executive Summary 
The “fog of war” is a military term used to denote the uncertainty and confusion experienced on the battlefield. 
During periods of growing geopolitical conflict, it becomes increasingly hard to keep pace with new developments. 
This complicates analysis of new TTPs and makes it difficult to distinguish between targeted, state-sponsored 
attacks and conventional criminal activity leveraging new vulnerabilities. The past few months have shown that 
adversaries will take advantage of conflicts – even to advertise attacks or entire campaigns that did not actually 
take place – potentially leading defenders astray and increasing overall confusion. Thus, SOC teams may not be 
equipped with the right information to prioritize their investigations and proactive defensive activities. 
 
With the goal of clearing this fog of war, we examine two recently published attacks targeting the energy sectors 
in Denmark and Ukraine. Thus far, the attacks have been attributed, or loosely connected, to the Russian military 
threat actor known as Sandworm, one of the most notorious APT groups currently active. 
 
Our conclusions include the following: 
 
1. Evidence suggests that the two waves of attacks on Danish infrastructure reported by SektorCERT were 
unrelated. It also suggests that the second wave was simply part of a mass exploitation campaign against 
unpatched firewalls, not part of a targeted attack by Sandworm or another state-sponsored actor. 
2. Our data reveals that the campaign described as the “second wave” of attacks on Denmark, started 
before, and continued after, the period reported by SektorCERT, targeting firewalls indiscriminately in a 
very similar manner, only changing staging servers periodically. We see a prevalence of exploitation 
attempts in Europe, where nearly 80% of publicly identifiable and potentially vulnerable firewalls are 
located.  
3. There is little evidence that OT attacks using ‘living off the land’ (LotL) techniques are faster than 
approaches using custom malware. However, LotL techniques provide a stealth benefit to attackers and 
demonstrate that they continue to deploy new OT-oriented TTPs rather than rely on existing capabilities 
alone. There is also one previously undiscussed advantage to LotL techniques: enabling attackers to 
abstract away from legacy and proprietary OT protocols that lack open-source implementations or 
extensive available documentation. 
These conclusions highlight the importance of correlating observed events with other sources of threat 
intelligence, such as malicious IPs and current known exploited vulnerabilities. The first and second conclusions 
are especially important because they indicate that critical infrastructure organizations across Europe should 
remain alert to attacks on unpatched network infrastructure devices. Dismissing these events as targeted to a 
specific country or organization(s) can put other vulnerable organizations at risk.

Analysis of both incidents highlights the increasing need for OT-specific network monitoring. With this in mind, we 
present mitigation recommendations and indicators of compromise (IOCs) at the end of this report. 
 
What is Forescout’s AEE? 
 
Some observations in this report come from data in the Vedere Labs Adversary Engagement Environment 
(AEE), a set of honeypots on the open internet luring attackers and recording their actions. The AEE is different 
from what is seen in many honeypots because it contains either real or simulated OT/IoT devices – including 
exposed protocols, banners and parts of the filesystem – instead of generic honeypots capturing every kind of 
attack.

2. The Danish incidents: attacks on Zyxel firewalls 
in the energy sector 
On November 13, SektorCERT, the Danish CERT for critical infrastructure, published a report detailing what it 
calls “the most extensive cyber-related attack […] experienced [by critical infrastructure] in Denmark to date.” 
 
In that report, SektorCERT describes how, between the 11th and 30th of May 2023, two waves of attacks (loosely 
connected to Sandworm by the report’s authors) managed to gain access to the infrastructure of 22 companies in 
the Danish energy sector via vulnerabilities in their Zyxel firewalls. While the SektorCERT sensor network quickly 
noticed the attacks, allowing for a rapid response, the attackers reportedly had access to the industrial control 
systems of some companies, forcing several to go into island mode (operating without being connected to the 
energy grid). 
 
2.1. First wave of attacks 
In the first wave of attacks, starting on the 11th of May 2023, a group of attackers exploited CVE-2023-28771, a 
pre-authentication OS command injection vulnerability in the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) packet decoder of 
several unpatched Zyxel firewalls, reachable via port 500/UDP on the WAN interface, and resulting in a root shell.  
 
This serious vulnerability was first made public, together with available patches, on April 25th – more than two 
weeks before the attacks. Although the first public writeup and PoC were only made public on May 19th, a week 
after the first attack wave began, the exploit was fairly trivial. Even though the firmware was encrypted, potentially 
complicating differential patch analysis, a public bypass was available, allowing any moderately skilled attacker to 
develop an exploit in those two weeks. After achieving initial access, the exploited firewalls connected back to 
46.8.198[.]196 and received a command to retrieve current usernames and configuration information. 
 
The SektorCERT report mentions that, at the time of the first wave, no public information was available regarding 
which exposed Zyxel firewalls were vulnerable to CVE-2023-28771 and which were not, and no scans prior to the 
attack were observed. It is not feasible to determine the exact vendor, model, and firmware revision from IKE 
alone – though some older coarse IKE fingerprinting tooling exists. The Metasploit module for CVE-2023-28771 
also lacks an IKE fingerprinting method. 
 
 
 
Clearing the Fog of War

However, at the time of writing this report, HTTP fingerprinting via Shodan shows approximately 43,000 Zyxel 
firewalls (700+ located in Denmark), and Censys shows 1,239 Zyxel firewalls in Denmark (with 687 exposing 
IKE). While the exact firmware revision cannot be determined beforehand, attackers could have built up a list of 
likely Zyxel firewalls from a mix of HTTP and coarse IKE fingerprints and simply assumed they were vulnerable. 
SektorCERT does not mention whether they are certain of the absence of exploitation attempts against non-
vulnerable firewalls. 
 
2.2. Second wave of attacks 
In the second wave, starting on the 22nd of May 2023, (potentially different) attackers started downloading MIPS 
binaries over HTTP from 45.89.106[.]147 to Zyxel firewalls in a targeted energy sector organization. The binaries 
in question are Mirai variants containing indicators of the Moobot flavor. 
 
After installing the malware, the firewalls started communicating on port 56999/TCP (a known C2 port for Mirai 
variants) with a server at “www.joshan[.]pro” (registered three weeks before the attack) resolving to 
185.44.81[.]147. The firewalls then started participating in DDoS and SSH brute-force attacks against targets in 
Hong Kong, the U.S., and Canada. Interestingly, one of the DDoS targets seems to be historically 
associated (through domain resolution both at the time of the attacks and prior to it) with infrastructure 
hosting many kinds of generic malware, such as adware and droppers. 
 
In the days after this initial attack of the second wave, Zyxel firewalls at other SektorCERT member organizations 
were observed similarly trying to download Mirai variants from various staging servers. Investigation of these 
staging server IPs shows that they were historically associated with distribution of many kinds of 
malware, such as Mirai and BASHLITE/Gafgyt variants, adware, ransomware, as well as different 
campaigns, including Log4j exploitation attempts. In addition, some of the filenames under which the 
malware was dropped appear in 3-year old public code of a QBot variant. Successful infection of the 
firewalls was followed by C2 communications with the same IP on port 56999/TCP. 
 
During the same period when the attacks on Danish infrastructure were occurring (more precisely on May 
24-26), we observed, within our AEE, 12 attacks that were very similar to the ones mentioned in the 
SektorCERT report. All these attacks came from 109.207.200[.]43, an address not mentioned in that report. All 
the attacks targeted CVE-2023-28771 and used exploits with similar payloads, indicating that they were adapted 
from a public proof of concept. Exactly as reported by SektorCERT, those IPs downloaded two files from staging 
servers: http://145.239.54[.]169/mipskiller and http://91.235.234[.]81/proxy2 (these servers and files are the same 
as those shown in that report). We also observed one exploit that had a single “reboot” command as payload, 
which was not reported by SektorCERT. The “mipskiller” payload is a Mirai botnet variant and was also observed 
being dropped by the same IP address by other researchers, around the same date (May 25). This was 
subsequent to a mass Internet scan for vulnerable Zyxel firewalls on May 20 – a day after the PoC publication 
and prior to the second wave of attacks on Danish infrastructure. 
 
The botnet sample http://45.128.232[.]143/bins/paraiso.mips that was described in the SektorCERT report was 
made available on MalwareBazaar on May 27. Several other similar samples for different architectures coming 
from the same staging server were also observed on May 27, such as paraiso.arm5, paraiso.arm6, paraiso.mpsl, 
paraiso.x86, which is common for botnets that exploit devices running on multiple architectures. This same IP 
address was also seen dropping another unrelated botnet sample shortly after the attacks (on June 2), and we 
observed it performing port scanning on our AEE as late as July (more than a month after the Danish attacks). 
 
Another sample related to those dropped in the Danish incident was made available on MalwareBazaar on June 
13, shortly after the attacks. The sample is 205.147.101[.]170/fuckjewishpeople.x86, whereas the .mips version 
downloaded from the same server was observed by SektorCERT. 
 
 
Clearing the Fog of War 
6 
All the above evidence points to the second wave of attacks on Danish organizations being part of a 
larger campaign of indiscriminate botnet exploitation using a newly “popular” CVE, rather than a targeted 
attack or something related to the first wave, which had used payloads specific to Zyxel and had happened before 
public proofs-of-concept were available.  
 
Among this activity, SektorCERT also observed traffic, consisting of two single 1340-byte packets, on ports 
10049/TCP and 20600/TCP to the IPs 217.57.80[.]18 and 70.62.153[.]174. Since those IPs have been historically 
associated with C2 infrastructure for the Sandworm-attributed Cyclops Blink malware, this raised alarm at 
SektorCERT. Since Cyclops Blink has been known to target WatchGuard and ASUS network devices. Both of 
those C2 IPs have since been reported by the Romanian National Cyber-Security Directorate as part of the 
infrastructure of the Katana Mirai variant botnet which has been associated with DDoS attacks against Ukraine as 
well as exploitation of CVE-2023-28771. We observed on passive DNS databases that in July, shortly after the 
attacks, one of the “Sandworm” IPs was probably used by a Synology NAS device, as shown in the figure below. 
This means that the connection to Sandworm is very thin, since this IP address could simply be a compromised 
device, part of a broader IoT botnet with shared APT/criminal infrastructure. 
 
 
 
One of the unexplained aspects of this second wave is the initial access vector into the Zyxel firewalls. 
SektorCERT assesses this was likely achieved by exploiting two new vulnerabilities, CVE-2023-33009 and CVE-
2023-33010 (disclosed on May 24). This would make the vulnerabilities zero-days at the time of supposed 
exploitation. While they have since been added to CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, there is 
still no public PoC available (as of December 2023). Given that they are both buffer overflow vulnerabilities, rather 
than the far easier to exploit command injection of CVE-2023-28771, this is inconsistent with the rest of the 
second wave attacks. We find it difficult to believe that anyone would waste such a capability on an approach as 
sloppy as the second wave of attacks. 
 
The SektorCERT report does conclusively state whether or not the second wave targets were hit by CVE-2023-
28771. Notably, the second attack wave started only days after the Metasploit module for CVE-2023-28771 was 
made public, an event which has led to mass exploitation by Mirai-based botnets. Alternatively, the second wave 
targets could have been compromised previously, for instance during the first wave, gone unnoticed, with access 
handed over to Mirai botnet operators. 
 
All the activity we see around that time on the AEE exploiting Zyxel firewalls is, in fact, leveraging CVE-2023-
28771, which, coupled with the discussion above about this being an indiscriminate attack mistaken for a targeted 
incident, indicates that the botnet activity observed by SektorCERT was likely leveraging CVE-2023-28771. Any 
evidence to the contrary would strongly suggest a more targeted attack.

2.3. A critical analysis of both attack waves 
The SektorCERT report states, “whether Sandworm was involved in the attack cannot be said with certainty. 
Individual indicators of this have been observed, but we have no opportunity to neither confirm nor deny it”.  
 
Below are the conclusions we can reach based on the shared report, the evidence from our AEE, and other 
information obtained from open sources: 
 
• 
The first wave exploited a straightforward, if PoC-less, n-day against a limited number of targets. This was 
followed by constrained information retrieval behavior. 
• 
The second wave consisted of Zyxel firewalls becoming infected via unexplained means from staging 
servers with a broad mass exploitation and crimeware history. The connection to Sandworm is very thin. 
The C2 IPs in question have also been associated with the Katana botnet, and while shared infrastructure 
between criminal and state-sponsored operators cannot be ruled out, the behavior of the infected firewalls 
(immediate DDoS and SSH brute-forcing – including against targets with dubious reputations themselves) 
corresponds more to crimeware botnet-building than to state-attributed campaigns looking to infiltrate 
critical infrastructure. 
• 
There is no direct connection between the first and second attack waves. 
It is likely that the second wave was part of regular mass exploitation by botnets which happened to catch the 
Danish energy sector in its wide net, rather than targeting it specifically. The first wave is less clear and more 
sophisticated than the second. Attackers had to create their own exploit and show more constrained behavior. As 
such, a specific focus on critical infrastructure cannot be ruled out. But there seems to be no direct link to 
Sandworm. 
2.4. Beyond Denmark: the risks of Zyxel networking devices on European 
critical infrastructure 
Attacks on Zyxel devices are common. Prior to the incidents reported by SektorCERT, we observed on the AEE 
seven attempts to exploit CVE-2020-9054 and two attempts to exploit CVE-2022-30525 (previous vulnerabilities 
affecting Zyxel devices) between February 16 and May 14 from the following IPs: 27.19.56[.]44, 179.43.145[.]90, 
123.26.149[.]179, 77.64.229[.]43 and 193.32.162[.]159. They all targeted our sensors in the United States. 
 
As we reported in section 2.2, we observed attacks exploiting CVE-2023-28771 during the second wave of 
attacks on Danish organizations. However, after those reported incidents, we continued to observe the following 
IPs exploiting the same vulnerability in a very similar way: 
• 
109.207.200[.]42, 109.207.200[.]43, 109.207.200[.]44, 109.207.200[.]47 between June 15 and June 21, 
using 185.180.199[.]41 as C2. 
• 
64.112.74[.]166 between August 24 and 25, using the same 185.180.199[.]41 as C2. 
• 
45.128.232[.]108 between September 1 and October 1, using 193.34.212[.]225 as C2. 
• 
84.54.51[.]106 between October 17 and 22, using the same 193.34.212[.]225 as C2. 
 
We also observed 193.34.212[.]225 (the last C2 server) performing thousands of scans on IKE port 500 between 
September 27 and October 29. All the activity we saw in this period focused on our European sensors. 
 
Although these attacks attempt to exploit a specific Zyxel vulnerability, their targeting is indiscriminate since they 
hit both real and simulated devices – Zyxel or not – that we host on the AEE. This is further evidence that 
exploitation of CVE-2023-27881, rather than being limited to Danish critical infrastructure, is ongoing and 
targeting exposed devices, some of which happen to be Zyxel firewalls safeguarding critical infrastructure 
organizations.  
 
 
 
Clearing the Fog of War 
8 
This does not mean that these attacks deserve less attention. On the contrary, whether the operator behind a 
botnet is state-affiliated or not, once initial access to networking infrastructure is obtained, the threat actor may 
choose to move further within the network and potentially reach the “crown jewels,” such as sensitive information 
or operational technology.  
 
Given that conventional criminal mass exploitation campaigns frequently resell, or lease, compromised devices as 
part of Initial Access Broker services, including specific access to OT systems, they may eventually end up in the 
hands of more targeted attackers. This makes remaining vigilant critical. 
 
As noted above, there are more than 43,000 Zyxel firewalls currently exposed on Shodan. European 
organizations rely on Zyxel more than their counterparts in any other region of the world. A massive 78% of the 
exposed Zyxel firewalls are in Europe, with 25% in Italy alone. The only country outside of Europe that has a 
significant presence of Zyxel firewalls is the U.S., with approximately 10% of these devices. (See image below). 
 
 
 
Briefly looking at the organizations to which the IP addresses hosting these firewalls are registered, we see at 
least six in the power sector of different European countries, with a total of 161 firewalls, as well as an embassy 
and other municipal utilities on the continent. This is just a fraction of the critical infrastructure organizations that 
will use these devices on IPs registered to their ISPs. 
 
3. The Ukrainian incident: implications of new 
Sandworm TTPs targeting electricity substations 
On November 9, Mandiant released a blog post detailing their response to two disruptive events at a Ukrainian 
electricity substation in mid-October 2022. In the incident, the attackers – attributed by Mandiant to Sandworm – 
tripped the substation circuit breakers to cause a power outage that coincided with a series of Russian missile 
strikes across Ukraine. The incident was part of a larger wave of simultaneous cyber and missile attacks on 
Ukrainian critical infrastructure in 2022 that included the Industroyer2 attack – also attributed to Sandworm. 
 
 
 
Clearing the Fog of War 
9 
One aspect worth highlighting from the October 2022 incident is Sandworm’s use of a new TTP. Unlike the 
original Industroyer and Industroyer2 incidents, where circuit breakers were opened via IEC-104 telecontrol 
protocol messages, the 2022 attackers used native SCADA scripting capabilities. 
The attackers compromised a hypervisor instance hosting the MicroSCADA (produced by Hitachi Energy, 
previously ABB) instance for the targeted substations and executed a malicious Supervisory Control 
Implementation Language (SCIL) script via the native scilc.exe utility (T0807, T0871). This utility is an interpreter 
for the proprietary SCIL language which allows operators to automate interactions with the MicroSCADA 
environment. While unable to retrieve the malicious script due to anti-forensic measures employed by the 
attackers, Mandiant assessed that it likely consisted of a series of commands to open circuit breakers (T0855, 
T0831) which MicroSCADA would translate to telecontrol commands to the RTU, for instance via IEC-104/101. 
 
In the paragraphs below, we compare this LotL approach to the manual HMI interaction of the 2015 Sandworm 
attacks on Ukraine and the custom malware approach of the original Industroyer and Industroyer2 attacks. For 
more details about Industroyer2, see our dedicated analysis. 
 
3.1. Stealth 
The use of native utilities, especially a proprietary scripting language, is certainly stealthier than custom 
executable malware. It is unlikely that XDR solutions will raise alerts on malicious scripts in such proprietary 
scripting languages, neither while the script is in transit nor as it is executing natively. In addition, depending on 
an attacker’s implementation, a SCIL approach could compare favorably in terms of stealth to Industroyer’s noisy 
IEC-104 Information Object Address (IOA) brute-forcing approach. 
 
3.2. Process comprehension 
This LotL approach benefits an attacker with regards to process comprehension requirements, such as the need 
to understand significant parts of the target system and physical process:  
 
• 
First, unlike with Industroyer, attackers do not have to communicate directly with RTUs nor do they have 
to know brute-force telecontrol addressing information like IEC-104 IOAs.  
• 
Second, SCIL enables attackers to automatically list MicroSCADA application objects, including Process 
objects (e.g., switches, sensors and breakers), associated with Process stations, such as RTUs, PLCs, 
and IEDs, that fulfill given conditions and type criteria (e.g., listing all breakers), and read and set their 
attributes, such as breaker positions, via SCIL statements. 
This enables attackers to blindly enumerate breakers and open them without knowing the particulars of a given 
substation configuration, Industroyer already had such a fire-and-forget capability, albeit noisier and cruder. In 
addition, if an attacker wishes to achieve a particular outcome, such as causing outages at specific substations, 
this approach still requires some degree of non-automated process comprehension, such as knowing the correct 
station numbers. 
 
 
 
Clearing the Fog of War 
10 
3.3. Speed and scalability 
While certainly faster and more accurate than the manual HMI-based approach of the 2015 attacks, a native 
script does not necessarily get the job done faster than custom malware. 
 
It has been argued that this LotL approach is both nimbler and less development-time-intensive than attacks 
driven by custom malware. While Mandiant reported that the October 2022 incident unfolded over a short period 
(with access reportedly being obtained only 3 months prior to the power outage), it is unclear whether this was 
due to less complex attack requirements or highly compressed timelines arising from battlefield conditions. While 
some of the deployed scripts reportedly had timestamps dating back to September 2022, suggesting the attackers 
may have developed the SCIL-capability only 2 months after initial access, it is equally likely that the attackers 
already possessed such a capability and simply created the launch scripts after deciding upon execution timelines 
and targets.  
 
Since the threat actor needs to learn a new proprietary scripting language, development of the SCIL capability 
could have been performed in advance (a sensible investment given the popularity of MicroSCADA in the 
electricity sector). By contrast, while developing custom malware capabilities for OT protocols seems far more 
development intensive, prior reporting by Forescout Vedere Labs on Industroyer2 and by Mandiant on 
COSMICENERGY suggests that both lifted their IEC-104 protocol implementations from open-source projects. 
Therefore, this data alone does not conclude which approach is more time intensive. 
 
3.4. An additional benefit of LotL 
One previously unmentioned benefit of the LotL approach is that it abstracts away from legacy and proprietary OT 
protocols. While most modern substations typically use the likes of IEC-104/101, IEC 61850, and/or DNP3, there 
still exist many older substations where one may encounter protocols like RP-570/571, SINAUT, or one of the 
Telegyr flavors, all of which lack easy to copy-paste open-source protocol stack implementations. This benefit is 
even more pronounced when targeting Distributed Control Systems (DCS) rather than SCADA, given that the 
former are dominated by proprietary protocols. Simply reverse-engineering  such protocols takes anywhere from 
weeks to six months, as shown by prior Forescout Vedere Labs research. 
 
Many SCADA and DCS solutions have native scripting capabilities that are similar to MicroSCADA’s SCIL. 
Typically, the former consist of server and/or HMI scripting engines that allow for automation code to be run either 
directly or by a trigger, such as time or condition. Examples include: 
• 
IEC 61131-3 capabilities in Siemens SICAM PAS and Schneider GeoSCADA servers 
• 
VBA and/or VBS capabilities in Siemens WinCC / SICAM SCC, Schneider GeoSCADA, GE iFix, 
Honeywell Experion LX, and ABB 800xA 
• 
Proprietary scripting languages in VTScada and Siemens WinCC OA / PVSS

4. Conclusions and recommended mitigations  
There are two main takeaways from our analysis of these incidents targeting the energy sector: 
1. While the Danish energy sector incident shows the power of extensive network monitoring and a quick 
and coordinated response (no easy feat during massive exploitation campaigns), it also shows the 
uncertainty around attacker intent and the level of incident seriousness that can arise during such an 
event. Distinguishing between a state-sponsored campaign targeted at disrupting critical infrastructure 
and crimeware mass exploitation campaigns, and accounting for possible overlaps between the two, is 
more easily done in hindsight than in real time. Contextualization based on detailed threat and 
vulnerability intelligence can help security professionals identify where to focus. In addition, this incident 
shows once again the frailty of perimeter security devices and the continuing need for complementary 
monitoring.  
2. Rather than a major leap forward, the emergence of OT-oriented LotL TTPs in the October 2022 
Ukrainian incident primarily represents a stealth benefit to attackers due to the common lack of detection 
and hardening capabilities around native OT scripting functionality. It also shows attackers continue to 
develop new OT-oriented TTPs rather than rely solely on existing capabilities. 
The analysis in this report and the conclusions above inform several mitigation recommendations: 
• 
Identify, patch, and harden exposed network infrastructure/perimeter devices. These devices are 
leveraged by threat actors both in targeted attacks and in mass exploitation attempts. Keeping track of a 
growing number of vulnerabilities that affect these devices is a challenge. Yet, security teams must be 
aware of which devices are exposed on their network perimeters and how they are vulnerable. They must 
be able to patch or mitigate as soon as possible. Regardless of new vulnerabilities emerging in 
networking devices, they often have exposed management interfaces and other services that should not 
be made available on the Internet. Ensure you have full visibility of the services that are exposed and 
which credentials are used in those services. 
• 
Segment the network to prevent lateral movement from/to exposed assets. There may be critical IT 
or OT devices connected directly to, or residing in the same network as, the exposed network 
infrastructure. It is important to limit communications from/to these perimeter devices as much as 
possible, possibly only to a limited set of trusted peers, to prevent attackers from moving deeper into the 
network from a newly compromised device. 
• 
Monitor OT networks to detect ongoing threats. Even if a network is well-segmented, it is crucial to 
use OT-aware deep packet inspection solutions to monitor device communication. Such solutions can 
issue alerts whenever communications are known to be malicious or look suspicious and could indicate 
an attack. Although LotL makes it more difficult to detect anomalous communication using specific 
protocols, network monitoring allows for threat detection and response solutions to correlate multiple 
signals from the network and endpoints, to find incidents in real time. 
• 
Use up-to-date threat intelligence, such as malicious IPs and known exploited vulnerabilities. This 
intelligence helps network monitoring tools to detect malicious communications, files, and actions by 
matching against known indicators. Below, we provide a list of indicators of compromise (IoCs) that can 
be used to identify potential attacks related to the campaign targeting Zyxel firewalls. These IoCs are also 
available on our public threat feed. We do not include the original SektorCERT IoCs, which can be 
obtained from their report, nor the Sandworm IoCs, which can be obtained from Mandiant’s blog post on 
the topic.
