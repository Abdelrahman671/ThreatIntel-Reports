MuddyWater campaign abusing Atera Agents
Identifier: TRR240402.
Summary
We have been closely monitoring the activities of the Iranian state-sponsored threat actor MuddyWater since the
beginning of 2024. Our investigations reveal an active campaign that has been ramping up since October 2023,
aligning with the Hamas attack that took place that month1. In this latest campaign, MuddyWater has been heavily
relying on a legitimate remote monitoring and management (RMM) tool called Atera Agent.
Over the course of our investigation, several publications234 have detailed various aspects of this attack campaign.
Consequently, our report shares new insights and information regarding MuddyWater use of Atera Agents, not
previously highlighted in these reports.
Background
MuddyWater, an Iranian state-sponsored threat actor, has been relying on legitimate remote monitoring and
management (RMM) software as a first stage payload in its attacks, since at least 20215. Since then, the actor has
tested different RMM tools, from ScreenConnect, Syncro, SimpleHelp, RemoteUtilies and most recently, Atera Agent.
Atera Agent does not require any infrastructure to be set up by the attackers, providing them with better operational
security.
Since late October 2023, we have noticed a significant increase in the use of Atera Agent installation packages linked
to MuddyWater, continuing through to April 2024:
Figure 1 – Estimated timeline of Atera agent activity
Similarly to previously reported misuse cases6, MuddyWater exploited Atera’s free trial offers. The Atera Agent
agents seen in this campaign has been registered using a mix of compromised business and private email accounts.
We suspect that the threat actor accessed these accounts through a variety of methods, such as password spraying,
exploiting reused passwords, utilizing credentials from data breaches, or even purchasing them. Additionally, there is
a possibility that private email accounts were specifically registered for the purpose of creating Atera accounts.

Infection chain
The group continues to leverage free file hosting platforms for hosting their RMM installers, employing spearphishing
emails to direct recipients to these files.
Figure 2 – Observed spreading
methodology
These emails contained links leading to various file-sharing websites, which either hosted an archive with the Atera
Agent installer or provided direct access to the installer itself.
It is important to note that, to our knowledge, the email accounts registered with Atera were distinct from those used
to disseminate the spearphishing emails.
Spearphishing
The quality of MuddyWater’s spearphishing emails has significantly improved since their earlier emails in October
2023. The threat actor has refined their social engineering tactics, crafting more convincing and tailored lures to
deceive their targets. The emails observed in the recent campaign from April 2024 (see Fig. 3) demonstrate a higher
level of sophistication compared to those from October 2023 (see Fig. 4), with more persuasive content and
professional formatting:

Atera RMM
Atera offers users a free 30-day trial of their platform, which allows the generation of Atera ‘Agents’, using any email
account. These agents are configured to call back to this account and could be controlled directly via the website:
Figure 5 – Atera Web UI
This eliminates the need for the attacker to establish its own C2 infrastructure, making it a more appealing choice
compared to previously used RMM solutions like SimpleHelp.
Atera provides comprehensive remote control capabilities directly from the Web UI, including the ability to
upload/download files, run an interactive shell (see Fig. 6), and even use generative AI command assistance.
4/10
Figure 6 – Atera Web PowerShell UI
While email verification is not required prior to generating agents, a ‘registration successful’ email is sent to the
address used. Although the owner of the email address could naturally reset the password and access the Atera
account, in the cases we studied, the attacker had access to the email account used to register with Atera.
We observed Atera Agent binaries configured using emails belonging to individuals whose other email account
passwords had been leaked. We believe that MuddyWater exploited password reuse to gain access to additional
email accounts, which were then used to register Atera Agents. In some cases, the email accounts used appeared to
have been obtained through the sale of leaked OWA credentials. In other instances, the credentials of another email
account belonging to the same person had been compromised, allowing the threat actor to access additional
accounts through password reuse.
Malicious Atera Agents installation packages
The following Atera Agent installation packages are highly suspected to be registered and operated by MuddyWater,
judging from their distribution method, the email account used to register them and in some cases, the targets that
received said emails.
Leaked email credentials

This early Atera Agent sample caught our attention due to its configuration using what appears to be a student’s
email address from an associate degree student at a university in Turkey. We found this exact email address in a
partial sample of an OWA (Outlook Web Access) credentials leak that was published a month before the agent’s
estimated active time. The leak sample suggests that the full set of compromised credentials may have been put up
for sale.

These two Atera Agents were configured using an email address belonging to a 2019 graduate of the Royal College
of Arts in London. The individual’s personal email address was exposed in a data breach that occurred in the same
5/10
year they graduated, suggesting that the attacker likely exploited a case of credential stuffing.
However, the distribution of these Atera Agents was carried out using an email address belonging to the targeted
organization. The attacker crafted a spearphishing email with a lure tailored specifically to the organization:

Distribution using Zendesk Chat
A more recent sample, uploaded on 1st of April 2024 demonstrates an interesting new distribution method, using
Zendesk:

Like other Atera Agent installers discribed in this report, this installer was packed in a ZIP archive. However, this
parent archive was hosted on Zendesk Chat’s (formerly Zopim Chat) file sharing infrastructure:
https://v2uploads.zopim[.]io/2/u/K/2uKM8Mhn4WHvqm9pjHrjaogyOYub9ouO/892fedae59b274ca24916de33650d318168c
We suspect that the attacker uploaded the malicious archive during a chat session, likely posing as a
visitor/customer, but possibly as an agent/support provider.
According to Zendesk’s documentation, “Attached files are uploaded as links in a chat session. Regardless of your
authentication settings, those links can be accessed by anyone with the URL.7“. This allowed the attacker to obtain a
direct, non-expiring link to the archive, which they could then distribute via email.
Further investigation revealed that the email address used to register the Atera Agent was part of multiple data
breaches dating back to 2016, with the most recent breach potentially occurring just a month before the registration.
Hunting for additional Atera Agents distributed via Zendesk, we found another suspicious agent configured with a
Gmail account. This particular agent dates back to October 2023:
Filename
N/A
Hash (SHA256) 9b49d6640f5f0f1d68f649252a96052f1d2e0822feadd7ebe3ab6a3cadd75985
Est. time active 2023-10-26
In this case, the Atera Agent installer was not packed in a ZIP archive but instead directly uploaded to Zendesk Chat.
Interestingly, the hosting URL contains the same identifier as the previously discovered agent, suggesting that both
malware samples may have been uploaded within the same chat instance, albeit at different times.
It’s important to note that while Zendesk typically scans files uploaded to tickets for malware, attachments to tickets
originating from standalone Chat subscriptions are not scanned8. This limitation in Zendesk’s malware scanning
process appears to have been exploited by the threat actor to distribute the malicious Atera Agent installer.

These Atera Agents are configured with an email address belonging to an individual working at the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs of Paraguay. Notably, the same email was found in a leaked list of Outlook Web Access (OWA)
credentials, also dating back at least a month earlier.

The agent, named after the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) operation “Swords of Iron”, was distributed via
filetransfer[.]io, likely linked in a spearphishing email sent by the threat actor.

The email used to register this Atera Agent belongs to a graduate of “Kinneret Academic College”. MuddyWater have
been targeting this academic institution following a compromise9 to “Rashim Software”, an administration platform
that Kinneret was using.

These Atera Agents were configured with the same email address belonging to an individual working in an IT
company. The filenames of the agents indicate that they were targeting an Israeli Tourism company (תוכנת תיירות.msi
translates to ‘Tourism Program’ in Hebrew).
Both Atera Agents were hosted using “Egnyte” cloud file sharing platform. The attacker set up a custom Egnyte
subdomain using the name of the aforementioned “Kinneret” University kinneretacil.egnyte[.]com, by a user
named ori ben-dor.

The same username was used to upload Atera Agent configured with a different email (belonging to an

Finally, the most recent Atera Agent was distributed using a very well made social engineering spearphising email
(see Fig. 1):

This Atera Agent was configured with an email address belonging to an employee of an Airline in Algeria.
We found a tie to between this agent and another Atera Agent, spread to some of the same targets:
Filenameתכנית מועצת מחוז גולן.msi
Hash (SHA256) fb58c54a6d0ed24e85b213f0c487f8df05e421d7b07bd2bece3a925a855be93a
Est. time active 2024-04-08
The malware was spread via a spearphishing email (Fig. 3) sent from an email account unrelated to the one used to
register it with Atera. The spearphishing email contained a link to a custom Egnyte subdomain matching the lure’s
contents. This Egnyte asset hosts a ZIP archive containing the Atera Agent installation package.
Our investigation suggests that the attacker compromised an email account at the victim organization, possibly by
leveraging credentials from another leaked email account that we discovered within that org. Using the compromised
account, the attacker then sent spearphishing emails to other organizations, targeting contacts in other organizations
from the compromised email’s address book.

Targets
Basing on the accounts used to register the Atera Agents, as well as emails we analyzed, we believe that
MuddyWater targeted the following sectors between October 2023 and April 2024:
Airlines, IT Companies, Telecommunication, Pharmaceutical, Automotive manufacturing, Logistics, Travel and
Tourism, Employment/Immigration agency, as well as small businesses across Israel, India, Alegria, Turkey, Italy and
Egypt (see Fig. 9).
Fig. 9 – Map of suspected targets
Conclusions
MuddyWater places a high priority on gaining access to business email accounts as part of their ongoing attack
campaigns. These compromised accounts serve as valuable resource, enabling the group to enhance the credibility
and effectiveness of their spear-phishing efforts, establish persistence within targeted organizations, and evade
detection by blending in with legitimate network traffic. Adding to that the use of RMM software (previously self-
hosted, now in-cloud), as well as using various file hosting providers, makes this sort of activity challenging to detect
and track.
Moreover, as highlighted in the Deep Instinct report on DarkBeatC23, there are indications of collaboration and hand-
off of compromised targets between Iranian threat actors to conduct supply-chain attacks. This suggests that
MuddyWater may not only actively compromise business email accounts themselves but also receive access to
previously breached accounts from other affiliate groups. Similarly, the OP INNOVATE blog post on Lord Nemesis9
demonstrates how the group exploited privileged credentials obtained from the Rashim Software breach to infiltrate
the networks of Rashim’s clients in the Israeli academic sector. This further underscores the value of compromised
business email accounts as a stepping stone for launching additional attacks.
Unfortunately, we do not hold any information about the specific stages and actions the actor takes once it has
successfully deployed the Atera Agent on a targeted system. We suspect that the group does not rely on the
deployed RMM software for a long term, but rather uses it as a first stage in their attack, likely deploying a
PowerShell implant as the next stage, as seen in previous attacks10.
We encourage affected organizations and fellow researchers to collaborate with us in gaining a more comprehensive
understanding of MuddyWater attack campaigns. Together we can offer the community better chances to detect,
respond to and hunt for new malicious activity.
