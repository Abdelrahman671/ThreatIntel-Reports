This post was authored by Edmund Brumaghin, Earl Carter, Warren Mercer, Matthew Molyett,
Matthew Olney, Paul Rascagneres and Craig Williams. 
Note: This blog post discusses active research by Talos into a new threat. This information
should be considered preliminary and will be updated as research continues. 
Talos recently published a technical analysis of a backdoor which was included with version 5.33
of the CCleaner application. During our investigation we were provided an archive containing ¡les
that were stored on the C2 server. Initially, we had concerns about the legitimacy of the ¡les.
However, we were able to quickly verify that the ¡les were very likely genuine based upon the web
server con¡guration ¡les and the fact that our research activity was re¢ected in the contents of
the MySQL database included in the archived ¡les. 
In analyzing the delivery code from the C2 server, what immediately stands out is a list of
organizations, including Cisco, that were speci¡cally targeted through delivery of a second-stage
loader. Based on a review of the C2 tracking database, which only covers four days in September,
we can con¡rm that at least 20 victim machines were served specialized secondary payloads.
Below is a list of domains the attackers were attempting to target. Not all companies identi¡ed in
the targets .php ¡le were seen communicating with a secondary C2 or had a secondary payload
deployed.

Interestingly the array speci¡ed contains Cisco's domain (cisco.com) along with other high-pro¡le
technology companies. This would suggest a very focused actor after valuable intellectual
property. 
These new ¡ndings raise our level of concern about these events, as elements of our research
point towards a possible unknown, sophisticated actor. These ¡ndings also support and reinforce
our previous recommendation that those impacted by this supply chain attack should not simply
remove the affected version of CCleaner or update to the latest version, but should restore from
backups or reimage systems to ensure that they completely remove not only the backdoored
version of CCleaner but also any other malware that may be resident on the system. 
The contents of the web directory taken from the C2 server included a series of PHP ¡les
responsible for controlling communications with infected systems. The attacker used a symlink
to redirect all normal tra£c requesting 'index.php' to the 'x.php' ¡le, which contains the malicious
PHP script. 
In analyzing the contents of the PHP ¡les, we identi¡ed that the server implemented a series of
checks to determine whether to proceed with standard operations or simply redirect to the
legitimate Piriform web site. The contents of the HTTP Host header, the request method type,
and the server port are checked to con¡rm that they match what is expected from beacons sent

and the server port are checked to con¡rm that they match what is expected from beacons sent
from infected systems. 
The PHP contains references to the required table for information storage within the 'x.php'
variables as de¡ned: 
Within 'init.php' the $db_table is declared to allow insertion into the required database on the
attacker infrastructure. This is 'Server' as de¡ned below.

The web server also contains a second PHP ¡le (init.php) that de¡nes core variables and
operations used. Interestingly, this con¡guration speci¡es "PRC" as the time zone, which
corresponds with People's Republic of China (PRC). It’s important to note that this cannot be
relied on for attribution. It also speci¡es the database con¡guration to use, as well as the
¡lename and directory location to use for the variable $x86DllName. 
The following information is gathered from infected systems, which is later used to determine
how to handle those hosts. This includes OS version information, architecture information,
whether the user has administrative rights, as well as the hostname and domain name
associated with the systems. 
The system pro¡le information was rather aggressive and included speci¡c information such as a
list of software installed on the machine and all current running processes on the machine with
no surprise that 'CCleaner.exe' was a current running process on the victim machine. The system
pro¡le information is then stored in the MySQL database.  
There is also functionality responsible for loading and executing the Stage 2 payload on systems
that meet the prede¡ned requirements, similar to functionality that we identi¡ed would be
required in our previous analysis of Stage 1. While there is shellcode associated with both x86
and x64 PE delivery, it appears that only the x86 PE loading functionality is actually utilized by the
C2 server.

The PHP script later compares the system beaconing to the C2 to three values: $DomainList,
$IPList, and $HostList. This is to determine if the infected system should be delivered a Stage 2
payload. Below is condensed PHP code that demonstrates this: 
The use of domain-based ¡ltering further indicates the targeted nature of this attack. While we
have con¡rmed that the number of systems affected by the backdoor was large based upon
beacon information stored within the MySQL database, the attackers were speci¡cally controlling
which infected systems were actually delivered a Stage 2 payload. While it was reported that no
systems executed a Stage 2 payload, this is not accurate. In analyzing the database table storing
information on the systems that were delivered a Stage 2 payload, we identi¡ed 20 unique hosts
that may have been affected by this payload. The functionality present within Stage 2 is
documented in the "Stage 2 Payloads" section of this post.  
The C2 MySQL database held two tables: one describing all machines that had reported to the
server and one describing all machines that received the second-stage download, both of which
had entries were dated between Sept. 12th and Sept. 16th. Over 700,000 machines reported to
the C2 server over this time period, and more than 20 machines have received the second-stage
payload. It is important to understand that the target list can be and was changed over the period
the server was active to target different organizations.

During the compromise, the malware would periodically contact the C2 server and transmit
reconnaissance information about infected systems. This information included IP addresses,
online time, hostname, domain name, process listings, and more. It's quite likely this information
was used by the attackers to determine which machines they should target during the ¡nal
stages of the campaign.  
The main connection data is stored in the "Server" table. Here is an example of one of Talos'
hosts in that database table: 
In addition, the compromised machines would share a listing of installed programs.  
A process list was also captured.

When combined, this information would be everything an attacker would need to launch a later
stage payload that the attacker could verify to be undetectable and stable on a given system. 
A second database table, separate from the 'Server' database table, contained an additional
information set that was associated with systems that had actually been delivered the Stage 2
payload. This table contained similar survey information to the 'Server' database table, the
structure of which is shown below:

In analyzing this second database table 'OK', we can con¡rm that after deduplicating entries, 20
systems were successfully delivered the Stage 2 payload. Talos reached out to the companies
con¡rmed affected by this Stage 2 payload to alert them of a possible compromise. 
Based on analysis of the 'Server' database table, it is obvious this infrastructure provides
attackers access to a variety of different targets. Given the ¡ltering in place on the C2 server, the
attackers could add or remove domains at any given time, based upon the environments or
organizations they choose to target. To provide additional perspective regarding the types of
systems that the attackers could choose to further compromise, the screenshot below shows the
number of total entries that were contained within the database table used to store system pro¡le

number of total entries that were contained within the database table used to store system pro¡le
information: 
The following screenshot shows the number of affected government systems around the world. 
Likewise, looking at compromised systems belonging to domains containing the word 'bank'
returns the following results: 
This demonstrates the level of access that was made available to the attackers through the use
of this infrastructure and associated malware and further highlights the severityand potential
impact of this attack. 
The stage 2 installer is GeeSetup_x86.dll. This installer checks the OS version and then drops
either a 32-bit or 64-bit version of a trojanized tool. The x86 version is using a trojanized
TSMSISrv.dll, which drops VirtCDRDrv (which matches the ¡lename of a legitimate executable
that is part of Corel) using a similar method to the backdoored CCleaner tool. The x64 version
drops a trojanized EFACli64.dll ¡le named SymEFA which is the ¡lename taken from a legitimate
executable that is part of "Symantec Endpoint". None of the ¡les that are dropped are signed or
legitimate.

Effectively, they patch a legitimate binary to package their malware. Additionally, the setup put an
encoded PE in the registry :  
HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\WbemPerf\001 
HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\WbemPerf\002 
HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\WbemPerf\003 
HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\WbemPerf\004 
The purpose of the trojanized binary is to decode and execute this PE in registry. This PE
performs queries to additional C2 servers and executes in-memory PE ¡les. This may complicate
detection on some systems since the executable ¡les are never stored directly on the ¡le system.
Within the registry is a lightweight backdoor module which is run by the trojanized ¡les. This
backdoor retrieves an IP from data stegged into a github.com or wordpress.com search, from
which an additional PE module is downloaded and run. The stage 3 payload also reaches out to
"get.adoble.net" 
Talos has reviewed claims from Kaspersky researchers that there is code overlap with malware
samples known to be used by Group 72. While this is by no means proof in terms of attribution,
we can con¡rm the overlap and we agree that this is important information to be considered.

Supply chain attacks seem to be increasing in velocity and complexity. It's imperative that as
security companies we take these attacks seriously. Unfortunately, security events that are not
completely understood are often downplayed in severity. This can work counter to a victim's best
interests. Security companies need to be conservative with their advice before all of the details of
the attack have been determined to help users ensure that they remain protected. This is
especially true in situations where entire stages of an attack go undetected for a long period of
time. When advanced adversaries are in play, this is especially true. They have been known to
craft attacks that avoid detection by speci¡c companies through successful reconnaissance
techniques.  
In this particular example, a fairly sophisticated attacker designed a system which appears to
speci¡cally target technology companies by using a supply chain attack to compromise a vast
number of victims, persistently, in hopes to land some payloads on computers at very speci¡c
target networks.  
Additional ways our customers can detect and block this threat are listed below. 
 
Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) is ideally
suited to prevent the execution of the malware
used by these threat actors. 
 
CWS or WSA web scanning prevents access to
malicious websites and detects malware used
in these attacks. 
 
AMP Threat Grid helps identify malicious
binaries and build protection into all Cisco
Security products.
