September 2023 Threat Trend Report on Kimsuky Group 
5 
Overview 
The Kimsuky group's activities in September 2023 showed a notable surge in the 
RandomQuery type, while the activities of other types were relatively low or non-existent. 
 
Attack Statistics 
The number of fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) increased by 2 compared to August, but 
the activity of RandomQuery saw a sharp increase while the activity of BabyShark declined. 
Also, the number of AppleSeed type increased by 1 while no FlowerPower type was discovered. 
Ultimately, 11 instances of RandomQuery, 4 instances of AppleSeed, and 6 instances of 
BabyShark were discovered.

Major Issues 
1)  FlowerPower 
This type was not discovered in September. 
 
2)  RandomQuery 
(1) 
Script Fragmentation 
Although the ultimate malicious behaviors of this type remain largely unchanged, it is evident 
that it is undergoing another system change and in the process of fragmentation. A VBScript 
with new features has been discovered, and it performs different features based on the 
Windows OS version. 
 
When the Windows OS Version is prior to 10, the VBScript that uses the "list.php?qu=6" 
parameter to download additional files is dropped and registered to the scheduler to maintain 
persistence. It is worth noting here that instead of the original parameter "query=number", it 
now uses "qu=number". 
 
When the Windows OS Version is 10 or above, a PowerShell script that uses the 
"lib.php?ix=11" parameter to download additional files is saved and registered to the 
scheduler. When executed, the data of the additional file is decrypted using the 
Rfc2898DeriveBytes (PBKDF2) function and then run. 
 
Afterward, it uses the "lib.php?ix=1" parameter to download another additional script and 
decrypts the data using the Rfc2898DeriveBytes (PBKDF2) function before executing it. 
 
The shift from using the original parameter "query=number" to "qu=number" and 
"ix?=number" can be considered as an attempt to evade existing URL detections.

The script downloaded using the "lib.php?ix=11" parameter employs an internally 
implemented "GetTimeInterval" function to generate random numbers at intervals of 45 to 90 
minutes, with each interval being a multiple of 5 minutes. It then uses these numbers as C2 
connection parameters, which is presumed to be a means to replace the method of registering 
to the scheduler to maintain persistence. 
 
If an infected system uses "iv=55" as a parameter, this means that the infected system will 
wait for 55 minutes before reconnecting to the C2. Then, it uses the "lib.php?ix=5&iv=45-90" 
parameter to download and execute another additional script. This additionally downloaded 
script 
is 
a 
keylogging 
script 
that 
performs 
keylogging 
in 
the 
"%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Themes\" folder using the name "version.xml". 
 
September 2023 Threat Trend Report on Kimsuky Group 
10 
 
Figure 3. Portion of "lib.php?ix=11" script 
The script downloaded using the "lib.php?ix=1" parameter encrypts the drive information, 
system information, process information (tasklist and tasklist /svc), firewall information, 
installed anti-malware information, and lists of specific folders (Desktop, My Documents, 
Downloads, Recent Execution Paths, Startup, "C:\Program Files", and "C:\Program Files 
(x86)") with the Rfc2898DeriveBytes (PBKDF2) function before sending them to the C2 server.

11 
 
Figure 4. Portion of "lib.php?ix=1" script 
 
Ultimately, the data collection and keylogging behavior remains similar to the previous 
instances of RandomQuery. However, it is suspected that the script is fragmented for the 
purpose of hindering analysis by analysts and evading detection. 
 
Additionally, the system is being changed as the parameter format has shifted from 
"query=number" and "idx=number" to "qu=number" and "ix=number", as well as the addition 
of the "lib.php?ix=5&iv=45-90" parameter. However, it has been confirmed that both old and 
new formats are still being used in combination. 
 
The use of the Rfc2898DeriveBytes (PBKDF2) function was previously documented in the 
"February 2023 Threat Trend Report on Kimsuky Group5" released in March.

(2) 
Script Obfuscation 
In addition to fragmentation, the majority of scripts used by this type are obfuscated, 
indicating an intention to obstruct analysts and avoid detection. Among the samples obtained 
in September, the distribution of malicious LNK files is still being done through the 
"Compensation" form method which has been in use for some time. 
 
 
Figure 5. RAR file composition 
 
There is a malicious PowerShell script inside of the LNK file, but it has been obfuscated 
differently from before. The actual behavior is executed after the embedded bait document 
and VBScript are split based on certain offsets and dropped.

There are no special issues regarding this type aside from the detection of a number of FQDNs 
and samples.

There are no special issues for this type aside from the detection of an FQDN.
