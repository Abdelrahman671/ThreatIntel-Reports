A Curated Intelligence staff member - BushidoToken - recently uncovered new samples of
the HyperBro and SysUpdate backdoor, connected to the IronTiger APT group (also
known as LuckyMouse or APT27).

Just as before, the group uses multiple components: a genuine loader typically with
signed certification (here CyberArk Viewfinity); malicious DLL loader loaded from the
former component via DLL hijacking; encrypted and compressed blob (thumb.dat) that
decrypts to PE-based payload with C2 information (config.ini) hardcoded.
Analysis of the code-signing certificates
(Thumbprint: E5F7F5449C22F0A01DCFAC634732E2197AFCDD4C) used by IronTiger
revealed that the group used a certificate from Cheetah Mobile, a Chinese mobile Internet
company headquartered in Beijing.
Indicators of compromise (IOCs) are available on OTX Alienvault here.
