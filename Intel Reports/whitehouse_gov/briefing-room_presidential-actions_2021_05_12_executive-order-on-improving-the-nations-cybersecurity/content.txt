<p>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline">Section 1.  Policy. </span> The United States faces persistent and increasingly sophisticated malicious cyber campaigns that threaten the public sector, the private sector, and ultimately the American people&#8217;s security and privacy.  The Federal Government must improve its efforts to identify, deter, protect against, detect, and respond to these actions and actors.  The Federal Government must also carefully examine what occurred during any major cyber incident and apply lessons learned.  But cybersecurity requires more than government action.  Protecting our Nation from malicious cyber actors requires the Federal Government to partner with the private sector.  The private sector must adapt to the continuously changing threat environment, ensure its products are built and operate securely, and partner with the Federal Government to foster a more secure cyberspace.  In the end, the trust we place in our digital infrastructure should be proportional to how trustworthy and transparent that infrastructure is, and to the consequences we will incur if that trust is misplaced.<br><br>Incremental improvements will not give us the security we need; instead, the Federal Government needs to make bold changes and significant investments in order to defend the vital institutions that underpin the American way of life.  The Federal Government must bring to bear the full scope of its authorities and resources to protect and secure its computer systems, whether they are cloud-based, on-premises, or hybrid.  The scope of protection and security must include systems that process data (information technology (IT)) and those that run the vital machinery that ensures our safety (operational technology (OT)). <br><br>It is the policy of my Administration that the prevention, detection, assessment, and remediation of cyber incidents is a top priority and essential to national and economic security.  The Federal Government must lead by example.  All Federal Information Systems should meet or exceed the standards and requirements for cybersecurity set forth in and issued pursuant to this order.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 2.  Removing Barriers to Sharing Threat Information.</span><br>     (a)  The Federal Government contracts with IT and OT service providers to conduct an array of day-to-day functions on Federal Information Systems.  These service providers, including cloud service providers, have unique access to and insight into cyber threat and incident information on Federal Information Systems.  At the same time, current contract terms or restrictions may limit the sharing of such threat or incident information with executive departments and agencies (agencies) that are responsible for investigating or remediating cyber incidents, such as the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and other elements of the Intelligence Community (IC).  Removing these contractual barriers and increasing the sharing of information about such threats, incidents, and risks are necessary steps to accelerating incident deterrence, prevention, and response efforts and to enabling more effective defense of agencies&#8217; systems and of information collected, processed, and maintained by or for the Federal Government.<br>     (b)  Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence, shall review the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement contract requirements and language for contracting with IT and OT service providers and recommend updates to such requirements and language to the FAR Council and other appropriate agencies.  The recommendations shall include descriptions of contractors to be covered by the proposed contract language. <br>     (c)  The recommended contract language and requirements described in subsection (b) of this section shall be designed to ensure that:<br>          (i)    service providers collect and preserve data, information, and reporting relevant to cybersecurity event prevention, detection, response, and investigation on all information systems over which they have control, including systems operated on behalf of agencies, consistent with agencies&#8217; requirements;<br>          (ii)   service providers share such data, information, and reporting, as they relate to cyber incidents or potential incidents relevant to any agency with which they have contracted, directly with such agency and any other agency that the Director of OMB, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence, deems appropriate, consistent with applicable privacy laws, regulations, and policies;<br>          (iii)  service providers collaborate with Federal cybersecurity or investigative agencies in their investigations of and responses to incidents or potential incidents on Federal Information Systems, including by implementing technical capabilities, such as monitoring networks for threats in collaboration with agencies they support, as needed; and<br>          (iv)   service providers share cyber threat and incident information with agencies, doing so, where possible, in industry-recognized formats for incident response and remediation.<br>     (d)  Within 90 days of receipt of the recommendations described in subsection (b) of this section, the FAR Council shall review the proposed contract language and conditions and, as appropriate, shall publish for public comment proposed updates to the FAR.<br>     (e)  Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Director of OMB shall take appropriate steps to ensure to the greatest extent possible that service providers share data with agencies, CISA, and the FBI as may be necessary for the Federal Government to respond to cyber threats, incidents, and risks.<br>     (f)  It is the policy of the Federal Government that:<br>          (i)    information and communications technology (ICT) service providers entering into contracts with agencies must promptly report to such agencies when they discover a cyber incident involving a software product or service provided to such agencies or involving a support system for a software product or service provided to such agencies;<br>          (ii)   ICT service providers must also directly report to CISA whenever they report under subsection (f)(i) of this section to Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) Agencies, and CISA must centrally collect and manage such information; and <br>          (iii)  reports pertaining to National Security Systems, as defined in section 10(h) of this order, must be received and managed by the appropriate agency as to be determined under subsection (g)(i)(E) of this section.  <br>     (g)  To implement the policy set forth in subsection (f) of this section:<br>          (i) Within 45 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense acting through the Director of the National Security Agency (NSA), the Attorney General, and the Director of OMB, shall recommend to the FAR Council contract language that identifies:<br>              (A)  the nature of cyber incidents that require reporting;<br>              (B)  the types of information regarding cyber incidents that require reporting to facilitate effective cyber incident response and remediation;<br>              (C)  appropriate and effective protections for privacy and civil liberties;<br>              (D)  the time periods within which contractors must report cyber incidents based on a graduated scale of severity, with reporting on the most severe cyber incidents not to exceed 3 days after initial detection;<br>              (E)  National Security Systems reporting requirements; and<br>              (F)  the type of contractors and associated service providers to be covered by the proposed contract language.<br>          (ii)   Within 90 days of receipt of the recommendations described in subsection (g)(i) of this section, the FAR Council shall review the recommendations and publish for public comment proposed updates to the FAR.<br>          (iii)  Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Defense acting through the Director of the NSA, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence shall jointly develop procedures for ensuring that cyber incident reports are promptly and appropriately shared among agencies.<br>     (h)  Current cybersecurity requirements for unclassified system contracts are largely implemented through agency-specific policies and regulations, including cloud-service cybersecurity requirements.  Standardizing common cybersecurity contractual requirements across agencies will streamline and improve compliance for vendors and the Federal Government.<br>     (i)  Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Homeland Security acting through the Director of CISA, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense acting through the Director of the NSA, the Director of OMB, and the Administrator of General Services, shall review agency-specific cybersecurity requirements that currently exist as a matter of law, policy, or contract and recommend to the FAR Council standardized contract language for appropriate cybersecurity requirements.  Such recommendations shall include consideration of the scope of contractors and associated service providers to be covered by the proposed contract language.<br>     (j)  Within 60 days of receiving the recommended contract language developed pursuant to subsection (i) of this section, the FAR Council shall review the recommended contract language and publish for public comment proposed updates to the FAR.<br>     (k)  Following any updates to the FAR made by the FAR Council after the public comment period described in subsection (j) of this section, agencies shall update their agency-specific cybersecurity requirements to remove any requirements that are duplicative of such FAR updates.<br>     (l)  The Director of OMB shall incorporate into the annual budget process a cost analysis of all recommendations developed under this section.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"> Sec. 3.  Modernizing Federal Government Cybersecurity.</span><br>     (a)  To keep pace with today&#8217;s dynamic and increasingly sophisticated cyber threat environment, the Federal Government must take decisive steps to modernize its approach to cybersecurity, including by increasing the Federal Government&#8217;s visibility into threats, while protecting privacy and civil liberties.  The Federal Government must adopt security best practices; advance toward Zero Trust Architecture; accelerate movement to secure cloud services, including Software as a Service (SaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), and Platform as a Service (PaaS); centralize and streamline access to cybersecurity data to drive analytics for identifying and managing cybersecurity risks; and invest in both technology and personnel to match these modernization goals.<br>     (b)  Within 60 days of the date of this order, the head of each agency shall:<br>          (i)    update existing agency plans to prioritize resources for the adoption and use of cloud technology as outlined in relevant OMB guidance;<br>          (ii)   develop a plan to implement Zero Trust Architecture, which shall incorporate, as appropriate, the migration steps that the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) within the Department of Commerce has outlined in standards and guidance, describe any such steps that have already been completed, identify activities that will have the most immediate security impact, and include a schedule to implement them; and<br>          (iii)  provide a report to the Director of OMB and the Assistant to the President and National Security Advisor (APNSA) discussing the plans required pursuant to subsection (b)(i) and (ii) of this section.<br>     (c)  As agencies continue to use cloud technology, they shall do so in a coordinated, deliberate way that allows the Federal Government to prevent, detect, assess, and remediate cyber incidents.  To facilitate this approach, the migration to cloud technology shall adopt Zero Trust Architecture, as practicable.  The CISA shall modernize its current cybersecurity programs, services, and capabilities to be fully functional with cloud-computing environments with Zero Trust Architecture.  The Secretary of Homeland Security acting through the Director of CISA, in consultation with the Administrator of General Services acting through the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) within the General Services Administration, shall develop security principles governing Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) for incorporation into agency modernization efforts.  To facilitate this work:<br>          (i)    Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Director of OMB, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security acting through the Director of CISA, and the Administrator of General Services acting through FedRAMP, shall develop a Federal cloud-security strategy and provide guidance to agencies accordingly.  Such guidance shall seek to ensure that risks to the FCEB from using cloud-based services are broadly understood and effectively addressed, and that FCEB Agencies move closer to Zero Trust Architecture.<br>          (ii)   Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Homeland Security acting through the Director of CISA, in consultation with the Director of OMB and the Administrator of General Services acting through FedRAMP, shall develop and issue, for the FCEB, cloud-security technical reference architecture documentation that illustrates recommended approaches to cloud migration and data protection for agency data collection and reporting. <br>          (iii)  Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Homeland Security acting through the Director of CISA shall develop and issue, for FCEB Agencies, a cloud-service governance framework.  That framework shall identify a range of services and protections available to agencies based on incident severity.  That framework shall also identify data and processing activities associated with those services and protections.<br>          (iv)   Within 90 days of the date of this order, the heads of FCEB Agencies, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security acting through the Director of CISA, shall evaluate the types and sensitivity of their respective agency&#8217;s unclassified data, and shall provide to the Secretary of Homeland Security through the Director of CISA and to the Director of OMB a report based on such evaluation.  The evaluation shall prioritize identification of the unclassified data considered by the agency to be the most sensitive and under the greatest threat, and appropriate processing and storage solutions for those data.<br>     (d)  Within 180 days of the date of this order, agencies shall adopt multi-factor authentication and encryption for data at rest and in transit, to the maximum extent consistent with Federal records laws and other applicable laws.  To that end:<br>          (i)    Heads of FCEB Agencies shall provide reports to the Secretary of Homeland Security through the Director of CISA, the Director of OMB, and the APNSA on their respective agency&#8217;s progress in adopting multifactor authentication and encryption of data at rest and in transit.  Such agencies shall provide such reports every 60 days after the date of this order until the agency has fully adopted, agency-wide, multi-factor authentication and data encryption.<br>          (ii)   Based on identified gaps in agency implementation, CISA shall take all appropriate steps to maximize adoption by FCEB Agencies of technologies and processes to implement multifactor authentication and encryption for data at rest and in transit.<br>          (iii)  Heads of FCEB Agencies that are unable to fully adopt multi-factor authentication and data encryption within 180 days of the date of this order shall, at the end of the 180-day period, provide a written rationale to the Secretary of Homeland Security through the Director of CISA, the Director of OMB, and the APNSA.<br>     (e)  Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Homeland Security acting through the Director of CISA, in consultation with the Attorney General, the Director of the FBI, and the Administrator of General Services acting through the Director of FedRAMP, shall establish a framework to collaborate on cybersecurity and incident response activities related to FCEB cloud technology, in order to ensure effective information sharing among agencies and between agencies and CSPs.<br>     (f)  Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Administrator of General Services, in consultation with the Director of OMB and the heads of other agencies as the Administrator of General Services deems appropriate, shall begin modernizing FedRAMP by:<br>          (i)    establishing a training program to ensure agencies are effectively trained and equipped to manage FedRAMP requests, and providing access to training materials, including videos-on-demand;<br>          (ii)   improving communication with CSPs through automation and standardization of messages at each stage of authorization.  These communications may include status

Supply Chain Security.</span> <br>     (a)  The security of software used by the Federal Government is vital to the Federal Government&#8217;s ability to perform its critical functions.  The development of commercial software often lacks transparency, sufficient focus on the ability of the software to resist attack, and adequate controls to prevent tampering by malicious actors.  There is a pressing need to implement more rigorous and predictable mechanisms for ensuring that products function securely, and as intended.  The security and integrity of &#8220;critical software&#8221; &#8212; software that performs functions critical to trust (such as affording or requiring elevated system privileges or direct access to networking and computing resources) &#8212; is a particular concern.  Accordingly, the Federal Government must take action to rapidly improve the security and integrity of the software supply chain, with a priority on addressing critical software.<br>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 10.  Definitions.</span>  For purposes of this order:<br>    (a)  the term &#8220;agency&#8221; has the meaning ascribed to it under 44 U.S.C. 3502.<br>    (b)  the term &#8220;auditing trust relationship&#8221; means an agreed-upon relationship between two or more system elements that is governed by criteria for secure interaction, behavior, and outcomes relative to the protection of assets.<br>    (c)  the term &#8220;cyber incident&#8221; has the meaning ascribed to an &#8220;incident&#8221; under 44 U.S.C. 3552(b)(2).<br>    (d)  the term &#8220;Federal Civilian Executive Branch Agencies&#8221; or &#8220;FCEB Agencies&#8221; includes all agencies except for the Department of Defense and agencies in the Intelligence Community.  <br>    (e)  the term &#8220;Federal Civilian Executive Branch Information Systems&#8221; or &#8220;FCEB Information Systems&#8221; means those information systems operated by Federal Civilian Executive Branch Agencies, but excludes National Security Systems.<br>    (f)  the term &#8220;Federal Information Systems&#8221; means an information system used or operated by an agency or by a contractor of an agency or by another organization on behalf of an agency, including FCEB Information Systems and National Security Systems.<br>    (g)  the term &#8220;Intelligence Community&#8221; or &#8220;IC&#8221; has the meaning ascribed to it under 50 U.S.C. 3003(4).<br>    (h)  the term &#8220;National Security Systems&#8221; means information systems as defined in 44 U.S.C. 3552(b)(6), 3553(e)(2), and 3553(e)(3).<br>    (i)  the term &#8220;logs&#8221; means records of the events occurring within an organization&#8217;s systems and networks.  Logs are composed of log entries, and each entry contains information related to a specific event that has occurred within a system or network.<br>    (j)  the term &#8220;Software Bill of Materials&#8221; or &#8220;SBOM&#8221; means a formal record containing the details and supply chain relationships of various components used in building software.  Software developers and vendors often create products by assembling existing open source and commercial software components.  The SBOM enumerates these components in a product.  It is analogous to a list of ingredients on food packaging.  An SBOM is useful to those who develop or manufacture software, those who select or purchase software, and those who operate software.  Developers often use available open source and third-party software components to create a product; an SBOM allows the builder to make sure those components are up to date and to respond quickly to new vulnerabilities.  Buyers can use an SBOM to perform vulnerability or license analysis, both of which can be used to evaluate risk in a product.  Those who operate software can use SBOMs to quickly and easily determine whether they are at potential risk of a newly discovered vulnerability.   A widely used, machine-readable SBOM format allows for greater benefits through automation and tool integration.  The SBOMs gain greater value when collectively stored in a repository that can be easily queried by other applications and systems.  Understanding the supply chain of software, obtaining an SBOM, and using it to analyze known vulnerabilities are crucial in managing risk.<br>    (k)  the term &#8220;Zero Trust Architecture&#8221; means a security model, a set of system design principles, and a coordinated cybersecurity and system management strategy based on an acknowledgement that threats exist both inside and outside traditional network boundaries.  The Zero Trust security model eliminates implicit trust in any one element, node, or service and instead requires continuous verification of the operational picture via real-time information from multiple sources to determine access and other system responses.  In essence, a Zero Trust Architecture allows users full access but only to the bare minimum they need to perform their jobs.  If a device is compromised, zero trust can ensure that the damage is contained.  The Zero Trust Architecture security model assumes that a breach is inevitable or has likely already occurred, so it constantly limits access to only what is needed and looks for anomalous or malicious activity.  Zero Trust Architecture embeds comprehensive security monitoring; granular risk-based access controls; and system security automation in a coordinated manner throughout all aspects of the infrastructure in order to focus on protecting data in real-time within a dynamic threat environment.  This data-centric security model allows the concept of least-privileged access to be applied for every access decision, where the answers to the questions of who, what, when, where, and how are critical for appropriately allowing or denying access to resources based on the combination of sever.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 11.  General Provisions.</span>  <br>    (a)  Upon the appointment of the National Cyber Director (NCD) and the establishment of the related Office within the Executive Office of the President, pursuant to section 1752 of Public Law 116-283, portions of this order may be modified to enable the NCD to fully execute its duties and responsibilities.<br>    (b)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:<br>        (i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or<br>        (ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.<br>    (c)  This order shall be implemented in a manner consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.<br>    (d)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.<br>    (e)  Nothing in this order confers authority to interfere with or to direct a criminal or national security investigation, arrest, search, seizure, or disruption operation or to alter a legal restriction that requires an agency to protect information learned in the course of a criminal or national security investigation.<br>                       </p>
