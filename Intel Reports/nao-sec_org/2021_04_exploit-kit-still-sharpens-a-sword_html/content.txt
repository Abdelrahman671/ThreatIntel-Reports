<p>Note: This blog post doesn’t make sense to many</p>

<p>It’s 2021 now. Moreover, the quarter has already passed. I thought Drive-by Download attack was dead four years ago. Angler Exploit Kit has disappeared, pseudo-Darkleech and EITest campaign have disappeared, and RIG Exploit Kit has also declined. At that time, Drive-by Download attack was definitely supposed to die. However, even if in 2021, it will not disappear fire still slightly.</p>

<p>In April 2021, I received some incredible notices. For example, there are the following notifications.</p>

<ul>
  <li>PurpleFox Exploit Kit has started exploiting CVE-2021-26411</li>
  <li>RIG Exploit Kit has started exploiting CVE-2021-26411</li>
  <li>Bottle Exploit Kit is back, and has started exploiting CVE-2020-1380 and CVE-2021-26411</li>
  <li>Underminer Exploit Kit is back</li>
</ul>

<p>Repeat again. It’s 2021 now. Not 2017. Internet Explorer was taken away by Chrome and Edge, and Drive-by Download attack was supposed to die. Why are there still Drive-by Download attacks? Here are some reasons, including the opinions of your friends.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Internet Explorer is still used in some countries/regions including Japan</li>
  <li>Due to the influence of corona, remote work has increased, and the number of users with network security vulnerabilities has increased</li>
  <li>Internet Explorer vulnerabilities still discovered and exploit code published</li>
</ol>

<p>In reality, these are intricately intertwined, and there may be different reasons.</p>

<p>In any case, Drive-by Download attacks are still being observed. Moreover, it is a little more active. This is irrelevant for most people. Because most people don’t use Internet Explorer. If you don’t use Internet Explorer, a typical Exploit Kit attack is not a threat. A small number of targeted attacks may use Chrome’s 0day, which is not discussed here.</p>

<p>For the few enthusiastic Internet Explorer users that exist, I write this blog post. In other words, as of April 2021, I will introduce the characteristics of common Drive-by Download attacks that you may encounter. Thanks to my friends (@jeromesegura, @nao_sec members) for helping me write this blog post.</p>

<h2 id="exploit-kit-landscape">Exploit Kit Landscape</h2>
<p>As of April 2021, the following 6 types of Exploit Kits have been observed to be active.</p>

<ul>
  <li>RIG</li>
  <li>Spelevo</li>
  <li>PurpleFox</li>
  <li>Underminer</li>
  <li>Bottle</li>
  <li>Magnitude</li>
</ul>

<p>nao_sec has been running a fully automatic Drive-by Download attack observation environment called Augma System[1] for three years. The data observed by this is as follows. Some Exploit Kits are not counted because they are observed in different environments.</p>

<h2 id="finally">Finally</h2>
<p>Drive-by Download attacks are still observed in 2021. It has nothing to do with most people. As with Adobe Flash Player, stop using Internet Explorer immediately. That is the simplest solution. Drive-by Download attacks continue to exist with Internet Explorer.</p>
