Mitigations
• Update software, including operating systems, applications, and firmware, on IT network assets 
• Reviewing the CVEs for all Public Facing Systems – CISA regularly updates and maintains a full list of CVEs that are 
known to be exploited: CISA: Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog 
• Enforce MFA to the greatest extent possible and require accounts with password logins, including service accounts, to 
have strong passwords
• If you use RDP and/or other potentially risky services, secure and monitor them closely
• Provide end-user awareness and training to help prevent successful targeted social engineering and spear phishing 
campaigns
• As part of a longer-term effort, implement network segmentation to separate network segments based on role and 
functionality
• HHS 405(d) program provides the Healthcare and Public Health (HPH) sector with useful, impactful, and vetted 
resources, products, videos, and tools that help raise awareness and provide cybersecurity practices, which drive 
behavioral change and move toward consistency in mitigating the most relevant cybersecurity threats to the sector. 
They offer advice for small, medium, and large healthcare organizations: 405(d) Healtch Industry Cybersecurity 
Practices (HICP)
