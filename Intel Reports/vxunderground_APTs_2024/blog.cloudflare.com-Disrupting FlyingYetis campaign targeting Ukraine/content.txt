15 min read
Cloudforce One is publishing the results of our investigation and real-time effort to detect, deny, degrade, disrupt, and
delay threat activity by the Russia-aligned threat actor FlyingYeti during their latest phishing campaign targeting
Ukraine. At the onset of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, Ukraine introduced a moratorium on
evictions and termination of utility services for unpaid debt. The moratorium ended in January 2024, resulting in
significant debt liability and increased financial stress for Ukrainian citizens. The FlyingYeti campaign capitalized on
anxiety over the potential loss of access to housing and utilities by enticing targets to open malicious files via debt-
themed lures. If opened, the files would result in infection with the PowerShell malware known as COOKBOX,
allowing FlyingYeti to support follow-on objectives, such as installation of additional payloads and control over the
victim’s system.
Since April 26, 2024, Cloudforce One has taken measures to prevent FlyingYeti from launching their phishing
campaign – a campaign involving the use of Cloudflare Workers and GitHub, as well as exploitation of the WinRAR
vulnerability CVE-2023-38831. Our countermeasures included internal actions, such as detections and code
takedowns, as well as external collaboration with third parties to remove the actor’s cloud-hosted malware. Our
effectiveness against this actor prolonged their operational timeline from days to weeks. For example, in a single
instance, FlyingYeti spent almost eight hours debugging their code as a result of our mitigations. By employing
proactive defense measures, we successfully stopped this determined threat actor from achieving their objectives.
Executive Summary
On April 18, 2024, Cloudforce One detected the Russia-aligned threat actor FlyingYeti preparing to launch a
phishing espionage campaign targeting individuals in Ukraine.
We discovered the actor used similar tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) as those detailed in Ukranian
CERT's article on UAC-0149, a threat group that has primarily targeted Ukrainian defense entities with
COOKBOX malware since at least the fall of 2023.
2/9
From mid-April to mid-May, we observed FlyingYeti conduct reconnaissance activity, create lure content for use
in their phishing campaign, and develop various iterations of their malware. We assessed that the threat actor
intended to launch their campaign in early May, likely following Orthodox Easter.
After several weeks of monitoring actor reconnaissance and weaponization activity (Cyber Kill Chain Stages 1
and 2), we successfully disrupted FlyingYeti’s operation moments after the final COOKBOX payload was built.
The payload included an exploit for the WinRAR vulnerability CVE-2023-38831, which FlyingYeti will likely
continue to use in their phishing campaigns to infect targets with malware.
We offer steps users can take to defend themselves against FlyingYeti phishing operations, and also provide
recommendations, detections, and indicators of compromise.
Who is FlyingYeti?
FlyingYeti is the cryptonym given by Cloudforce One to the threat group behind this phishing campaign, which
overlaps with UAC-0149 activity tracked by CERT-UA in February and April 2024. The threat actor uses dynamic
DNS (DDNS) for their infrastructure and leverages cloud-based platforms for hosting malicious content and for
malware command and control (C2). Our investigation of FlyingYeti TTPs suggests this is likely a Russia-aligned
threat group. The actor appears to primarily focus on targeting Ukrainian military entities. Additionally, we observed
Russian-language comments in FlyingYeti’s code, and the actor’s operational hours falling within the UTC+3 time
zone.
Campaign background
In the days leading up to the start of the campaign, Cloudforce One observed FlyingYeti conducting reconnaissance
on payment processes for Ukrainian communal housing and utility services:
April 22, 2024 – research into changes made in 2016 that introduced the use of QR codes in payment notices
April 22, 2024 – research on current developments concerning housing and utility debt in Ukraine
April 25, 2024 – research on the legal basis for restructuring housing debt in Ukraine as well as debt involving
utilities, such as gas and electricity
Cloudforce One judges that the observed reconnaissance is likely due to the Ukrainian government’s payment
moratorium introduced at the start of the full-fledged invasion in February 2022. Under this moratorium, outstanding
debt would not lead to evictions or termination of provision of utility services. However, on January 9, 2024, the
government lifted this ban, resulting in increased pressure on Ukrainian citizens with outstanding debt. FlyingYeti
sought to capitalize on that pressure, leveraging debt restructuring and payment-related lures in an attempt to
increase their chances of successfully targeting Ukrainian individuals.
Analysis of the Komunalka-themed phishing site
The disrupted phishing campaign would have directed FlyingYeti targets to an actor-controlled GitHub page at
hxxps[:]//komunalka[.]github[.]io, which is a spoofed version of the Kyiv Komunalka communal housing site
https://www.komunalka.ua. Komunalka functions as a payment processor for residents in the Kyiv region and allows
for payment of utilities, such as gas, electricity, telephone, and Internet. Additionally, users can pay other fees and
fines, and even donate to Ukraine’s defense forces.
Based on past FlyingYeti operations, targets may be directed to the actor’s Github page via a link in a phishing email
or an encrypted Signal message. If a target accesses the spoofed Komunalka platform at
hxxps[:]//komunalka[.]github[.]io, the page displays a large green button with a prompt to download the document
“Рахунок.docx” (“Invoice.docx”), as shown in Figure 1. This button masquerades as a link to an overdue payment
invoice but actually results in the download of the malicious archive “Заборгованість по ЖКП.rar” (“Debt for housing
and utility services.rar”).
3/9
Figure 1: Prompt to download malicious archive “Заборгованість по ЖКП.rar”
A series of steps must take place for the download to successfully occur:
The target clicks the green button on the actor’s GitHub page hxxps[:]//komunalka.github[.]io
The target’s device sends an HTTP POST request to the Cloudflare Worker worker-polished-union-
f396[.]vqu89698[.]workers[.]dev with the HTTP request body set to “user=Iahhdr”
The Cloudflare Worker processes the request and evaluates the HTTP request body
If the request conditions are met, the Worker fetches the RAR file from
hxxps[:]//raw[.]githubusercontent[.]com/kudoc8989/project/main/Заборгованість по ЖКП.rar, which is then
downloaded on the target’s device
Cloudforce One identified the infrastructure responsible for facilitating the download of the malicious RAR file and
remediated the actor-associated Worker, preventing FlyingYeti from delivering its malicious tooling. In an effort to
circumvent Cloudforce One's mitigation measures, FlyingYeti later changed their malware delivery method. Instead of
the Workers domain fetching the malicious RAR file, it was loaded directly from GitHub.
Analysis of the malicious RAR file
During remediation, Cloudforce One recovered the RAR file “Заборгованість по ЖКП.rar” and performed analysis of
the malicious payload. The downloaded RAR archive contains multiple files, including a file with a name that contains
the unicode character “U+201F”. This character appears as whitespace on Windows devices and can be used to
“hide” file extensions by adding excessive whitespace between the filename and the file extension. As highlighted in
blue in Figure 2, this cleverly named file within the RAR archive appears to be a PDF document but is actually a
malicious CMD file (“Рахунок на оплату.pdf[unicode character U+201F].cmd”).
Figure 2: Files contained in the malicious RAR archive “Заборгованість по ЖКП.rar” (“Housing Debt.rar”)
FlyingYeti included a benign PDF in the archive with the same name as the CMD file but without the unicode
character, “Рахунок на оплату.pdf” (“Invoice for payment.pdf”). Additionally, the directory name for the archive once
decompressed also contained the name “Рахунок на оплату.pdf”. This overlap in names of the benign PDF and the
directory allows the actor to exploit the WinRAR vulnerability CVE-2023-38831. More specifically, when an archive
includes a benign file with the same name as the directory, the entire contents of the directory are opened by the
WinRAR application, resulting in the execution of the malicious CMD. In other words, when the target believes they
are opening the benign PDF “Рахунок на оплату.pdf”, the malicious CMD file is executed.
The CMD file contains the FlyingYeti PowerShell malware known as COOKBOX. The malware is designed to persist
on a host, serving as a foothold in the infected device. Once installed, this variant of COOKBOX will make requests to
4/9
the DDNS domain postdock[.]serveftp[.]com for C2, awaiting PowerShell cmdlets that the malware will subsequently
run.
Alongside COOKBOX, several decoy documents are opened, which contain hidden tracking links using the Canary
Tokens service. The first document, shown in Figure 3 below, poses as an agreement under which debt for housing
and utility services will be restructured.
Figure 3: Decoy document Реструктуризація боргу за житлово комунальні послуги.docx
The second document (Figure 4) is a user agreement outlining the terms and conditions for the usage of the payment
platform komunalka[.]ua.
Figure 4: Decoy document Угода користувача.docx (User Agreement.docx)
The use of relevant decoy documents as part of the phishing and delivery activity are likely an effort by FlyingYeti
operators to increase the appearance of legitimacy of their activities.
The phishing theme we identified in this campaign is likely one of many themes leveraged by this actor in a larger
operation to target Ukrainian entities, in particular their defense forces. In fact, the threat activity we detailed in this
blog uses many of the same techniques outlined in a recent FlyingYeti campaign disclosed by CERT-UA in mid-April
2024, where the actor leveraged United Nations-themed lures involving Peace Support Operations to target Ukraine’s
military. Due to Cloudforce One’s defensive actions covered in the next section, this latest FlyingYeti campaign was
prevented as of the time of publication.
Mitigating FlyingYeti activity
5/9
Cloudforce One mitigated FlyingYeti’s campaign through a series of actions. Each action was taken to increase the
actor’s cost of continuing their operations. When assessing which action to take and why, we carefully weighed the
pros and cons in order to provide an effective active defense strategy against this actor. Our general goal was to
increase the amount of time the threat actor spent trying to develop and weaponize their campaign.
We were able to successfully extend the timeline of the threat actor’s operations from hours to weeks. At each
interdiction point, we assessed the impact of our mitigation to ensure the actor would spend more time attempting to
launch their campaign. Our mitigation measures disrupted the actor’s activity, in one instance resulting in eight
additional hours spent on debugging code.
Due to our proactive defense efforts, FlyingYeti operators adapted their tactics multiple times in their attempts to
launch the campaign. The actor originally intended to have the Cloudflare Worker fetch the malicious RAR file from
GitHub. After Cloudforce One interdiction of the Worker, the actor attempted to create additional Workers via a new
account. In response, we disabled all Workers, leading the actor to load the RAR file directly from GitHub. Cloudforce
One notified GitHub, resulting in the takedown of the RAR file, the GitHub project, and suspension of the account
used to host the RAR file. In return, FlyingYeti began testing the option to host the RAR file on the file sharing sites
pixeldrain and Filemail, where we observed the actor alternating the link on the Komunalka phishing site between the
following:
hxxps://pixeldrain[.]com/api/file/ZAJxwFFX?download=one
hxxps://1014.filemail[.]com/api/file/get?filekey=e_8S1HEnM5Rzhy_jpN6nL-
GF4UAP533VrXzgXjxH1GzbVQZvmpFzrFA&pk_vid=a3d82455433c8ad11715865826cf18f6
We notified GitHub of the actor’s evolving tactics, and in response GitHub removed the Komunalka phishing site.
After analyzing the files hosted on pixeldrain and Filemail, we determined the actor uploaded dummy payloads, likely
to monitor access to their phishing infrastructure (FileMail logs IP addresses, and both file hosting sites provide view
and download counts). At the time of publication, we did not observe FlyingYeti upload the malicious RAR file to
either file hosting site, nor did we identify the use of alternative phishing or malware delivery methods.
A timeline of FlyingYeti’s activity and our corresponding mitigations can be found below.
