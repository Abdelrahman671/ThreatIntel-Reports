AridViper, an intrusion set allegedly associated with Hamas
⋮ 10/26/2023
Given the recent events involving the Palestinian politico-military organisation Hamas which conducted
on 7 October 2023 a military and terrorist operation in Israel, Sekoia.io took a deeper look into AridViper,
an intrusion set suspected to be associated with Hamas.
Context
Hamas, officially the Islamic Resistance Movement, is a Sunni-Islamic fundamentalist and nationalist
movement in Palestine. It is considered a terrorist organisation by the European Union. Hamas won the
2006 Palestinian legislative elections – the last held in the Palestinian territories – against its rival Fatah,
the historical Palestinian independence movement. 
Hamas is de facto the governing authority of the Gaza Strip since its takeover in June 2007, while the
Fatah-ruled Palestinian National Authority administers the Palestinian West Bank. Both movements are
in competition for the Palestinian independence leadership.
Hamas is supported by the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Lebanese-based Hezbollah movement, both
adversaries of Israel. Relations between Iran and Hamas consist of military, financial and political aid to
Hamas.

Background
AridViper, also known as APT C-23, MoleRATs, Gaza Cyber Gang or Desert Falcon, is an alleged
Hamas-associated intrusion set active since at least 2012. The group, first exposed by Trend Micro in
February 2015, was observed by multiple cybersecurity vendors carrying cyber espionage operations
on both Palestinian and foreign targets, mostly located in Israel and in the Middle-East. AridViper
leverages Windows-based, iOS and Android malwares.
In recent years, their malware arsenal was mainly designed to exfiltrate data from compromised hosts.
The group is known for its use of targeted phishing emails and fake social media profiles to entice targets
into installing malicious software on their devices.

Once the host is compromised, the attacker can download or upload arbitrary files onto the victim’s
system, capture data from input devices such as keyboards or microphones, and execute system
commands directly via a Command and Control (C2) server.
Since 2020, Arid Viper uses PyMICROPSIA Trojan, a Python-adapted version of the original Delphi-
based Micropsia, along with the Arid Gopher backdoor. Infections pathways employed by this group of
malware are documented, and their persistence throughout 2023 is attributed to the ongoing functionality
of their infrastructure. On October 6, 2023, in an abstract for a Virus Bulletin conference, ESET
announced the discovery of a new Rust-developed backdoor called Rusty Viper, suggesting that the
group continues to enhance its offensive capabilities.

AridViper’s victimology analysis 
The victimology presented here is based on the analysis of open source reports on AridViper APT or
MoleRATS, an intrusion set Sekoia.io assess to be an alias of the same group.
AridViper carrying operations on Israel and Middle-Eastern targets since at least 2015
AridViper was reported targeting multiple sectors based in the Middle-East, such as telecommunications,
insurance, retail, media, academics, high ranking military and government officials. The group mostly
impacted Israel, but operations targeting Arabic countries were also reported, including an organisation in
Bahrain, a media organisation in Algeria, as well as human rights activists and journalists in Turkey.
In 2015, a wide spearphishing campaign was observed by TrendMicro – dubbed AridViper Operation, the
alias then being used to follow the intrusion set – impacting an Israeli government office, a military
organisation and an academic institution in Tel Aviv, among others. In 2017 and 2020, Israel Defense
Force reported cyber espionage campaigns targeting Israeli soldiers, an operation CheckPoint
associated with AridViper activities. In 2022, Cyber Reason reported a campaign that targets Israeli
officials aiming to collect information from individuals working for law enforcement, military and
emergency services.
Sekoia.io assess it is likely AridViper contributes to Hamas efforts on intelligence collection about
its geopolitical adversaries, from strategic to operational espionage.

On another side, AridViper was observed carrying multiple operations targeting Palestinian entities.
Among the known targets are high value individuals working in the banking sector in Palestine, linked to
Palestinian political parties or involved in NGOs operating in Gaza and in the West Bank, as reported by
Zscaler in 2020.
Other campaigns were observed leveraging politically themed spearphishing related to geopolitical
conflicts between Israel and Palestine, targeting individuals located in Palestine, a focus confirmed by
Symantec in April 2023. For instance, some lures used by AridViper include topics such as the
assassination of Iranian general Qasem Soleimani in January 2020 or the ongoing conflict between
Hamas and Fatah movements.
Sekoia.io assess it is possible that AridViper contributes to Hamas surveillance intelligence against
political opposition within Palestine – on Fatah, Palestinian Authority, or any civil society entities –
NGO members or journalists susceptible to be critical against Hamas.

A related infrastructure still up nowadays
On 11 October 2023, Sekoia.io TDR analysts conducted an extended analysis on the command and
control (C2) infrastructure used by AridViper, based on indicators of compromise (IOC) previously
published by Symantec and CoreSec360.
We were able to find new exclusive domain names added to AridViper C2 infrastructure in 2023,
which are still active as of 24 October 2023. The domains are as follows, sorted by their first seen date
to an IPv4 address.

Based on the ‘first seen’ dates of the resolution of these domains on the listed IP addresses, Sekoia.io
analysts assess AridViper infrastructure continues to be regularly maintained and updated by its
operators. Off note, the domains sports-et-loisirs[.]net, im-inter[.]net and dslam[.]net are no longer active
as of 23 October 2023.
Among the domains uncovered by Sekoia.io investigation, some of them were previously exposed by
other cybersecurity vendors and are still active as of 24 October 2023:

Conclusion 
AridViper seems to be organised in two subgroups, one conducting cyber espionage activities towards
Israel and any entities in the Middle-East region susceptible to be involved in Palestine affairs, the
second focusing on surveillance activities towards Palestinian Hamas opposition including the Fatah
rival movement or individuals linked to the Palestinian Authority. 
Based on Sekoia.io technical investigation on AridViper infrastructure, we can confirm the group was
active the last months, and still currently operating, although we did not find any clues whether
AridViper increased its activities or not before and during the Hamas 7 October attack.
It is possible that the physical location of AridViper operators will be part of Israeli Air Force bombings,
as the Israeli military already conducted raids against objectives in the Gaza Strip that housed centres
for Hamas cyber operations in 2019 and 2021.
Based on the documented collaboration between Iran, Hamas and Lebanon-based Hezbollah, it is worth
questioning whether Iran, known for its cyber offensive capabilities and Israel targeting, collaborates
with AridViper or any Hamas cyber capacities, since Hezbollah-associated Polonium APT is suspected of
coordination with intrusion sets affiliated with Iran intelligence. To date, Sekoia.io did not find any
technical evidence in line with this hypothesis.
