CHINA
Multi-year Chinese APT 
Campaign Targets South Korean 
Academic, Government, and 
Political Entities
CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS
Executive Summary
Recorded Future’s Insikt Group analyzed a multi-year, Chinese state-sponsored cyber-espionage
campaign predominantly targeting South Korean academic, political, and government organizations.
This campaign, which we are tracking under the temporary group designator TAG-74 , has been publicly
1
linked to Chinese military intelligence and likely primarily poses a threat to academic, aerospace and
defense, government, military, and political organizations within South Korea, Japan, and Russia. This
assessment is based on the historical targeting pattern of this threat activity group and the typical area
of responsibility of People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Northern Theater Command-aligned threat actors.
In this campaign, we observed a particular focus on the targeting of South Korean academic entities.
The targeting of academia more generally fits within wider Chinese espionage efforts that serve
multiple purposes, including intellectual property (IP) theft and expanding Chinese Communist Party
(CCP) soft power and influence within higher education internationally. Business leaders in companies
engaging closely with academia in countries of strategic interest to Chinese intelligence services should
consider the business risks of both potential IP loss and academic institutions’ vulnerability to foreign
state influence that could lead to reputational damage through association.
More widely, intelligence collection within South Korea from Chinese state-sponsored actors is likely
driven by both regional proximity as well as the country’s strategic role in China's competition with the
United States (US) and other regional allies within the Indo-Pacific region. In recent months, Chinese
officials have been increasingly outspoken on South Korea’s perceived movement toward closer
relations with the US. Of particular note, in May 2023, a South Korean news outlet cited anonymous
“senior diplomatic officials” to report that China threatened to withhold cooperation with Seoul on North
Korea and other issues if South Korea continues crossing “red lines” related to South Korea “meddling
with Taiwan” or supporting “the US and Japan’s containment of China”. Notably, multiple observed
TAG-74 decoy documents and spoofed domains specifically related to inter-Korean cooperation and
reunification. These highlighted geopolitical tensions are likely to drive increased intelligence collection
efforts from Chinese state-sponsored threat activity groups such as TAG-74 against South Korean
public and private sector entities. This intelligence could be used to define Chinese diplomatic or
business engagement with South Korean entities, especially when foreign policy doesn't align with
Chinese strategic objectives.
Key Findings
●
TAG-74 is a Chinese state-sponsored threat activity group traditionally tasked with intelligence
collection against organizations within South Korea, Japan, and Russia. In the activity highlighted
1 TAG-74 overlaps with reported activity under the aliases Tonto Team, COPPER, CactusPete, Earth Akhlut, Karma Panda, and Bronze Huntley (1,
2), a group publicly linked to the People’s Liberation Army Strategic Support Force (PLASSF) former Shenyang Military Region Technical
Reconnaissance Bureau (now part of the Northern Theater Command) (1, 2).

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS
within this report, we observed the group predominantly targeting South Korean academic,
political, and government organizations.
●
The TTPs associated with this TAG-74 campaign include the use of .chm files that trigger a DLL
search order hijacking execution chain to load a customized version of the open-source,
lightweight, VBScript backdoor ReVBShell. We also identified multiple samples of the custom
backdoor Bisonal communicating to TAG-74 infrastructure; this backdoor is likely used to provide
additional capability after initial access is established through ReVBShell.
●
We assess that this customized ReVBShell variant is very likely shared by both TAG-74 and
another closely aligned PLASSF-linked threat activity group, Tick Group (BRONZE BUTLER,
Stalker Panda, Stalker Taurus). Tick Group’s use of this ReVBShell variant was previously
highlighted within ESET reporting. The use of shared capabilities and close collaboration
between Tick Group and TAG-74-linked activity has been previously observed and is
documented within public reporting (1, 2).

As shown in Figure 1, TAG-74 has been observed using a relatively consistent infection chain that has
slowly evolved since the first sighting of this activity in 2020. Elements of this TAG-74 activity have
been referenced in public reporting by Ahnlab (1, 2, 3, 4) and ESET. Typically, the group has used

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS
Compiled HTML (.chm) files likely distributed via spearphishing. These .chm files consist of 3 primary
components:
1.
An embedded legitimate executable that is vulnerable to DLL search order hijacking. Observed
executables used include the filenames vias.exe, LBTWiz32.exe,
PresentationSettings.exe, and ImagingDevices.exe.
2. A malicious DLL loaded via the accompanying legitimate executable via DLL search order
hijacking.
3. A HTML file that is used to:
○
display a decoy document to the user
○
execute a script to decompile the contents of the .chm file via the native Windows HTML
Help executable program (hh.exe)
○
execute the legitimate executable vulnerable to DLL search order hijacking, either directly
or via the RUN registry key
Figure 2: Example TAG-74 HTML file containing script to decompile .chm file and execute vias.exe (Source: Recorded Future)
The HTML file, as shown in Figure 2, includes a bitmap shortcut object which, when clicked, executes
the native HTML Help Windows binary hh.exe to decompile the .chm file and a second shortcut which
executes the legitimate executable vias.exe contained within the .chm. An embedded script then
uses the native HTML click() method to simulate a mouse-click on the first object, which executes
the first shortcut, waits 2 seconds, and then repeats this for the second object to trigger the DLL
search order hijacking chain.

Once loaded, the malicious DLL creates and executes a VBE file in the %TEMP% path. The decoded
VBE file is a customized version of the open-source VBscript backdoor ReVBShell, which is analyzed in
further detail in a later section of this report.
Infrastructure Analysis and Spoofing of South Korean Organizations
TAG-74 uses Virtual Private Server (VPS) infrastructure geolocated within South Korea and spread
across multiple hosting providers including AS-CHOOPA (AS20473), G-Core Labs (AS202422), EstNOC
OY (AS206804), and Korea Telecom (AS4766). The group heavily relies on dynamic DNS (DDNS)
domains for malware command-and-control (C2), which often spoof specific organizations within South
Korea. We observed the group using the IP addresses provided in Table 1 since the beginning of 2023;
Table 2 provides a sample of TAG-74 domains likely spoofing specific South Korean organizations. We
also identified repeated hosting overlap between newer TAG-74 DDNS domains active as recently as
June 2023 and those referenced in public reporting as far back as early 2020 (1, 2). Furthermore, April
2023 reporting by Ahnlab also highlighted an overlap with this group based on the observed usage of
Bisonal, although the report did not link this activity to the wider multi-year campaign described.
Notably, multiple decoy documents and spoofed domains observed by Recorded Future related to

Use of Open-Source ReVBShell Backdoor for Initial Access
As noted, TAG-74 has employed a slightly modified version of the open-source ReVBShell backdoor.
Modifications include additional functions responsible for:
●
Base64-encoding C2 traffic
●
Execution guardrails which, if ESET antivirus is detected on the infected host, set the C2 server
IP address 0.0.0[.]0 and the malware is exited
●
Additional commands or functions for code execution, changing the sleep interval, self-deletion,
and enumeration via WMI command-line (WMIC)
ReVBShell is configured to sleep for a specified interval (the default is 5 seconds) following a NOOP
response from the C2 server. In most cases, this sleep time is changed from the default 5 seconds to 5
minutes in observed TAG-74 activity. The TAG-74 variant also contains additional functionality to edit
this sleep interval via a C2 command.

Continued Usage of Flagship Malware Bisonal for Follow-on Activity
Insikt Group observed multiple Bisonal samples communicating with C2 infrastructure attributed to
TAG-74 (see Table 3). Bisonal is likely intended to be used as a follow-on malware family loaded after
initial access is established due to the additional functionality beyond the lightweight ReVBShell. Bisonal
is a long-running, custom backdoor exclusive to Chinese state-sponsored threat activity that has been
used in targeted intrusion activity primarily in Japan, South Korea, and Russia since at least 2010 (1, 2,
3, 4).

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS
Insikt Group conducted a comparative analysis of the payload loaded by the sample
11cd4b64dcac3195c01ffc937ae1eb77aa2f98d560a75347036d54a1cf69a5fd listed in Table 3,
and identified close similarities with a variant of Bisonal reported by NTT Security in 2020. The sample
we analyzed had the following commands, which closely align with the variant analyzed by NTT
Security (page 27):
●
Change prefix of sending data (unknown and unknown2 fields inside the payload struct in Figure
6)
●
Send process information
●
Send drive list
●
Send file information
●
Process termination
●
Execute command
●
File download
●
File upload
●
Delete file
●
Recreate socket
●
Sending socket objects
●
File execution
The sample analyzed by Insikt Group also uses the same string decryption algorithm and reuses the
1213 key highlighted within the NTT Security Bisonal research (page 28). Additionally, the magic bytes
0A 1B 2C 3D referenced in the NTT Security analysis on one of the Bisonal variants’ C2
communications (page 64) matched both of the analyzed samples.
The second sample in Table 3
(01e5ebc2c096d465800660a0ad6d62208a5b2b675e3700f3734fac225b1d38bd), is packed using
VMProtect and loads a Bisonal payload very similar to the first. Example C2 communications for this
sample are shown in Figure 5 — this includes the magic bytes 0A 1B 2C 3D alongside basic victim
information such as computer name, user name, operating system IP address, and a campaign/target
code, as also shown in Figure 6. This communication structure matches that of the first sample.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS
The payloads loaded by the other 3 samples in Table 3 all contain the characteristic marker string
bisonal, which was not present in the other 2 analyzed samples. The presence of this marker string
appears to vary based on the variant of Bisonal in use, which has evolved significantly over the past
decade.
Mitigations
Users should conduct the following measures to detect and mitigate activity associated with TAG-74
activity:
●
Configure your intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention systems (IPS), or any
network defense mechanisms in place to alert on — and, upon review, consider blocking
connection attempts to and from — the external IP addresses and domains linked in Appendix A.
●
Organizations should consider blocking .chm and other low-legitimate-use file attachments at
email gateways and through application deny lists where possible, given the propensity of abuse
and low prevalence of legitimate use in most environments.
●
Recorded Future proactively detects and logs malicious server configurations in the Command
and Control Security Control Feed. The Command and Control list includes both open-source
and customized tools used by Chinese state-sponsored threat activity groups, such as
ReVBShell. Recorded Future clients should alert on and block these C2 servers to allow for
detection and remediation of active intrusions.
●
Since multiple state-sponsored and financially motivated threat activity groups continue to use
DDNS domains in network intrusion activity, all TCP/UDP network traffic involving DDNS
subdomains should be blocked and logged (using DNS RPZ or similar).
●
Monitor for domain abuse, such as typosquat domains spoofing your organization, through the
Recorded Future Brand Intelligence module.
Outlook
The observed TAG-74 campaign is indicative of the group’s long-term intelligence collection objectives
against South Korean targets. Given the group’s persistent focus on South Korean organizations over
many years and the likely operational purview of the Northern Theater Command, the group is likely to
continue to be highly active in conducting long-term intelligence-gathering on strategic targets within
South Korea as well as in Japan and Russia.
The use of .chm files by Chinese state-sponsored actors is not particularly common outside of South
Korea but has been seen both in TAG-74 campaigns and in activity attributed to North Korean
state-sponsored threat activity groups, such as Kimsuky and APT37, in activity targeting South Korea
(1, 2). Network defenders should consider monitoring for the presence and use of .chm files, especially
if they are not typically used within their environment. Generally, the use of more unusual file types for
initial access, such as .chm, has increased in prevalence following a shift away from macro usage by
threat actors throughout 2022 and 2023.
