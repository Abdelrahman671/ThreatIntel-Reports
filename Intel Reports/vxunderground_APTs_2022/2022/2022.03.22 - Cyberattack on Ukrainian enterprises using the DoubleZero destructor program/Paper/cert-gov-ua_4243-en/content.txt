Cyberattack on Ukrainian enterprises using the DoubleZero
destructor program (CERT-UA # 4243)
General Information
On March 17, 2022, the government team responding to computer emergencies in Ukraine CERT-UA
discovered several ZIP archives, one of which was called "Virus ... extremely dangerous !!!. Zip". Each of
the archives contains an obfuscated .NET program. As a result of the analysis, the identified programs
are classified as DoubleZero - a malicious destructor program developed using the C # programming
language. It uses two methods to destroy files: overwriting files with zero blocks of 4096 bytes
(FileStream.Write method) or using API-calls NtFileOpen, NtFsControlFile (code:
FSCTL_SET_ZERO_DATA). First, all non-system files on all disks are overwritten. After that the list of
system files on a mask is made, their sorting and the subsequent rewriting in the corresponding
sequence is carried out. The following branches of the Windows registry are destroyed: HKCU, HKU,
HKLM, HKLM \ BCD. Finally, the computer shuts down.
The activity is tracked by the UAC-0088 identifier and is directly related to attempts to violate the regular
mode of operation of information systems of Ukrainian enterprises.
