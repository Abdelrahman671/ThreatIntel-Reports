X_Trader Supply Chain Attack Affects Critical Infrastructure
Organizations in U.S. and Europe
The X_Trader software supply chain attack affected more organizations than 3CX. Initial investigation by
Symantec’s Threat Hunter Team has, to date, found that among the victims are two critical infrastructure
organizations in the energy sector, one in the U.S. and the other in Europe. In addition to this, two other
organizations involved in financial trading were also breached.
As reported yesterday by Mandiant, Trojanized X_Trader software was the cause of the 3CX breach,
which was uncovered last month. As a result of this breach, 3CX’s software was compromised, with many
customers inadvertently downloading malicious versions of the company’s voice and video calling
software DesktopApp. In addition to wider victims, Symantec has also discovered additional indicators of
compromise, listed below.
It appears likely that the X_Trader supply chain attack is financially motivated, since Trading
Technologies, the developer of X_Trader, facilitates futures trading, including energy futures.
Nevertheless, the compromise of critical infrastructure targets is a source of concern. North Korean-
sponsored actors are known to engage in both espionage and financially motivated attacks and it cannot
be ruled out that strategically important organizations breached during a financial campaign are targeted
for further exploitation.
Malicious Installer
2/4
The infection chain starts with the Trojanized installer named X_TRADER_r7.17.90p608.exe (SHA256:
900b63ff9b06e0890bf642bdfcbfcc6ab7887c7a3c057c8e3fd6fba5ffc8e5d6), which is digitally signed by
"Trading Technologies International, Inc." and contains a malicious executable named Setup.exe. Our
analysis of one version of this executable (SHA256:
aa318070ad1bf90ed459ac34dc5254acc178baff3202d2ea7f49aaf5a055dd43) found that when executed,
it examined the file named X_TRADER-ja.mst (also contained in the installer) for the following marker
bytes at hardcoded offset 0x167000:
5E DA F3 76
If the marker bytes are present, it creates a folder named:
C:\Programdata\TPM
It then copies the file C:\Windows\Sysnative\immersivetpmvscmgrsvr.exe as
C:\Programdata\TPM\TpmVscMgrSvr.exe to the new folder.
Next, it will drop two malicious DLLs:
C:\Programdata\TPM\winscard.dll (SHA256:
cc4eedb7b1f77f02b962f4b05278fa7f8082708b5a12cacf928118520762b5e2)
C:\Programdata\TPM\msvcr100.dll (SHA256:
d937e19ccb3fd1dddeea3eaaf72645e8cd64083228a0df69c60820289b1aa3c0)
The content of the dropped files is generated by decrypting chunks of the file X_TRADER-ja.mst
mentioned earlier using the XOR algorithm with the following key:
74 F2 39 DA E5 CF
To achieve persistence on the victim’s system, the malware invokes a CLSID_TaskScheduler COM
object, possibly to create a scheduled task to run periodically the following file:
C:\Programdata\TPM\TpmVscMgrSvr.exe
Setup.exe then drops a file named X_TRADER.exe, also contained within the installer. The content of the
dropped file is generated by decrypting chunks from one of its own portable executable resources starting
at hardcoded offset 0x1CB40 using the XOR algorithm with the following key:
74 F2 39 DA E5 CF
Setup will then execute X_Trader.exe before deleting itself.
Backdoor Installation
Once installed, the legitimate X_Trader executable side-loads the two malicious DLLs dropped by the
installer. The first, winscard.dll, acts as a loader and contains code that will load and execute a payload
from the second (msvcr100.dll). The msvcr100.dll file contains an encrypted blob appended to the file.
The blob starts with the hex value FEEDFACE, which the loader uses to find the blob.
3/4
The process for payload installation is almost identical as that seen with the Trojanized 3CX app, where
two side-loaded DLLs are used to extract a payload from an encrypted blob.
In this attack, the payload extracted is a modular backdoor called Veiledsignal (SHA256:
e185c99b3d1085aed9fda65a9774abd73ecf1229f14591606c6c59e9660c4345). Veiledsignal contains
another DLL (SHA256: 19442d9e476e3ef990ce57b683190301e946ccb28fc88b69ab53a93bf84464ae),
which is a process-injection module. This can be injected into the Chrome, Firefox, or Edge web
browsers. The module contains a second DLL (SHA256:
f8c370c67ffb3a88107c9022b17382b5465c4af3dd453e50e4a0bd3ae9b012ce), which is a command-and-
control (C&C) module. It connects to the following C&C URL:

Hydra-like Campaign
The discovery that 3CX was breached by another, earlier supply chain attack made it highly likely that
further organizations would be impacted by this campaign, which now transpires to be far more wide-
ranging than originally believed. The attackers behind these breaches clearly have a successful template
for software supply chain attacks and further, similar attacks cannot be ruled out.
