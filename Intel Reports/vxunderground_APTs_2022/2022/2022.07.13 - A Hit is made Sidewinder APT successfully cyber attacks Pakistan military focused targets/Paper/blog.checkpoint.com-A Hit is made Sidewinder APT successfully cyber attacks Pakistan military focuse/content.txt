A Hit is made: Sidewinder APT successfully cyber attacks Pakistan
military focused targets
⋮ 6/20/2022
Check Point Research (CPR) reported evidence suggesting that Pakistan Air Force’s Headquarters was a victim of a
successful attack conducted by Sidewinder, a suspected India hacker’s APT group.
During May 2022, several malware samples and two encrypted files, related to the attack were uploaded to Virus
Total. After decrypting the encrypted files, CPR saw that one of them is a .NET DLL related to an APT group called
“Sidewinder” that is attributed to India based hackers, and known to target entities in Pakistan. The malware utilized
in this espionage operation is an information stealer malware, exclusively used by this APT, usually leveraged to steal
documents from the following types: .docx .doc .xls .xlsx .pdf .ppt .pptx .rar .zip.
The second file CPR decrypted was highly meaningful. It was produced by the information-stealer malware and
contained a list of all the relevant files on the infected computer. Looking at the collected names, CPR found a
mixture of files relating to different topics, most of which are related to military and aeronautics, with the remaining on
communication, nuclear facilities, higher education, war history, architecture and electricity. In addition, some file
paths pointed to documents from “Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee’, reportedly the highest ranking officer in
Pakistan’s military. Overall many file paths in file (about 20,000 file names) were discovered, with the weight of 2MB
suggesting an infected machine was used, or had access, to a drive mutual to multiple people within the organization.
From the names of the files and directories, we can also learn about usernames which belongs to the victim,
including AHQ-STRC3. This, in addition to other elements in the file names, seems to suggest that  AHQ stands for
Air Headquarters Pakistan which is the headquarters for the Pakistan Air Force. There are also documents that
explicitly mention Air Headquarters in their file names, strengthening the link between the ‘AHQ’ in the username to
the Pakistan Airforce. Investigations found an additional username called “gnss” which unfortunately didn’t produce
any useful leads, though another guess might be that this refers to “Global navigation satellite system”. The files
seen also had names relating to satellite communication, implying data around this.
While the analysis of malware files uploaded to Virus Total often reveals the identity of the targets of the attack
campaign, it is uncommon to also expose evidence that the attack was actually successful. In this case, CPR saw
2/3
that a log file, produced by the malware, exposed the identity of the victims, including names of sensitive documents
and systems.
This leads CPR to assume that the intrusion was eventually detected and analyzed by the victim or security analysts
operating on its behalf.
SideWinder : Suspected Indian based APT Group
SideWinder is an APT group that strongly focuses on Pakistan and China government organizations. At the end of
March, 2022, CPR published an analysis of SideWinder’s malicious document, which exploited the Russia-Ukraine
conflict. Judging by its content, the intended targets of the attack were Pakistani entities; the bait document contains
the document of National Institute of Maritime Affairs of Bahria University in Islamabad, and is titled “Focused talk on
Russian Ukraine Conflict Impact on Pakistan.”
Decoy document related to Russia-Ukraine war, from previous attack by Sidewinder APT
Check Point will continue to track the threat landscape, hunt for new intrusions and protect Check Point’s customers
from Advanced Persistent Threats.
