On November 21st #ESETResearch detected and 
alerted 
 of a wave of ransomware we 
named #RansomBoggs, deployed in multiple 
organizations in Ukraine
. While the malware written 
in .NET is new, its deployment is similar to previous 
attacks attributed to #Sandworm. 1/9

Its authors make multiple references to Monsters, Inc., the 2001 movie by 
Thread
Pixar. The ransom note (SullivanDecryptsYourFiles.txt) shows the authors 
impersonate James P. Sullivan, the main character of the movie, whose job 
is to scare kids. 2/9

There are similarities with previous attacks conducted by #Sandworm: a 
PowerShell script used to distribute the .NET ransomware from the domain 
controller is almost identical to the one seen last April during the 
#Industroyer2 attacks against the energy sector. 4/9

This PowerShell script is what 
 calls #POWERGAP, and was 
used to deploy #CaddyWiper using #ArguePatch (see 
cert.gov.ua/article/39518). 5/9

RansomBoggs generates a random key and encrypts files using AES-256 in 
CBC mode (not AES-128 like mentioned in the ransom note), and appends 
the .chsch file extension. The key is then RSA encrypted and written to 
aes.bin. 6/9

Depending on the malware variant, the RSA public key can either be 
hardcoded in the malware sample itself or provided as argument. 7/9

Last month, Microsoft notified about a similar operation in Ukraine and 
Poland, where  ransomware called #Prestige hit logistics companies. They 
also attributed these attacks to #Sandworm. 8/9

Microsoft has identified a new ransomware strain "Prestige" in limited 
targeted attacks in Ukraine and Poland. Several notable features 
differentiate this ransomware from other campaigns and payloads 
tracked by MSTIC. Get TTPs and protection info: msft.it/6013duZQz
