•Introduction
•Red Apollo and MS13-098
•Red Kelpie
•Malware analysis
•Motnug + ChaChaLoader
•Cobalt Strike + SideWalk
•Infrastructure analysis
•Targeting and attribution
•Further researchIndicators + YARA rules + Scripts:https://github.com/PwCUK-CTO/TheSAS2021-Red-Kelpie
•DESLoader/SigLoader/HEAVYHAND
•Loads a variety of malware families: 
•SodaMaster/DelfsCake/HEAVYPOT
•P8RAT/GreetCake
•Cobalt Strike
•Abuses MS13-098to store encrypted payloadsSHA-256

Win64 DLLFile size
190,464 bytesSample DESLoaderhash:
•Look for signed binaries with organisation “
Microsoft Corporation”, and common name “
Microsoft Windows”
•Find the last occurrence of “
Microsoft Time-Stamp PCA”, and check it is within “
IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_SECURITY”
•Check that from the end of this timestamp the rest of this section is greater than 5KB (i.e. there is extra data at the end of the digital signature)
•Finally, check that this extra data has high entropyAlternatively, @Int2e_ has a similar rule:https://twitter.com/Int2e_/status/1330975808941330432
•Rule works nicely, picks up a bunch of extra Red Apollo samples
•Can't confirm all of them without the loaders
•Then picks up a MS13-098 sample that is loaded by a different loader than DESLoader…
•Appears related to APT41during initial analysis, specifically the MotnugloaderNote: timing of MS13-098 samples observed suggests Red Apollo used this technique firstFirst Red Apollo sample: seen 9thJuly 2020First Red Kelpie sample: seen 12thNovember 2020
•China-based threat actor
•Aliases*:APT41, BARIUM
•Targets:Telecommunications, technology, manufacturing, financial services, etc.
•Tools: CROSSWALK, ShadowPad, Motnug, and many more*Note: these are not 1:1 mappings of the threat actor, this is based on our visibility
•Loader used by Red Kelpie since at least 2019
•Named Motnugby ESET
•Known to load CROSSWALK
•Can either load a file from itself, or from another file on disk
•Decrypt payloads via AES-128 CBC, or custom ChaCha20 routineSHA-256

Win64 DLLFile size
101,376 bytesSample hash:
•ChaCha20 counter manually set to a value higher than 0
•Not all ChaCha20 implementations allow for manual setting of the counter
•Hacky approach: feed n64-byte blocks in, where nis the counter you want to set
•Some variants contain a guardrail to stop Motnugexecuting if it fails
•If the year is greater than 2021, or less than 2019, the loader will not execute
•Called StealthVectorby Trend Micro
•Abuses MS13-098 (how I found it initially)
•Updated version of Motnug?
•Same custom ChaCha20 routine
•Very similar custom API structure
•All compilation timestamps after Motnug
•Extra features in the loader (more anti-analysis)
•More customisable configurationSHA-256
