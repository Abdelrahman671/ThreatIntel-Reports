TLP:CLEAR  Purpose  
The authoring agencies developed this document  in furtherance of their respective cybersecurity missions, 
including their responsibilities to develop and issue cybersecurity specifications and mitigations.  
Technical Details  
Key Findings  
In 2023, malicious cyber actors exploited more zero -day vulnerabilities to compromise enterprise networks 
compared to 2022, allowing them to conduct cyber operations against higher -priority targets. In 2023, the 
majority of the  most frequently exploited vu lnerabilities were initially exploited as a zero -day, which is a n 
increase from 2022, when less than half  of the top exploited vulnerabilities were exploited as a zero -day.  
Malicious cyber actors continue to have the most success exploiting vulnerabilitie s within two years after 
public disclosure of the vulnerability. The utility of these vulnerabilities declines over time as more systems 
are patched or replaced.  Malicious cyber actors find less utility from zero -day exploits when  international 
cybersecuri ty efforts reduce the lifespan of zero -day vulnerabilities.  
Cybersecurity Efforts to Include  
Implementing  security -centered product development lifecycles . Software developers  deploying patches to 
fix software vulnerabilities is often a lengthy and expensive process, particularly for zero -days. The use of 
more robust testing environments and implementing threat modeling throughout the product development 
lifecycle will likely reduce overall product vulnerabilities.  
Increasing incentives for responsib le vulnerability disclosure. Global efforts to reduce barriers to 
responsible vulnerability disclosure could restrict the utility of zero-day exploits used by malicious cyber 
actors. For example, instituting  vulnerability reporting bug bounty programs that  allow researchers to 
receive compensation and re cognition  for their contributions to vulnerability research  may boost 
disclosures.  
Using sophisticated endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools. End users leveraging EDR solutions may  
improve the detection rate of zero -day exploits. Most zero -day exploits, including at least three of the top 
15 vulnerabilities from last year, have been discovered when an end user or EDR system reports 
suspicious activity or unusual device malfunctions.

TLP:CLEAR  Mitigations  
Vendors and Devel opers  
The authoring agencies  recommend vendors  and developers  take the following steps  to help ensure their 
products are secure by design and default : 
 Identify repeatedly exploited classes of vulnerability.  
○ Perform an analysis of both CVEs and known exploited vulnerabilities  (KEVs)  to understand 
which classes of vulnerability are identified more than others.  
○ Implement appropriate mitigations to eliminate those classes of vulnerability.  
○ If a product has several instances of SQL injection vulnerabilities, ensure all database queries 
in the product use parameterized queries and prohibit other forms of que ries. 
 Ensure business leaders are responsible for security.  
○ Business leaders should ensure their teams take proactive steps to eliminate entire classes of 
security vulnerabilities, rather than only making one -off patches when new vulnerabilities are 
discovered.  
 Follow SP 800 -218 SSDF and implement secure by design practices into each stage of the SDLC ; 
in particular, aim to perform the following  SSDF  recommendations : 
○ Prioritiz e the use of memory safe languages wherever possible [ SSDF PW 6.1 ]. 
○ Exercis e due diligence when selecting software components (e.g., software libraries, modules, 
middleware, frameworks)  to ensure robust security in consumer software products  [SSDF PW 
4.1]. 
○ Set up secure software  development team practices —this includes c onducting peer code 
reviews , work ing to a common organization secure coding standard, and maintaining 
awareness of language -specific se curity concerns  [SSDF  PW.5.1, PW.7.1, PW.7.2 ]. 
○ Establish a vulnerability disclosure program  to verify and resolve security v ulnerabilities 
disclosed by people who may be internal or external to the organization [ SSDF RV.1.3 ] and 
establish processes to determine root causes of discovered vulnerabilities.  
○ Use static and dynamic application security testing (SAST/DAST) tools to analyze product 
source code and application behavior to detect error -prone practices [SSDF PW.7.2, PW.8.2 ]. 
 Configur e production -ready product s to have the most secure settings by default  and provi de 
guidance on the risks of changing each setting [ SSDF PW.9.1, PW9.2 ]. 
○ Prioritize secure  by default configurations  such as eliminat ing default passwords, implementing 
single sign on (SSO) technology via modern open standards, and providing high -quality audit 
logs to customers with no additional configuration necessary and at no extra charge.  
 Ensure published CVEs include the proper  CWE field identifying the root cause of the vulnerability  
to enable industry -wide analysis of software security and design flaws .

recommended  secure  by default configurations,  see CISA’s joint guide Shifting the Balance of 
Cybersecurity Risk: Principles and Approaches for Security  by Design and Default . 
End- User Organizations 
The authoring agencies recommend end -user organizations implement the mitigations below to improve 
their cybersecurity posture based on  threat actors’ activity. These mitigations align with the cross -sector 
Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs)  developed by CISA and the National Institute of Standards and 
Technology (NIST). The CPGs provide a minimum set of practices and protections that CISA and NIST 
recommend all organizations implement. CISA and NIST based t he CPGs on existing cybersecurity 
frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful threats, tactics, techniques, 
and procedures. Visit CISA’s  CPGs webpa ge for more information on CPGs, including additional 
recommended baseline protections.  
Vulnerability and Configuration Management  
 Update software, operating systems, applications, and firmware on IT network assets in a t imely 
manner  [CPG 1.E].  
○ Prioritize patching KEVs , especially those CVEs identified in this advisory , then critical and high 
vulne rabilities that allow for remote code execution or denial -of-service on internet -facing 
equipment.  
○ For patch information on CVEs identified in this advisory , refer to the  Appendix: Patch 
Information and Additional Resources for Top Exploited Vulnerabilitie s. 
● If a patch for a KEV or critical vulnerability cannot be quickly applied, implement vendor -
approved workarounds.  
● Replace end -of-life software (i.e., software no longer supported by the vendor ). 
 Routinely perform automated asset discovery  across the enti re estate to identify and catalogue all 
the systems, services, hardware , and software.  
 Implement a robust patch management process and centralized patch management system that 
establishes prioritization of patch applications  [CPG 1.A ]. 
○ Organizations that are unable to perform rapid scanning  and patching of internet -facing 
systems should consider moving  these services to mature, reputable cloud service providers 
(CSPs) or other managed  service providers ( MSPs). 
○ Reputable MSPs can patch applications  (such as webmail, file storage, file sharing, chat , and 
other employee collaboration tools ) for their customers.  
Note:  MSPs and CSPs can expand the ir customer’s attack surface and may introduce 
unanticipated risks, so organizations should proactively collaborate with their MSPs and CSPs 
to jointly reduce risk  [CPG 1.F ]. For more information and guidance, see  the following 
resources :

TLP:CLEAR  ● CISA Insights ’ Mitigations and Hardening Guidance for MSPs and Small - and Mid -sized 
Businesses . 
● ACSC’s  How to Manage Your Security When Engaging a MSP . 
 Document secure baseline configurations for all IT/OT components , including cloud infrastructure.  
○ Monitor, examine, and document any deviations from the initial secure bas eline [CPG 2.O ]. 
 Perform regular secure system backups  and create known  good copies of all device configurations 
for repairs and/or restoration.  
○ Store copies off -network in physically secure locations and test regularly  [CPG 2.R ]. 
 Maintain a n updated cybersecurity incident response plan  that  is tested at least annually and 
updated within a risk informed time frame to ensure its effectiveness  [CPG 2.S ]. 
Identity and Access Management  
 Enforce phishing -resistant  multifactor authentication (MFA) for all users  without exception  [CPG 
2.H]. 
 Enforce  MFA on all VPN connections . 
○ If MFA is unavailable, require employees engaging in  remote work to use strong passwords  
[CPG 2.A , 2.B , 2.C , 2.D, 2.G ]. 
 Regularly review, validate, or remove unprivileged  accounts  (annually at a minimum)  [CPG 2.D , 
2.E]. 
 Configure access control under the principle of least privilege  [CPG 2.O ]. 
○ Ensure software service accounts only provide necessary permissions (least privilege) to 
perform intende d functions (using non -administrative privileges where feasible).  
Note:  See CISA ’s Capacity Enhancement Guide – Implementing Strong Au thentication  and 
ACSC’s  guidance on Implementing MFA for more information on authentication system  
hardening . 
Protective Controls and Architecture  
 Properly configure and secure internet -facing network devices , disable unused or unnecessary 
network ports and protocols, encrypt network traffic, and disable unused network services and 
devices  [CPG 2.V , 2.W , 2.X]. 
○ Harden commonly exploited enterprise network services, including Link -Local Multicast Name 
Resolution (LLMNR) protocol, Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), Common Internet File System 
(CIFS), Active Directory, and OpenLDAP . 
○ Manage Windows Key Distribution Center (KDC) accounts ( e.g., KRBTGT) to minimize Gold en 
Ticket attacks and Kerbero asting . 
○ Strictly control the use of native scripting applications , such as  command -line, PowerShell, 
WinRM, Windows Management Instrumentation ( WMI), and Distributed Component Object 
Model  (DCOM ).

TLP:CLEAR   Implement Zero Trust Network Architecture (ZTNA)  to limit or block lateral movement by controlling 
access to applications , devices, and  databases. Use private virtual local area networks [ CPG 2.F , 
2.X]. 
Note:  See CISA’s Zero Trust Maturity Model  and the Department of Defense’s Zero Trust Reference 
Architecture  for additional information on Zero Trust.  
 Continuously monitor  the attack surface  and investigate abnormal activity that may indicate cyber 
actor or malware lateral movement  [CPG 2. T]. 
○ Use security tools, such as endpoint detection and response (EDR) and security information 
and event management (SIEM) tools.  
● Consider using an information technology  asset management (ITAM) solution to ensure 
EDR, SIEM, vulnerability scanners , and other simil ar tools  are reporting  the same number 
of assets  [CPG 2.T , 2.V]. 
○ Use web application firewalls to monitor and filter web traffic.  
● These tools are commercially avai lable via hardware, software, and cloud-based solutions, 
and may detect and mitigate exploitation attempts where a cyber actor sends a malicious 
web request to an unpatched device  [CPG 2.B, 2.F]. 
○ Implement an administrative policy and/or automated process configured to monitor unwanted 
hardware, software, or programs against an allowlist with specified, approved versions  [CPG 
2.Q]. 
Supply Chain Security  
 Reduce third -party applications and unique system/application builds —provide exceptions only if 
required to support business critical functions  [CPG 2.Q ]. 
 Ensure contracts r equire vendors and/or third -party service providers to: 
○ Provide  notification of security incidents and vulnerabilities within a risk informed time frame  
[CPG 1.G , 1.H , 1.I]. 
○ Supply a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) with all products to enhance vulnerability 
monitoring a nd to help reduce time to respond to identified vulnerabilities [CPG 4.B ]. 
 Ask your software providers to dis cuss their secure by design program , provide links to information 
about how they are working to remove classes of vulnerabilities, and to set secure default settings.
