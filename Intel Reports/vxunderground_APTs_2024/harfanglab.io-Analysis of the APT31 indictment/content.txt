Analysis of the APT31 indictment
Identifier: TRR240401 
On March 25, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) released an indictment of seven hackers associated
with APT31, a “hacking group in support of China’s Ministry of State Security” (MSS) which has been active for
14 years. On the same day, the Department of Treasury enacted sanctions on several entities listed in the
document.
While the U.S. government doesn’t usually disclose investigation methods or IOCs – limiting verifiability of their
claims – its attributions have so far never been proven wrong[1]. We gave the indictment a careful read, as such
documents always reveal valuable tradecraft information. Key takeaways are:
APT31 is attributed to the Hubei State Security Department, located in Wuhan;
Around 2010, APT31 created a front company named “Wuhan XRZ” and used it as a cover for its cyber
operations. Another local company, “Wuhan Liuhe” (not accused of being an MSS front), provided support;
APT31 created and used the RAWDOOR malware, handled a few other malware families used by other
Chinese-speaking threat actors, and more recently started using cracked versions of CobaltStrike;
The group favors a two-band approach to hacking, and goes after subsidiaries, MSPs or spouses of its
targets as a means of initial access.
Who is APT31?
APT31, also known as BRONZE VINEWOOD, Zirconium or Judgment Panda, is a long-standing Chinese-
speaking threat actor. In the recent years, it garnered attention for:
2/7
Breaking into the network of the Finnish parliament in 2021;
Repurposing the “EpMe” 0day (CVE-2017-0005) captured from EquationGroup;
In late 2021, ANSSI reported on a large APT31 campaign against French entities, and noted the
uncharacteristic use of compromised SOHO routers as anonymization infrastructure;
Finally, in 2022, APT31 launched a campaign against Russian media and energy companies, where it
leveraged Yandex Cloud as a command and control (C2) infrastructure (as opposed to Dropbox for other
campaigns in the West).
Overall, the group is a skilled threat actor, not known to handle cutting-edge 0-day exploits but still capable of
devising creative homemade tooling.
The private-public ecosystem
As evidenced in our in-depth review of the I-Soon leak, a significant part of the Chinese cyber-offense apparatus
is composed of many small to medium companies conducting hacking operations for the benefit of the state. The
APT31 indictment features two such companies:
Wuhan Liuhe Tiangong Science & Technology Co., Ltd (“Wuhan Liuhe”), founded by one of the
defendants;
Wuhan Xiaoruizhi Science & Technology Co., Ltd (“Wuhan XRZ”), a “front” for the Chinese MSS according
to the U.S. DoJ.
Among the seven defendants, four are listed as contractors for Wuhan XRZ, one is the founder of Wuhan Liuhe,
and the last two do not have an explicit affiliation. Wuhan XRZ is accused of being responsible of the hacking,
while Wuhan Liuhe provided support. Beyond them, the indictment mentions “dozens” of MSS intelligence
officers, hackers and support staff (identified by the DoJ but not named in the document) who contributed to the
malicious activities.
The document is unclear on why Wuhan Liuhe is only considered to have provided support (and thus wasn’t
sanctioned), since the one employee cited appears to have maintained victim lists, handled malware and
deployed webshells. In any case, the frontier between contractors and intelligence community members appears
extremely thin, as one Wuhan XRZ employee developed the RAWDOOR malware (as well as a keylogger and
managed the associated infrastructure) while “co-located with an identified MSS officer”.
APT31’s tactics, techniques and procedures
APT31 appears to have operated using a two-phase methodology, where victims would first receive an email
supposedly coming from prominent US journalists. The emails contained legitimate news article excerpts,
accompanied by tracking links – which we assume ultimately lead to the original article. Clicking them allowed
attackers to obtain preliminary targeting information, such as the type of device on which the email was opened,
as well as the public IP address of the recipient. Over 10,000 tracking emails were sent between June and
September 2018 only[2].
The threat actor would then use the collected information to engage in direct hacking attempts of the victim’s
devices based on this information (T1598.003). In particular, the indictment notes that APT31 would actively
target their victims’ family members, so they could go after home routers instead of better protected company
3/7
networks. The observation that APT31 focused on SOHO devices is consistent with ANSSI’s December 2021
report.
Tooling-wise, APT31 initially used a number of malware families (RAWDOOR, Trochilus, EvilOSX,
DropDoor/DropCat[3], etc.), all staged through DLL side-loading. Then the attackers switched to cracked
versions of CobaltStrike, an infamous commercial penetration-testing tool. In one case, the U.S. DoJ explains the
attackers compromised the subsidiary of a victim (a defense contractor manufacturing flight simulators for the
military) before pivoting into the core network from there. The hack involved a local privilege escalation 0-day
exploit (we assume CVE-2017-0005, mentioned previously) before exploiting an SQL injection.
While it seems APT31 prefers server-side exploitation (where interactions with the victim are kept to a minimum)
for these campaigns, other activities listed in the indictment (for instance, going after Hong Kong’s Umbrella
Movement activists throughout 2019) show that the actor also relied on spearphishing emails containing
malicious attachments or links. The defendants are also accused of creating fake Adobe Flash update pages to
deploy the EvilOSX malware (T1036).
A final, less obvious detail contained in the indictment is the fact that APT31 relied on double infections for at
least some of the victims, allowing them to regain access to the network if the first malware implant was
discovered.
About the RAWDOOR malware family
In the list of malware families contained in the indictment, we were not immediately able to associate RAWDOOR
with a publicly documented malware strain – save for one mention in an archived transcript of a 2016 iSight
report. We nonetheless identified a binary sample (SHA256
c3056e39f894ff73bba528faac04a1fc86deeec57641ad882000d7d40e5874be) which was first
submitted in September 2015 to an online multi-scanner service, identified as “Rawdoor” by some security
products, and “Warood” (a close anagram) by others.
A closer inspection of this malware sample turned out that it is a dropper, deploying either an x86 or x64 payload
contained in its resources. The second stage is installed as a service, with uncharacteristic stealth compared to
Chinese-speaking threat actor techniques documented for that era:
The installer inspects the contents of HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows
NT\CurrentVersion\SvcHost\netsvcs and looks for an entry which doesn’t have a corresponding
service in HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\.
When one is found, it drops its payload as %WinDir%\Installer\~DF313.msi. The file is timestomped
with the attributes of the system’s calc.exe file (T1070.006).
Then it creates the “missing” service with automatic startup, using the command line
%SystemRoot%\system32\svchost.exe -k netsvcs. The installer edits the corresponding registry
key manually to set the ServiceDll value to the dropped file.
Finally, the dropper starts the service, causing the second stage to load.
A summary analysis of the next stage by Microsoft can be found here. We would add to it that the sample we
studied uses GitHub as a Command & Control channel[4]
(hxxps://raw.githubusercontent[.]com/willbill4/workspaceer/master/9proxy5/ReadMe.txt).
The corresponding GitHub repository (still online at the time of this writing) received 39 commits between August
4/7
5, 2015 and June 6, 2017. The Release folder contains additional binaries, such as a copy of RAWDOOR, likely
for update purposes; a PlugX sample; penetration testing utilities such as “netcat”, and other unidentified
malware samples.
Considering that samples of the Warood malware family use “RawDoor” as an internal name and in some logging
messages, and that some of them contain traces of being compiled on machines in the Chinese language, we
assess with high confidence that this malware family is the one referred to in the indictment. Corresponding
indicators of compromise are listed in Appendix.
APT31’s flexibility
The indictment notes that the threat actor could change targets extremely quickly, based on political events
taking place in the world. It lists a few examples:
In the context of economic tensions between the U.S. and China, the United States implemented tariffs on
imported steel. A day later, as China’s Ministry of Commerce promised a “major response”, APT31 started
registering infrastructure impersonating the American Steel Company, then shortly thereafter the
International Steel Trade Forum. These domains were immediately used as C2 servers for malware
deployed in the network of the American Steel Company.
Following the nomination of Hong Kong activists for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2018, APT31 went after the
Norwegian government as well as a major Norwegian Managed Services Provider (MSP).
Mid-July 2020, shortly after negative comments from the U.S. administration about China’s territorial claims
in the South China Sea, APT31 initiated a spearphishing campaign targeting the U.S. Navy and
organizations or think tanks related to it.
Assessment
This indictment contains information consistent with pre-existing knowledge on both APT31 tradecraft, and the
nature of the cooperation between public and private Chinese entities on cyber-offense matters. While the U.S.
opted not to indict members of the MSS (or if it did, chose not to identify them as such), it is obvious from reading
the document that it considers private contractors as intelligence community members.
APT31 has targeted (and in many cases, successfully breached) many high-profile entities in the Western world.
The indictment provides a comprehensive view of the group’s interests, ranging from diplomatic intelligence to
the theft of trade secrets and even financial data (see full list in appendix). In addition, the U.S. DoJ indicates that
the call data records for “millions of Americans” have been acquired by the attackers, which hints at the
compromission of at least one telecommunications provider in the country.
It is certain that APT31 is responsible for many more campaigns outside of the United States, not covered by this
indictment – particularly in Europe.

[1] It is in fact quite surprising to see that the DoJ is able to attribute specific actions (i.e., writing a piece of
malware, managing a victim list or sending a malicious email) to individual defendants, as opposed to their front
company.
[2] Email tracking technology is not groundbreaking in itself and is used by advertisers all over the world in their
emailing campaigns. The indictment contains references to a commercial service enabling mass email and mail
merge, used to send those vast quantities of emails to the victims. Previous reporting by ANSSI indicates this is
likely GMass. It follows that the information tracking component was not developed by APT31, but is instead a
built-in feature of those services.
[3] Likely the malware strain known as DropboxAES.
[4] This behavior is consistent with APT31’s use of public or cloud services for similar purposes. The earliest
Rawdoor sample we studied (SHA256
