Star Blizzard increases sophistication and evasion in
ongoing attacks
⋮ 12/7/2023
Microsoft Threat Intelligence continues to track and disrupt malicious activity attributed to a Russian
state-sponsored actor we track as Star Blizzard (formerly SEABORGIUM, also known as COLDRIVER
and Callisto Group). Star Blizzard has improved their detection evasion capabilities since 2022 while
remaining focused on email credential theft against the same targets. Star Blizzard, whose activities we
assess to have historically supported both espionage and cyber influence objectives, continues to
prolifically target individuals and organizations involved in international affairs, defense, and logistics
support to Ukraine, as well as academia, information security companies, and other entities aligning with
Russian state interests. Microsoft continues to refine and deploy protections against Star Blizzard’s
evolving spear-phishing tactics.
Microsoft is grateful for the collaboration on investigating Star Blizzard compromises with the international
cybersecurity community, including our partners at the UK National Cyber Security Centre, the US
National Security Agency Cybersecurity Collaboration Center, and the US Federal Bureau of
Investigation.
This blog provides updated technical information about Star Blizzard tactics, techniques, and procedures
(TTPs), building on our 2022 blog as the actor continues to refine their tradecraft to evade detection. As
2/17
with any observed nation-state actor activity, Microsoft directly notifies customers that have been targeted
or compromised, providing them with the necessary information to secure their accounts.
Based on our analysis of the actor’s TTPs since our previous blog in 2022, Star Blizzard has evolved to
focus on improving its detection evasion capabilities. Microsoft has identified five new Star Blizzard
evasive techniques:
Use of server-side scripts to prevent automated scanning of actor-controlled infrastructure.
Use of email marketing platform services to hide true email sender addresses and obviate the need
for including actor-controlled domain infrastructure in email messages
Use of a DNS provider to obscure the IP addresses of actor-controlled virtual private server (VPS)
infrastructure. Once notified, the DNS provider took action to mitigate actor-controlled domains abusing
their service.
Password-protected PDF lures or links to cloud-based file-sharing platforms where PDF lures are
hosted
Shifting to a more randomized domain generation algorithm (DGA) for actor-registered domains
Beginning in April 2023, we observed Star Blizzard gradually move away from using hCaptcha servers as
the sole initial filter to prevent automatic scanning of their Evilginx server infrastructure. Redirection was
still performed by an actor-controlled server, now first executing JavaScript code (titled “Collect and Send
User Data”) before redirecting the browsing session to the Evilginx server.
Shortly after, in May 2023, the threat actor was observed refining the JavaScript code, resulting in an
updated version (titled “Docs”), which is still in use today.
This capability collects various information from the browser performing the browsing session to the
redirector server.
pluginsEmpty(): This function checks if the browser has any plugins installed.
isAutomationTool(): This function checks for various indicators that the page is being accessed by
an automation tool (such as Selenium, PhantomJS, or Nightmare) and returns an object with information
about the detected tools.
sendToBackend(data): This function sends the data collected by isAutomationTool() to the server
using a POST request. If the server returns a response, the message in the response is executed using
eval().
Following the POST request, the redirector server assesses the data collected from the browser and
decides whether to allow continued browser redirection.
When a good verdict is reached, the browser receives a response from the redirection server, redirecting
to the next stage of the chain, which is either an hCaptcha for the user to solve, or direct to the Evilginx
server.
A bad verdict results in the receipt of an HTTP error response and no further redirection.
We have observed Star Blizzard using two different services, HubSpot and MailerLite. The actor uses
these services to create an email campaign, which provides them with a dedicated subdomain on the
service that is then used to create URLs. These URLs act as the entry point to a redirection chain ending
3/17
at actor-controlled Evilginx server infrastructure. The services can also provide the user with a dedicated
email address per configured email campaign, which the threat actor has been seen to use as the “From”
address in their campaigns.
Most Star Blizzard HubSpot email campaigns have targeted multiple academic institutions, think tanks,
and other research organizations using a common theme, aimed at obtaining their credentials for a US
grants management portal. We assess that this use-case of the HubSpot mailing platform was to allow
the threat actor to track large numbers of identical messages sent to multiple recipients. Note should be
taken to the “Reply-to” address in these emails, which is required by the HubSpot platform to be an actual
in-use account. All the sender accounts in the following examples are dedicated threat actor-controlled
accounts.
Other HubSpot campaigns have been observed using the campaign URL embedded in an attached PDF
lure or directly in the email body to perform redirection to actor-controlled Evilginx server infrastructure
configured for email account credential theft. We assess that in these cases, the HubSpot platform was
used to remove the need for including actor-controlled domain infrastructure in the spear-phishing emails
and better evade detection based on indicators of compromise (IOC).
Star Blizzard’s use of the MailerLite platform is similar to the second HubSpot tactic described above,
with the observed campaign URL redirecting to actor-controlled infrastructure purposed for email
credential theft.
In December 2022, we began to observe Star Blizzard first using a domain name service (DNS) provider
that also acts as a reverse proxy server to resolve actor-registered domain infrastructure. As of May
2023, most Star Blizzard registered domains associated with their redirector servers use a DNS provider
to obscure the resolving IP addresses allocated to their dedicated VPS infrastructure.
We have yet to observe Star Blizzard utilizing a DNS provider to resolve domains used on Evilginx
servers.
Star Blizzard has been observed sending password-protected PDF lures in an attempt to evade email
security processes implemented by defenders. The threat actor usually sends the password to open the
file to the targeted user in the same or a subsequent email message.
In addition to password-protecting the PDF lures themselves, the actor has been observed hosting PDF
lures at a cloud storage service and sharing a password-protected link to the file in a message sent to the
intended victim. While Star Blizzard frequently uses cloud storage services from all major providers
(including Microsoft OneDrive), Proton Drive is predominantly chosen for this purpose.
Microsoft suspends Star Blizzard operational accounts discovered using our platform for their spear-
phishing activities.
Following the detailed public reporting by Recorded Future (August 2023) on detection opportunities for
Star Blizzard domain registrations, we have observed the threat actor making significant changes in their
chosen domain naming syntax.
Prior to the public reporting, Star Blizzard utilized a limited wordlist for their DGA. Subsequently, Microsoft
has observed that the threat actor has upgraded their domain-generating mechanism to include a more
4/17
randomized list of words.
Despite the increased randomization, Microsoft has identified detection opportunities based on the
following constant patterns in Star Blizzard domain registration behavior:
Namecheap remains the registrar of choice.
Domains are usually registered in groups, many times with similar naming conventions.
X.509 TLS certificates are provided by Let’s Encrypt, created in the same timeframe of domain
registration.
A list of recent domain names registered by Star Blizzard can be found at the end of this report.
Star Blizzard activities remain focused on email credential theft, predominantly targeting cloud-based
email providers that host organizational and/or personal email accounts.
Star Blizzard continues to utilize the publicly available Evilginx framework to achieve their objective, with
the initial access vector remaining to be spear-phishing via email. Target redirection to the threat actor’s
Evilginx server infrastructure is still usually achieved using custom-built PDF lures that open a browser
session. This session follows a redirection chain ending at actor-controlled Evilginx infrastructure that is
configured with a “phishlet” for the intended targets’ email provider.
Star Blizzard remains constant in their use of pairs of dedicated VPSs to host actor-controlled
infrastructure (redirector + Evilginx servers) used for spear-phishing activities, where each server usually
hosts a separate actor registered domain.
As with all threat actors that focus on phishing or spear-phishing to gain initial access to victim mailboxes,
individual email users should be aware of who these attacks target and what they look like to
improve their ability to identify and avoid further attacks.
The following are a list of answers to questions that enterprise and consumer email users should be
asking about the threat from Star Blizzard:
Users and organizations are more likely to be a potential Star Blizzard target if connected to the following
areas:
Government or diplomacy (both incumbent and former position holders).
Research into defense policy or international relations when related to Russia.
Assistance to Ukraine related to the ongoing conflict with Russia.
Remember that Star Blizzard targets both consumer and enterprise accounts, so there is an equal
threat to both organization and personal accounts.
The email will appear to be from a known contact that users or organizations expect to receive email
from. The sender address could be from any free email provider, but special attention should be paid to
emails received from Proton account senders (@proton.me, @protonmail.com) as they are frequently
used by Star Blizzard.
An initial email will usually be sent asking to review a document, but without any attachment or link to the
document.
5/17
The threat actor will wait for a response, and following that, will send an additional message with either
an attached PDF file or a link to a PDF file hosted on a cloud storage platform. The PDF file will be
unreadable, with a prominent button purporting to enable reading the content.
Pressing the button in a PDF lure causes the default browser to open a link embedded in the PDF file
code—this is the beginning of the redirection chain. Targets will likely see a web page titled “Docs” in the
initial page opened and may be presented with a CAPTCHA to solve before continuing the redirection.
The browsing session will end showing a sign-in screen to the account where the spear-phishing email
was received, with the targeted email already appearing in the username field.
The host domain in the web address is an actor-controlled domain (see appendix for full list), and
not the expected domain of the email server or cloud service.
If multifactor authentication is configured for a targeted email account, entering a password in the
displayed sign-in screen will trigger an authentication approval request. If passwordless access is
configured for the targeted account, an authentication approval request is immediately received on the
device chosen for receiving authentication approvals.
As long as the authentication process is not completed (a valid password is not entered and/or an
authentication request is not approved), the threat actor has not compromised the account.
If the authentication process is completed, the credentials have been successfully compromised by Star
Blizzard, and the threat actor has all the required details needed to immediately access the mailbox, even
if multifactor authentication is enabled.
As with any observed nation-state actor activity, Microsoft directly notifies customers that have been
targeted or compromised, providing them with the necessary information to secure their accounts.
Microsoft emphasizes that the following two mitigations will strengthen customers’ environments against
Star Blizzard attack activity:
Microsoft is sharing indicators of compromise related to this attack at the end of this report to encourage
the security community to further investigate for potential signs of Star Blizzard activity using their
security solution of choice. All these indicators have been incorporated into the threat intelligence feed
that powers Microsoft Defender products to aid in protecting customers and mitigating this threat. If your
organization is a Microsoft Defender for Office customer or a Microsoft Defender for Endpoint customer
with network protection turned on, no further action is required to mitigate this threat presently. A
thorough investigation should be performed to understand potential historical impact if Star Blizzard
activity has been previously alerted on in the environment.
Additionally, Microsoft recommends the following mitigations to reduce the impact of this threat:
Use advanced anti-phishing solutions that monitor and scan incoming emails and visited websites. For
example, organizations can leverage web browsers that automatically identify and block malicious
websites and provide solutions that detect and block malicious emails, links, and files.
Run endpoint detection and response (EDR) in block mode so that Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
can block malicious artifacts, even when your non-Microsoft antivirus does not detect the threat, or when
6/17
Microsoft Defender Antivirus is running in passive mode. EDR in block mode works behind the scenes to
remediate malicious artifacts that are detected post-compromise.
Configure investigation and remediation in full automated mode to allow Microsoft Defender for
Endpoint to take immediate action on alerts to resolve breaches, significantly reducing alert volume.
Turn on cloud-delivered protection and automatic sample submission on Microsoft Defender Antivirus
to cover rapidly evolving attacker tools, techniques, and behaviors. These capabilities use artificial
intelligence and machine learning to quickly identify and stop new and unknown threats.
Use security defaults as a baseline set of policies to improve identity security posture. For more
granular control, enable conditional access policies. Conditional access policies evaluate sign-in requests
using additional identity driven signals like user or group membership, IP location information, and device
status, among others, and are enforced for suspicious sign-ins. Organizations can protect themselves
from attacks that leverage stolen credentials by enabling policies such as compliant devices or trusted IP
address requirements.
Implement continuous access evaluation.
Continuously monitor suspicious or anomalous activities. Investigate sign-in attempts with suspicious
characteristics (for example, location, ISP, user agent, and use of anonymizer services).
Configure Microsoft Defender for Office 365 to recheck links on click. Safe Links provides URL
scanning and rewriting of inbound email messages in mail flow, and time-of-click verification of URLs and
links in email messages, other Office 365 applications such as Teams, and other locations such as
SharePoint Online. Safe Links scanning occurs in addition to the regular anti-spam and anti-malware
protection in inbound email messages in Exchange Online Protection (EOP). Safe Links scanning can
help protect your organization from malicious links that are used in phishing and other attacks.
Use the Attack Simulator in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 to organize realistic, yet safe, simulated
phishing and password attack campaigns in your organization by training end users against clicking
URLs in unsolicited messages and disclosing their credentials. Training should include checking for poor
spelling and grammar in phishing emails or the application’s consent screen as well as spoofed app
names, logos, and domain URLs appearing to originate from legitimate applications or companies. Note
that Attack Simulator testing only supports phishing emails containing links at this time.
Encourage users to use Microsoft Edge and other web browsers that support Microsoft Defender
SmartScreen, which identifies and blocks malicious websites, including phishing sites, scam sites, and
sites that contain exploits and host malware.
Microsoft Defender customers can turn on attack surface reduction rules to prevent common attack
techniques:
Block executable files from running unless they meet a prevalence, age, or trusted list criterion.
Block execution of potentially obfuscated scripts.
Microsoft Defender for Office offers enhanced solutions for blocking and identifying malicious emails.
Signals from Microsoft Defender for Office inform Microsoft 365 Defender, which correlate cross-domain
threat intelligence to deliver coordinated defense, when this threat has been detected. These alerts,
however, can be triggered by unrelated threat activity. Example alerts:
A potentially malicious URL click was detected
Email messages containing malicious URL removed after delivery
Email messages removed after delivery
7/17
Email reported by user as malware or phish
Microsoft Defender SmartScreen has implemented detections against the phishing domains represented
in the IOC section below. By enabling Network protection, organizations can block attempts to connect to
these malicious domains.
Aside from the Microsoft Defender for Office 365 alerts above, customers can also monitor for the
following Microsoft 365 Defender alerts for this attack. Note that these alerts can also be triggered by
unrelated threat activity. Example alerts:
Star Blizzard activity group
Suspicious URL clicked
Suspicious URL opened in web browser
User accessed link in ZAP-quarantined email
Microsoft customers can use the following reports in Microsoft products to get the most up-to-date
information about the threat actor, malicious activity, and techniques discussed in this blog. These reports
provide the intelligence, protection information, and recommended actions to prevent, mitigate, and
respond to associated threats found in customer environments.
Microsoft Sentinel customers can use the TI Mapping analytics (a series of analytics all prefixed with ‘TI
map’) to automatically match the malicious domain indicators mentioned in this blog post with data in
their workspace. If the TI Map analytics are not currently deployed, customers can install the Threat
Intelligence solution from the Microsoft Sentinel Content Hub to have the analytics rule deployed in their
Sentinel workspace.
