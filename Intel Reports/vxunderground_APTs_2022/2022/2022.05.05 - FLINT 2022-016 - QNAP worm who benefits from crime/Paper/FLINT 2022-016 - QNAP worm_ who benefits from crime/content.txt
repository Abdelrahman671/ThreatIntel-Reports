QNAP worm:
who benefits from crime?
OBJECTIVES:
UNKNOWN
INTRUSION SET:
UNKNOWN
Summary

In January 2022, SEKOIA obtained from a trusted source several IOCs related to a worm
which used compromised QNAP devices as command and control servers. This worm,
which seems to be present in many networks around the globe, has been seen active in
several french networks. 

Even if its spreading method doesn't use any vulnerabilities, its main code is quite
sophisticated and the infrastructure used is large. SEKOIA have been able to get one sample
of the code and the analysis is ongoing to understand its the aim: cybercriminals playing
around or more serious actors behind it?

Before having the full conclusions behind this threat, we wanted to share with our readers
some network IOCs and a few rules related to this threat in order to hunt it inside your
windows environments. We will be glad to have any feedback under TLP/NDA if you have
seen this threat inside your IT systems or have more intelligence related to it. 

Relaying on LNK files downloading an MSI
 
This worm is using LNK files taking the icons of removable devices to spread (eg. Network
shares, USB devices). These LNK files are using well-known techniques in order to download
 
 
 
 
and execute from a compromised device an MSI package containing a malicious library. 
 
Figure 1. Sample of LNKs used by the threat actor

At the time of writing, three execution chains using different obfuscation methods have
been seen used in the wild when a victim click on the shortcut file:
Use msiexec with the arguments -q (quiet) and -i (install) to download in HTTP and
install the remote MSI package.

Use wmic and the argument “product call install”  to download in HTTP and
install the remote MSI package.

Call cmd.exe to start a binary blob which contains the malicious msiexec execution
command, download and execute the malicious MSI and then execute explorer to
open the removable service.
The compromised device seems to act as a reverse proxy and verifies if the right URL is
provided by the client in order to send the malicious MSI package. If a wrong URL is
provided, the server will respond by the QNAP default 404 page (Server: http server 1.0),
otherwise it will respond with a “Server: nginx” header. Here is some URL patterns seen
being used in the wild:
http://[domain]:8080/[token]/[computername]=[username]
http://[domain]:8080/[token]/[computername]
http://[domain]:8080/[token]/[computername]?[username]
As the communication is in HTTP, it is quite easy to know which workstation and user have
been compromised inside your Windows environment by just looking at the network flows. 

SEKOIA.IO has been able to retrieve only one MSI package from the attacker infrastructure
and we still don’t know the logic behind the token generation and the other checks
performed by the server. 

The malicious downloaded MSI contains a heavily obfuscated DLL which is still under
analysis by SEKOIA.IO. However, according to our source and analysis, this DLL exfiltrates
environment execution data (Workstation name, Username, etc.) to a second infrastructure
composed of QNAP servers, also on the port 8080. We share at the end of the FLINT the
indicators related to this DLL.

QNAP infrastructure and beyond

At the beginning of the campaign, the MSI files were downloaded from compromised QNAP
devices but since the DeadBolt ransomware attack, the operators seem to have diversified
their infrastructure. New compromised devices have been seen, mostly Internet boxes in
Germany. In fact, few of their C2 were targeted by the DeadBolt ransomware because of
running vulnerable QNAP versions. 

These QNAP - and the rest of the compromised infrastructure - are resolved by small
domain names registered through few registrars such as Njalla (64), Registrar-servers (17),
Ndns (5) and Flokinet (2) since september 2021. As of today, 90 domain names have been
seen associated with this campaign, resolving 176 unique IP addresses.

In 
the 
chart 
above, 
a 
server 
named 
“mothership” 
is 
present. 
This 
server
(185.55.243[.]109) is the only-one C2 which is not a compromised device in this
infrastructure. We named it “mothership” because it is resolved by many domain names.
Moreover, we think with a medium confidence that the network redirections from the
compromised devices are made to it. 

One other questions remain unanswered today regarding the targeting: what vulnerabilities
do they use to compromise at least 13 different models of QNAP devices with firmware
versions varying from 4.2.6 to 5.0.0? Moreover, by plotting the whole C2 lists - including the
QNAP devices - on a map or via the autonomous systems we can clearly see a specific
targeting in Europe, especially German networks.

This campaign raises more questions than answers. We are constantly monitoring the
infrastructure to follow any changes from it and we hope to finish the analysis of the worm
in the next few weeks. In the meantime, please find attached to this FLINT the network IOCs
related to this campaign.

 
Filter Network Traffic - Use network appliances to filter
ingress or egress traffic and perform protocol-based
filtering. Configure software on endpoints to filter
network traffic.

Restrict File and Directory Permissions - Restrict access
by setting directory and file permissions that are not
specific to users or privileged accounts

Limit Hardware Installation - Limit the use of USB
devices and removable media within a network.
