JumpCloud Intrusion | Attacker Infrastructure Links Compromise to
North Korean APT Activity
Tom Hegel ⋮
In recent news, the cloud-based IT management service JumpCloud publicly shared details gathered from the
investigation into an intrusion on their network. Alongside the updated details, the organization shared a list of
associated indicators of compromise (IOCs), noting attribution to an unnamed “sophisticated nation-state sponsored
threat actor”.
Reviewing the newly released indicators of compromise, we associate the cluster of threat activity to a North Korean
state sponsored APT. The IOCs are linked to a wide variety of activity we attribute to DPRK, overall centric to the
supply chain targeting approach seen in previous campaigns.
Infrastructure Analysis
Based on the IOCs shared by JumpCloud, we were able to analyze the threat actor’s infrastructure. The following list
is our starting point:
Domains
alwaysckain.com
canolagroove.com centos-pkg.org
centos-repos.org
datadog-cloud.com datadog-graph.com
launchruse.com
nomadpkg.com
nomadpkgs.com
primerosauxiliosperu.com reggedrobin.com
toyourownbeat.com
zscaler-api.org
IP Addresses
51.254.24.19
185.152.67.39 70.39.103.3
66.187.75.186
104.223.86.8
100.21.104.112
23.95.182.5
78.141.223.50 116.202.251.38
89.44.9.202
192.185.5.189 162.241.248.14
179.43.151.196 45.82.250.186 162.19.3.23
144.217.92.197 23.29.115.171 167.114.188.40
91.234.199.179
By mapping out this infrastructure, it is possible to show the links between the diverse set of IP addresses and pick
up various patterns.
Triggering alerts on 192.185.5[.]189 alone is ill advised, as it’s a shared hosting server for many domains and not
an indicator of malicious activity by itself. However, toyourownbeat[.]com shares an SSL certificate with
skylerhaupt[.]com, indicating a potential relationship in owner.
The indicator 144.217.92[.]197 shared by JumpCloud does not host any domains listed, but we can see one
similar: npmaudit[.]com, which was just recently shared by GitHub associated with an alert of their own. Based on
2/2
public details available as of this writing, it’s unclear if the GitHub alert originated from the JumpCloud incident or if
they are separate efforts by the same attacker.
Infrastructure Map Noting JumpCloud links
Moving on to IP address 23.29.115[.]171, we can see through PDNS data that the domain npm-pool[.]org is
related. Notably, this domain is quite similar to the NPM theme of domains shared in the GitHub alert.
Infrastructure Map Noting JumpCloud and GitHub Overlap
While the following is not a strong indicator of attribution alone, it’s noteworthy that specific patterns in how the
domains are constructed and used follow a similar pattern to other DPRK linked campaigns we track. Indicators with
suspected actor association, but unverified as of this writing, include junknomad[.]com and insatageram[.]com
(registered with jeanettar671belden[@]protonmail[.]com).
Additional pivots of potential interest can be made through other IPs, including 167.114.188[.]40, and to a variety
of low confidence attacker-associated infrastructure.
Following the profile of the associated infrastructure from both the JumpCloud intrusion and the GitHub security alert,
we can expand to further associated threat activity. For example, we can see clear links to other NPM and “package”
themed infrastructure we associate with high to medium confidence, as noted in the list below. This list further
expands thanks to the findings and blog from Phylum in late June.
npmjscloud[.]com
npmcloudjs[.]com
nodepkg[.]com
dadiwarm[.]com
216.189.145[.]247
npmjsregister[.]com
142.44.178[.]222
tradingprice[.]net
bi2price[.]com
Trivial pivots from here can be made to similar behaving infrastructure linked to TraderTraitor, as noted by GitHub,
plus those of AppleJeus such as Celas Trade Pro via celasllc[.]com.
Conclusion
It is evident that North Korean threat actors are continuously adapting and exploring novel methods to infiltrate
targeted networks. The JumpCloud intrusion serves as a clear illustration of their inclination towards supply chain
targeting, which yields a multitude of potential subsequent intrusions. The DPRK demonstrates a profound
understanding of the benefits derived from meticulously selecting high-value targets as a pivot point to conduct
supply chain attacks into fruitful networks.
