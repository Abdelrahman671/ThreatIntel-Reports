In cybersecurity, the threats we don’t see—or don’t expect—often pose the greatest danger. Recently,
this became all too clear when three unmanaged AIX servers, sitting exposed on the internet, opened the
door for a China-Nexus Threat Actor to launch an attack. What may seem like obscure, legacy
technology became a launchpad for malicious activity, allowing the attacker to introduce a web shell and
pivot deeper into a Windows environment.
This incident highlights the growing risks posed by shadow IT and unmanaged systems, but more
importantly, it underscores the critical role that detection and response play in identifying and mitigating
threats. Even legacy technologies, like AIX servers, can become high-value targets for attackers. In this
blog, we’ll explore how the attackers quickly pounced an opportunity to take control of these unmanaged
systems and why comprehensive threat detection and response is essential for protecting every corner of
your network—no matter how small or seemingly insignificant.
Timeline of the Attacker’s Activity
2/4
Attacker access one of the AIX servers using the default credentials for the Apache AXIS Admin
portal
Attacker leverages the upload function of the AXIS admin portal to introduce the AxisInvoker web
shell
Attacker harvests Kerberos data from the AIX server
Attacker uploads requisite SSH keys and access the AIX server via SSH
Attacker performs reconnaissance gathering data through LDAP, SMB shares, network information,
and search local configuration files for more information about the systems and their configuration
Attacker attempts to introduce several post-exploitation tools such as Cobalt Strike beacons and
different JavaScript-based web shells
Attacker introduces the FRP reverse proxy tool to establish a direct connection from the attacker-
controlled infrastructure to the target network
Attacker executes various NTLM attacks to perform Active Directory reconnaissance and perform
account impersonation attacks for the local Administrator account
Attacker attempts to harvest credentials through dumping the LSASS process but is detected and
removed from the environment.
The Incident
In August 2024, malicious activity was detected on a Windows server. The alert was associated with an
attempt to dump the memory of the LSASS process—an indicator of a potential privilege escalation
attempt.

Through an investigation by Binary Defense and in conjunction with analysis from TrustedSec traced the
original alert back to a credential dumping attempt originated from an AIX server which was part of a
three AIX server development environment, left publicly accessible with default administrator credentials
for the Apache Axis admin portal. The evidence gathered by Binary Defense indicates the attacker had
initially compromised the servers in March of 2024 and was able to maintain persistent access to the
systems until August when they attempted to move laterally to a portion of the network which was in-
scope of the security tools. These types of oversights are often the result of shadow IT practices where
systems are deployed without the knowledge or control of the security team and regularly serve as
enticing entry points for attackers. The threat actor exploited the default Apache credentials to gain
administrative access, upload a web shell, and establish persistent access through SSH keys and a
reverse proxy.
A web shell is a malicious script that attackers upload to a web server, allowing them to remotely execute
commands, browse files, and control the server as if they were physically present. This tool gave the
attacker interactive access to the AIX server, effectively turning it into a launchpad for further attacks. To
maintain stealthy communication with the compromised server, the attacker used Fast Reverse Proxy
3/4
(FRP), a tool that creates a reverse tunnel back to the attacker’s infrastructure, bypassing network
defenses and firewalls.

Starting reverse proxy process
With this C2 (command-and-control) channel established, the attacker executed NTLM relay attacks, a
method where they capture and relay authentication credentials to impersonate a privileged user. This
technique allowed the attacker to enumerate Windows users and impersonate a valid Administrator
account within the Windows environment, ultimately attempting to dump the LSASS process to harvest
credential data.
This incident is a stark reminder that every device on a network, regardless of its purpose or visibility, can
be a potential target for attackers.
Unmanaged AIX Servers: Obscurity Does Not Guarantee Security
AIX systems, while not commonly targeted in the same way as Windows or Linux, are by no means
immune to attacks. The attackers in this case demonstrated their capability to identify and exploit the
vulnerabilities in these systems. By utilizing tools like AXISInvoker webshell and Fast Reverse Proxy
(FRP), they effectively turned a relatively obscure system into a beachhead for lateral movement into
other systems. This serves as a crucial reminder that security teams must be vigilant about all systems in
their network, not just the most obvious targets. It is worth noting that while the attacker was able to
navigate the AIX servers and utilize them to maintain access to the environment, they were unable to
establish a C2 channel over Cobalt Strike because they repeatedly attempted to use Linux commands
such as wget and curl which are not native to AIX.
The Importance of Comprehensive Security Monitoring
The attack was first detected when the China-Nexus threat actor attempted to pivot from the unmanaged
AIX servers into the more secure, managed Windows environment, where active security controls were
monitoring for suspicious activity. However, the story didn’t end there. Even after being thwarted from
their initial vector, the attacker made multiple failed attempts to regain access, demonstrating their
persistence.
4/4
Had the threat actor been able to maintain their foothold within the unmanaged AIX servers, they could
have operated undetected for an extended period, potentially causing far more significant damage. Their
repeated efforts to infiltrate the system emphasize just how relentless adversaries can be, especially
when targeting unmonitored or obscure systems. This incident highlights the critical importance of
comprehensive security monitoring across all systems, not just those that are actively managed or
considered high-priority. Without visibility into every corner of the network, even seemingly minor,
unmanaged systems can become a persistent source of risk.
Final Thoughts
This incident highlights the dangers of unmanaged and shadow IT systems, which can easily become the
weak link in an otherwise secure network. It also serves as a reminder that less commonly targeted
systems, like AIX, are not immune to attacks. Security teams must maintain visibility and control over all
networked devices to prevent similar breaches in the future. The incident also reinforces the importance
of regular audits, strong credential management, and the integration of security measures across all
environments.
Call to Action
Organizations must take a hard look at their current IT assets and ensure that every system—whether it’s
perceived as critical or obscure —are included in their security strategy. Every part of your network plays
a role in its overall strength, and by giving attention to each system, you’re building a more resilient
foundation.
