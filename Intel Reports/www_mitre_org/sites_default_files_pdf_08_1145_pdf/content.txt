Abstract 
The 2000 Maroochy Shire cyber event is the sec ond in a series of control system cyber 
events analyzed to determine the effectiveness of NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53 
controls on industrial control systems.  The event has been documented in Court proceedings, a Maroochy Water Services pr esentation, and other documentation available 
in the public domain.  The event was an inte ntional, targeted attack by a knowledgeable 
person on an industrial control system.  The case study examin es the event from a cyber 
security perspective.  It provides the timelines and cyber issues, examines the NIST 
SP800-53 controls that were viol ated or not met, and posits the potential mitigation that 
would have occurred if the NIST SP800-53 c ontrols had been followed.  The intent of 
this analysis is not to criticize any actions taken, but to look forward as to how lessons 
learned from this case can be of he lp to prevent future incidents. 
Attack Overview 
Vitek Boden, a man in his late 40s, worked for Hunter Watertech, an Australian firm that installed SCADA (Supervisory Control And Da ta Acquisition) radio-controlled sewage 
equipment for the Maroochy Shir e Council in Queensland, Aust ralia.  Boden applied for 
a job with the Maroochy Shire C ouncil, apparently after he walked away from a “strained 
relationship” with Hunter Watertech.  The Council decided not to hire him.  
Consequently, Boden decided to get even with both the Council and his former employer.  
He packed his car with stolen radio equipmen t attached to a (possibly stolen) computer.  
He drove around the area on at least 46 occasions from February 28 to April 23, 2000, issuing radio commands to the sewage equipmen t he (probably) helped install.  Boden 
caused 800,000 liters of raw sewage  to spill out into local pa rks, rivers and even the 
grounds of a Hyatt Regency hotel.  "Marine lif e died, the creek water turned black and 
the stench was unbearable for residents," said a representative of the Australian 
Environmental Protection Agency.
2  Boden coincidentally got caught when a policeman 
pulled him over for a traffic violation after one  of his attacks.  A judge sentenced him to 
two years in jail and ordered him to reimburse the Council  for cleanup.  Boden's attack 
became the first widely known example of someone maliciously breaking into a control system.  There are a few other reports of this  attack.  Slay and M iller, “Lessons Learned

Introduction  
This case study analyzes the event to determ ine how the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology (NIST) Special Publication ( SP) 800-53 controls might have prevented 
or mitigated the event.  The intent of this an alysis is not to criticize any actions taken, but 
to look forward as to how lessons learned from this case can be of he lp to prevent future 
incidents.  
The Maroochy Shire attack  has been documented in the Crown criminal case
5.  The 
offences occurred between 9 February 2000 and 23 April 2000 when Vitek Boden 
accessed computers controlling the Marooc hy Shire Council’s sewerage system and 
altered electronic data in the sewerage pum ping stations causing malfunctions in their 
operations.   
NIST Special Publication 800-5 3 and Related Documents 
NIST has established an Industrial C ontrol System (ICS) Security Project6 to improve the 
security of public and private sector IC S.  NIST SP 800-53 revision 2, December 2007, 
Recommended Security Controls fo r Federal Information Systems , provides 
implementing guidance and detail in the cont ext of two mandatory Federal Information 
Processing Standards (FIPS) that apply to  all federal information and information 
systems, including ICSs.  FIPS 200 requires th at federal agencies implement minimum 
security controls for thei r organizational information systems based on the FIPS 199 
security categorization of those systems.  Private sector and ot her organizations may 
consider the use of these sta ndards and guidelines as appropria te.  NIST is working with 
all stakeholders and other interested parties to develop conve rgent guidance on the 
application of these secu rity requirements to ICS.  
 Revision 2 of SP 800-53 incorporates gui dance on appropriate safeguards and 
countermeasures for federal ICS, that is also  potentially ap plicable and useful for the 
private sector.  NIST’s Computer Security Divisi on (Information Technology 
Laboratory) and Intelligent Systems Divisi on (Manufacturing Engineering Laboratory), 
in collaboration with the Depa rtment of Homeland Security and organizations within the 
federal government that own, operate, and maintain industrial control systems, developed the necessary ICS augmentations and interpre tations for the security controls, control 
enhancements, and supplemental guidance in SP 800-53.  The ICS augmentations and 
interpretations will facilitate the em ployment of appropriate safeguards and

countermeasures for these specialized informa tion systems that are part of the critical 
infrastructure of the United States.  
 In developing the ICS augmentations and inte rpretations, the origin al set of controls, 
enhancements, and supplemental guidance contained in Appendix F in SP 800-53 were not changed.  ICS Supplemental Guidance prov ides additional guidance on how to apply 
a control in ICS environments.  ICS Enhan cements are enhancement augmentations to 
the controls that are required for some IC S.  ICS Enhancement Supplemental Guidance 
provides guidance on how to apply an enhancement in ICS environments.  
 FIPS Publication 199 provides standards for categorizing information and information 
systems based on the potential impact on an  organization should certain events occur 
which jeopardize the information and informa tion systems needed by the organization to 
accomplish its assigned mission, protect its a ssets, fulfill its legal responsibilities, 
maintain its day-to-day functions, an d protect individuals.  Categorization of an 
information system must take into consideration  potential impacts to  other organizations 
and, in accordance with the USA PATRIO T Act of 2001 and Homeland Security 
Presidential Directives, potent ial national-level impacts.   
 
The security controls specifie d in SP 800-53 are organized into classes and families  for 
ease of use in the control selection and specification process.  Th ere are three general 
classes of security controls  (i.e., management, operational, and technical) and seventeen 
security control families.7  Each family contains security controls related to the security 
functionality of the family.  A two-character identifier is assigned to uniquely identify each control family.  Table 1 summarizes the cl asses and families in the security control 
catalog and the associated family identifiers.  A list of the minimum security controls, or 
security control baselines, for low-impact, moderate-impact, and high-impact information systems, as determined by applying the criteria in FIPS 199 have been published 
separately:  LOW-impact baseline at sp800-53-rev2-annex1.pdf; MODERATE-impact 
baseline at sp800-53-rev2-a nnex2.pdf; and HIGH-impact baseline at sp800-53-rev2-
annex3.pdf.  These are available at http ://csrc.nist.gov/publica tions/nistpubs/800-53-
Rev2/sp800-53-rev2-annex1.pdf, http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-53-Rev2/sp800-53-rev2-annex2.pdf, and http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-53-Rev2/sp800-53-rev2-annex3.pdf, respectively.  
                                                
 
7 The seventeen security control families in NIST Special  Publication 800-53 are closely aligned with the seventeen 
security-related areas in FIPS 200 specifying the minimum s ecurity requirements for protec ting federal information and 
information systems.  Families are assigned to their respective classes based on the dominant characteristics of the 
controls in that family.  Many security controls, however, can be logically associated with more than one class.  For 
example, CP-1, the policy and procedures control from the C ontingency Planning family, is  listed as an operational 
control but also has characteristics that are c onsistent with security management as well.

Maroochy Shire Site Description 
Maroochy Shire, a rural area of great natural beauty and a to urist destination, is located 
about 100 kilometers north of the Queensland State Capital of Brisbane.  It has an area of 
approximately 1,157 square kilometers with a population of approximately 120,000.  Maroochy Shire has 880 kilometers of gravity sewers treating an average of 35 million liters/day.  Maroochy Water Services Sewera ge SCADA System consists of 142 Sewage 
Pumping Stations with two Monitoring Computers utilizing three Ra dio Frequencies.  
Hunter Watertech Pty Ltd installed the “P DS Compact 500” computer device at each 
pumping station capable of receiving instru ctions from a central control center, 
transmitting alarm signals and other data to the central computer and providing messages 
to stop and start the pumps at the pumping station.  Communicati ons between pumping 
stations and between a pumpi ng station and the central comp uter were by means of a 
dedicated analog two-way radio system operating through repeater stations.  Each repeater station transmitted on a different frequency. 
The Attack  
The offences occurred between February  9, 2000 and April 23, 2000.  Vitek Boden 
accessed computers controlling the Maroochy Shire Council’s sewerage system, altering 
electronic data in particular sewerage pum ping stations causing malfunctions in their 
operations.  Vitek Boden had been employed by Hunter  Watertech as its site supervisor 
on the Maroochy SCADA project for about tw o years until resigning in December 1999.  
At about the time of his resignation he approached the Council seeking employment.  He was told to enquire again at a later date.  He made anothe r approach to the Council for 
employment in January 2000 and was told that  he would not be employed.  The sewerage 
system then experienced a series of faults: 
7/23/2008 4:15 PM 4 
 Pumps were not running when  they should have been  
 Alarms were not reporting to the central computer  
 A loss of communication between the cen tral computer and various pumping 
stations.  
 
An employee of Hunter Watertech, Mr. Yager,  was appointed to look into the problem.  
He began monitoring and recording all si gnals, messages and traffic on the radio 
network.  As a result of his i nvestigations he concluded th at many of the problems being 
experienced with the system resulted from human intervention rather than equipment 
failure.  Other technical expert s shared his opinion.  Further, the evidence revealed that 
the problems associated with the attack ceased when Vitek Boden was arrested.  On an occasion during Mr. Yager’s investigations, he ascertained that pumping station 14 seemed to be the source of the messages co rrupting the system.  He physically checked 
the pumping station and ascertained that it was working properly and bore no signs of 
having been physically tampered with.  He  concluded that the source of the false 
messages was a PDS Compact 500 computer with  an address of 14 and he changed the 
identification number of pump ing station 14 to 3 so that any legitimate messages from 
that station could be identified as coming from station 3.  Conversely, any messages coming from a station identifying itself as 14 would be known to be bogus.  
 On March 16, 2000, when malfunctions occurred in the system, Mr. Yager communicated over the network with a bogus pump station 14 that was sending messages 
to corrupt the system.  He was temporarily successful in altering hi s program to exclude 
the bogus messages but then had his computer s hut out of the network for a short period.  
The intruder was now using PDS identifica tion number 1 to send messages.  Further 
problems then occurred as a result of a pe rson gaining remote computer access to the 
system and altering data so that whatever function should have occurred at affected 
pumping stations did not occur or occurred in a different way.    The central computer was unable to exercise proper control and, at great inconvenience 
and expense, technicians had to be mobilized throughout the system to correct faults at affected pumping stations.  On one occasi on, a pumping station ove rflowed causing raw 
sewerage to escape.
  
 
On April 23, 2000, an intruder, by means of elect ronic messages, disabled alarms at four 
pumping stations using the identification of pumping station 4.  The intrusions began just 
after 7:30 pm and concluded just after 9:00 pm.  By this time Vitek Boden had fallen 
under suspicion and was under surveillance.  Po lice officers located a vehicle driven by 
him.  When Boden’s vehicle was pulled over and searched at around 10:00 pm, a PDS 
Compact 500 computer, later identified in evid ence as the property of Hunter Watertech, 
was found, as was a laptop computer.    On examination it was found that the software  to enable the lapt op to communicate with 
the PDS system through the PDS computer had been re-installed in the laptop on February 29, 2000. The PDS Compact computer had been programmed to identify itself 
as pump station 4 – the identification used  by the intruder in  accessing the Council 
sewerage system earlier that night.  The software program installed in the laptop was one 
7/23/2008 4:15 PM 5 
developed by Hunter Watertech for its us e in changing configur ations in the PDS 
computers.  There was evidence that this pr ogram was required to enable a computer to 
access the Council’s sewerage system  and had no other practical use.  The unchallenged 
evidence of Sergeant. Kingsley, a police comput er expert, was that the program had been 
used at least 31 times between April 7 and April 19 and that it was la st used at 9:31 pm 
on April 23, 2000.  Also found in the car was a two-way radio set to the frequencies of 
the repeater stations and the leads necessary to connect th e PDS computer, the laptop and 
the radio.  
 Mr. Yager and others gave evidence that  the conduct of the pers on responsible for the 
unauthorized interventions in the computer sy stem displayed a detailed familiarity with 
the system, beyond that which was likely to be held even by Council technical staff.  
Technical experts other than Mr. Yager al so gave evidence that the computer 
malfunctions, the subject of the charges, were the result of human intervention.  When apprehended by police Boden asserted in a ta ped conversation that all the items in the 
vehicle were his own.  He said he had been  up to Rainbow Beach and that he used the 
computer for study, personal correspondence and work in his family business.  He later 
sent a letter to the police requesting the imme diate return of his pr operty.  Examination of 
the laptop found in the car revealed start up and shut down times (on and after February 
28, 2000) consistent with the time of the attacks which Mr. Yager had uncovered and 
which he had logged.  The existence of other problems in the syst em showed that the malfunctions were the 
result of human intervention.  Once it was de monstrated that the malfunctions resulted 
from human intervention, the existence of other problems became of limited significance.  Mr. Yager was adamant that the malfunctions in  the system could only have been caused 
by unauthorized human intervention.  Boden sought to establish that some of the electronic messages that gave rise to the 
charges could have been caused by system malfunction or by error on the part of Council employees.  One of his arguments in this regard showed three sets of identical messages on the same day from addresses 000, 099 and 004.  The Crown contended that only the message emanating from address 004 was init iated by Boden.  Boden pointed to the other 
messages as evidence that defective messages of the nature of t hose relied on by the 
Crown may have been caused other than by human intervention.   Another witness, Mr. Lewer–an engineer spec ializing in computer engineering who, for a 
time, was Hunter Watertech’s project engineer  on the installation of the computerized 
sewerage system– said that all three messa ges were generated by the PDS configuration 
program used on the PDS Compact computer s.  Mr. Lewer’s opi nion was that the 
messages, other than the ones from address 004, were generated by persons attempting to 
rectify the result of the alleged unauthorized intervention.  He also gave evidence that 
that 000 and 099 messages were not causing dama ge to the computer system.  Mr. Yager 
gave evidence some days later than Mr. Lewe r and thus had more opportunity to consider 
the possible explanations for the 000 and 099 messages.  His evidence was that these 
messages occurred over several days and result ed from the actions of maintenance staff 
7/23/2008 4:15 PM 6 
who were either employees of Hunter Watert ech or Council employees  under direction of 
the former.  He ruled out the possibility of mechanical error.  He said that the 004 
messages were definitely generated by a pers on different from the one who generated the 
other messages.

Evidence  
The counts on which Boden was found guilty related to acts of cyber penetration which commenced on or about February 28, 2000.  
• The laptop taken by the police from Boden’s vehicle had been reloaded with most 
of its software operating programs on February 28, 2000 
• PDS software file had been installed or  re-installed on the laptop on February 29 
at 3:46 pm.  This is the software used  to run or access th e computers in the 
sewerage system. 
o Run at least 31 times prior to April 19 
o Last run on April 23 
• Two-way radio was of the type used in  the Council’s communication system.  
o Tuned into the frequencies of the repeater stations 
o Serial numbers on the radio matche d delivery docket provided by the 
supplier of the radios to Hunter Watertech. 
• PDS Compact 500 
o Address set to 004 
o Serial number identified it as a device  which should have been in the 
possession of Hunter Watertech.  
Attack Summary 
• Vitek Boden was an insider who was neve r an employee of the organization he 
attacked.  
o He was an employee of a contractor  that supplied IT/control system 
technology to the Maroochy Shire Council.  
7/23/2008 4:15 PM 7 
o With his knowledge he was the “ultimate insider”.  
• The service contract was deficient or  inadequate concerning Watertech’s 
responsibilities 
o Management, technical and operational  cyber security controls required 
o Personnel security controls that applied to its employees such as 
background investigations and protec tion from disgruntled employees 
• A number of anomalous events occurred  before recognition that the incidents 
were intentional.  
o As a skillful adversary, Boden was able to disguise his actions. 
o Extensive digital forensics were required to determine that a deliberate attack was underway  
• There were no existing cyber secu rity policies or procedures. 
• There were no cyber security defenses . 
Observations 
As reported by Slay & Miller, R obert Stringfellow was the civil engineer in charge of the 
water supply and sewage systems at Marooc hy Water Services during the time of the 
breach and has presented his analysis in closed forums.  Stringfellow observed: 
• At first it was easier to blame installation errors for the problems.  
• Upon reinstalling all the software an d checking the system, pump station 
settings kept changing beyond the ability of  the system to do this automatically 
• Conclusion: an external malicious entity was using wireless equipment to access the SCADA system. 
Stringfellow's analysis of the incide nt made several important points: 
• It is very difficult to prot ect against insider attacks. 
• Radio communications commonly used in SCADA systems are generally insecure 
or are improperly configured. 
• SCADA devices and software should be secured to the extent possible using 
physical and logical controls 
• It is often that case that security cont rols are not implemented or are not used 
properly 
• SCADA systems must record all device accesses and commands, especially those 
involving connections to or from remote si tes; this requires fairly sophisticated 
logging mechanisms. 
Stringfellow also recommended the use of anti-virus and firewall protection along with appropriate use of encrypti on. He emphasized a need for upgrade-able SCADA systems 
(from a security perspective), proper staff training, and security auditing and control. 
Applying SP 800-53 Controls 
This case revolves around a di sgruntled insider who was never an employee of the 
organization he attacked.  Some of the issues raised by analysis  of this case are just being 
addressed by cyber security practitioners 8 years later.  Some are unresolved with no 
solution in sight.  .  
7/23/2008 4:15 PM 8 
All of Boden’s malicious activities are addressed by SP 800-53 controls, as detailed 
below.  Several pervasive prophylactic m easures covered by SP 800-53 controls 
immediately come to mind.  These measures, not  related to an specific malicious activity 
are discussed first.  Table 2 lists problems uncovered by the investigation into the attack 
and the corresponding SP 800-53 control that could have prevented or mitigated it.

Policy and Procedures 
Every organization should have cyber secur ity policy and procedures.  There are many 
discretionary and judgmental activates that  require guidance.  Common sense isn’t 
sufficient; dos and don’ts need to be written down.   
 Neither organization had cyber security policie s or procedures in place.  For example: 
AC-18 Wireless Access Restrictions (i) estab lishes usage restrictions and implementation 
guidance for wireless technologies; and (ii) au thorizes, monitors, controls wireless access 
to the information system..  Such policy w ould have addressed the two-way radio that 
was used by Boden.  
 
The first control in every control family ad dresses policy and procedure.  With minor 
variations, the control begi ns:  “The organization de velops, disseminates, and 
periodically reviews/updates : (i) a formal, documented, in cident response policy that 
addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibi lities, management commitment, coordination 
among organizational entities, and compliance;  and (ii) formal, documented procedures 
to facilitate ….”  Although enumerated for each control family, the family policy can be included as part of the general information security policy for the organization.  Family 
control procedures can be developed for th e security program in  general, and for a 
particular information system, when required. 
Personnel Security 
Since Boden was never a Maroochy Council em ployee, direct hiring controls by the 
Maroochy Council were technically not applicable.  However, is it prudent for to have a 
key personnel clause to protec t the client from unilateral ch anges in key personnel by the 
contractor.  In general, the contract should extend applicab le Personnel Security controls 
to contractor employees.  Determining which controls to apply to on-site contractor 
7/23/2008 4:15 PM 9 
personnel may not be easy since it depends on the role played by the individual.  The 
Personnel Security family (PS) contains the following controls:  
PS-1 Personnel Security Policy and 
Procedures PS-5 Personnel Transfer 
PS-2 Position Categorization PS-6 Access Agreements 
PS-3 Personnel Screening PS-7 Third-Party Personnel Security 
PS-4 Personnel Termination PS-8 Personnel Sanctions 
 PS-7 identifies the need for contractual obligations on the subcontractor concerning 
personnel security.  Controls PS-3 and 4 should certainly be  considered.  In practice 
many positions may be occupied by employees  or contractors.  The contractual 
obligations should support e qual treatment for direct employees and contractor 
employees.   
System and Services Acquisition 
Hunter Watertech supplied hardware, softwa re, and services to the Maroochy Shire 
Council.  The cyber security responsibilities of the contract or organization (e.g., Hunter 
Watertech) and the contracto r’s employees (e.g., Boden) should be included in the 
contract between the organiza tions. Almost all of the cont rols applicable to direct 
employees are also applicable to contractor  employees, but the exact details may vary.  
Many of these controls also obligate the contractor organization concerning record 
keeping and other support servi ces.  Applicable security cont rols are in the System and 
Services Acquisition family (SA) are listed be low.  There is no indication that any of 
these controls were included in the contra ct between Hunter Wa tertech and Maroochy 
Shire Council.  All the contro ls are important; we believe that SA-4 and 11 might have 
helped directly in in this case.

Awareness and Training 
Personnel were not trained in preventing, recognizing, or responding to cyber-related 
incidents.  Security awareness and training inform personnel of the information security 
risks associated with their activities and their responsib ilities in complying with 
organizational policies and procedures desi gned to reduce these risks.  The Awareness 
and Training family (AT) cont ains the following controls:  
AT-1 Security Awareness and 
Training Policy and Procedures AT-4 Security Training Records 
AT-2 Security Awareness AT-5 Contacts with Security Groups 
and Associations 
AT-3 Security Training   
 
Every control except AT-5 could have he lped in this case .  NIST SP 800-50, Building an 
Information Technology Security  Awareness and Training Program, provides additional 
information. 
Audit 
The Maroochy communications and control com ponents lacked sufficient audit capability 
to support fault determination or forensic anal ysis.  Audit is concerned with collecting 
information that is significan t and relevant to the security  of the information system.  
Audit supports other control families such as incident response, access control, and flaw 
remediation.  The Audit and A ccountability family (AU) contains the following controls:  
 
AU-1 Audit and Accountability Policy 
and Procedures AU-7 Audit Reduction and Report 
Generation 
AU-2 Auditable Events AU-8 Time Stamps 
AU-3 Content of Audit Records AU-9 Protection of Audit 
Information 
AU-4 Audit Storage Capacity AU-10 Non-repudiation 
AU-5 Response to Audit Processing 
Failures AU-11 Audit Record Retention 
AU-6 Audit Monitoring, Analysis, and 
Reporting   
 
AU-2, 3, 4, 6, 7,9, and 11 apply to this case. 
Contingency Planning 
The analysis indicates that th ere were no plans to deal w ith an emergency or system 
disruption.  Effective contingency planning, execution, and testing are essential to 
mitigate the risk of system and service unavailability.  The Contingency Planning family 
(CP) contains the following controls:   
7/23/2008 4:15 PM 11 
CP-1 Contingency Planning Policy 
and Procedures CP-6 Alternate Storage Site 
CP-2 Contingency Plan CP-7 Alternate Processing Site 
CP-3 Contingency Training CP-8  Telecommunications Services 
CP-4 Contingency Plan Testing and 
Exercises CP-9 Information System Backup 
CP-5 Contingency Plan Update CP-10 Information System Recovery 
and Reconstitution 
 
CP-2, 3, 4, 5, and 8 apply to this case.   NIST SP 800-34 provides guidance on 
contingency planning. 
Incident Response 
Response to the sewerage discharge was ad  hoc.  Considerable time elapsed during 
troubleshooting before malicious intent was c onsidered.  An incident response capability 
is necessary for rapidly detecting incident s, minimizing loss and destruction, mitigating 
the weaknesses that were exploited, restor ing computing services , and apprehending 
malefactors.  Because performing incident re sponse effectively is a complex undertaking, 
establishing a successful incide nt response capability requires substa ntial planning and 
resources.  Establishing clea r procedures for assessing the current and potential business 
impact of incidents is critical, as is implementing effective methods of collecting, 
analyzing, and reporting data.  Building relationships and es tablishing suitable means of 
communication with other internal groups (e.g., human resources, legal) and with 
external groups (e.g., other inci dent response teams, law enforc ement) are also vital.  The 
Incident Response family (IR) c ontains the following controls:  
 
IR-1 Incident Response Policy and 
Procedures IR-5 Incident Monitoring 
IR-2 Incident Response Trai ning IR-6 Incident Reporting 
IR-3 Incident Response Testing and 
Exercises IR-7 Incident Response Assistance 
IR-4 Incident Handling   
 All of these controls are a pplicable to the Maroochy syst em.  NIST SP 800-61 provides 
guidance on incident handling and repor ting.  NIST SP 800-83 provides guidance on 
malware incident hand ling and prevention.   
Information Protection 
Cryptography is employed as a protective m echanism for many objectives.  A second line 
of defense that was widely deployed only in 2006 was encryption protection of 
information in stolen and lost devices.    
7/23/2008 4:15 PM 12 
The US Office of Management and Budget (O MB) issued a policy memorandum in June 
20068, recommending safeguards for all federal government agencies. Safeguards 
relevant to this case are:  
 Encrypt all data on mobile computers/devi ces which carry agency data unless the 
data is determined to be non-sensitive, in writing, by the Deputy Secretary or an 
individual he/she may designate in writing. 
 Allow remote access only with two-factor authentication where one of the factors 
is provided by a device separate fr om the computer gaining access. 
 
While this OMB policy was issued in respons e to loss or theft of devices containing 
Personal Identification Information (PII), it s phrasing encompasses protection of all 
sensitive data and information.  The specific inte nt of this policy is to compensate for the 
protections offered by the physical security co ntrols when information is removed from, 
or accessed from outside of the agency lo cation and when information is physically 
transported outside of the agency’s secured, physical perimeter (this includes information 
transported on removable media on portable/m obile devices such as laptop computers 
and/or personal dig ital assistants).   
 The System and Communications Protection family (SC) contains 23 controls.  The 
controls addressing cryptography are: 
 
SC-1   System and Communications 
Protection Policy   and 
Procedures   SC-13  Use of Cryptography  
SC-9  Transmission Confidentiality  SC-17  Public Key Infrastructure 
Certificates  
 The OMB policy is more explicit.  This pol icy would have addressed the laptop and two-
way radio that were in Boden's possession when  he was arrested.  However, since Boden 
had reloaded the software and no data disclo sure was involved, the practical impact is 
little to none. 
Malicious Activities 
Table 3 lists Boden’s malicious activities and the corresponding SP 800-53 control that 
could have prevented or mitigated it.

Access Control  
Access Control is the process of granting or denying specifi c requests for obtaining and 
using information and related information pr ocessing services.  This is one of the 
fundamental controls on any IT system.  Most access controls are base d on the identity of 
the person, process, or device involved.  Therefore, Identific ation and Authentication are 
intimately tied with access contro l.  Access controls need to be applied appropriate to the 
communications environment.   
 
Access controls are the first line of defense against error and omissions and malicious 
attacks from insiders and outsiders.  The Access Control family (AC) contains the 
following controls:   
AC-1 Access Control Policy and 
Procedures AC-11 Session Lock 
AC-2 Account Management AC-12 Session Termination 
AC-3 Access Enforcement AC-13 Supervision and Review—
Access Control 
AC-4 Information Flow Enforcement AC-14 Permitted Actions without 
Identification or 
Authentication 
AC-5 Separation of Duties AC-15 Automated Marking 
AC-6 Least Privilege AC-16 Automated Labeling 
AC-7 Unsuccessful Login Attempts AC-17 Remote Access 
AC-8 System Use Notification AC-18 Wireless Access Restrictions 
AC-9 Previous Logon Notification AC-19 Access Control for Portable 
and Mobile Devices 
AC-10 Concurrent Session Control AC-20 Use of External Information 
Systems 
Multiple access controls would have alleviat ed or prevented the attack, including:  AC-2 
ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT  “The organization manages information system accounts, 
including establishing, activating, modifying, reviewing, disabling, and removing accounts…”; 
AC-3 ACCESS ENFORCEMENT  “The information system enforces assigned 
authorizations for controlling access to the sy stem in accordance with applicable policy.”;  
AC-17 REMOTE ACCESS “ The organization documents, monitors , and controls all methods of 
remote access (e.g., dial-up, Internet) to the information system including remote access 
for privileged functions….”; AC-18 WIRELESS ACCESS RESTRICTIONS “ The organization: (i) 
establishes usage restrictions and implemen tation guidance for wireless technologies; and 
(ii) documents, monitors, and controls wireless access to the information system. ” With 
the enhancement “The organization uses authentication and encryption to protect wireless 
7/23/2008 4:15 PM 14 
access to the information system.”; and AC-20 USE OF EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS “the 
organization restricts the use of pers onally owned information systems.” 
Identification and Authentication 
Identification is the process of determining the identity of a user, process, or device, and 
authentication is the process of verifying the putative or claimed identity, often as a 
prerequisite to allowing access to  resources in an information system.  The Identification 
and Authentication family (IA) contains cont rols that would prevent unauthorized access 
to the control system:  
IA-1 Identification and Authentication Policy and Procedures IA-4 Identifier Management 
IA-2 User Identification and 
Authentication IA-5 Authenticator Management 
IA-3 Device Identification and 
Authentication IA-6 Authenticator Feedback 
IA-4 Identifier Management   
 
IA-2 USER IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION  “The information system uniquely identifies 
and authenticates users (or processes acting on behalf of users) … through the use of 
passwords, tokens, biometrics, or in the case of multifactor authentication, some combination therein….”; and 
IA-3 DEVICE IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION “ The 
information system identifies and authentic ates specific devices before establishing a 
connection, [using] either shared known in formation (e.g., Media Access Control (MAC) 
or Transmission Control Program/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) addresses) or an 
organizational authentication solution (e .g., IEEE 802.1x and Extensible Authentication 
Protocol (EAP) or a Radius  server with EAP-Trans port Layer Security (TLS) 
authentication)” are the primary controls.  IA-4 and IA-5 provide management for the 
parameters used. 
Portable Device Protection 
Part of defense-in-depth is r ecognizing that when some protections fail, there should be 
more controls to help protect the organiza tion.  Theft of portabl e electronic equipment 
occurs, often for the value of the equipment ra ther than the information stored.  Boden’s 
attack was an exception to this generality.    The control specified in MP-2, Media Acces s, is deceptively simple:  “The organization 
restricts access to information system media to authorized individuals.”  Supplemental 
guidance elaborates:  “Information system  media includes both digital media (e.g., 
diskettes, magnetic tapes, external/removable hard drives, flash/thumb drives, compact disks, digital video disks) and non-digital media (e.g., paper,  microfilm).  This control 
also applies to portable and mobile co mputing and communications devices with 
information storage capability (e.g., notebook computers, personal digital assistants, 
cellular telephones).  An organizational assessment of risk guides the selection of media 
and associated information contained on th at media requiring restricted access.  
7/23/2008 4:15 PM 15 
7/23/2008 4:15 PM 16 Organizations document in policy and procedures, the media requiring restricted access, 
individuals authorized to access the media, a nd the specific measures taken to restrict 
access.”   
System Monitoring 
Another part of defense-in-depth is dete rmining that something is going wrong.  The 
cause may be an intruder, often masquerading as an authorized user, or a malfunction.  SI-
4 INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES “The organization employs tools 
and techniques to monitor events on the info rmation system, detect attacks, and provide 
identification of unauthorized use of the syst em” provides a context for alerting personnel 
of a suspected anomaly.  If applied regularly  and systematically, the type of forensics 
performed by Hunter Watertech  and the poli ce might have detected the attack earlier. 
Conclusions 
The 2000 Maroochy Shire cyber event is important  because it provides a public record of 
an intentional, targeted atta ck by a knowledgeable person on an  industrial control system.  
The attack by an insider who is not an empl oyee demonstrates several critical physical, 
administrative, and supply chain vulnerabili ties of industrial contro l systems.  The key 
issue is the treatment of vulnerabilities co ming from suppliers or others outside the 
organization.  Contractor and sub-contractor personnel are often overlooked as a potential 
attack source.  The technical  issues demonstrate the diffi culty in identifying a control 
system cyber attack and retaking control of a “hijacked” system.  Once alerted to this type of attack, ICS owners and operators ma y have adequate controls to protect their 
assets.  However, a determined, knowledgeab le adversary such as  Vitek Boden could 
potentially defeat these controls.
