New Sandworm malware Cyclops Blink
replaces VPNFilter
The Sandworm actor has replaced the exposed VPNFilter malware with a new more
advanced framework.
Background
The UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), the Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the National Security Agency (NSA) and the
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the US have identified that the actor known
as Sandworm or Voodoo Bear is using a new malware, referred to here as Cyclops
Blink. The NCSC, CISA, FBI and NSA have previously attributed the Sandworm actor
to the Russian GRU’s Main Centre for Special Technologies GTsST.
The malicious cyber activity below has previously been attributed to Sandworm:
The BlackEnergy disruption of Ukrainian electricity in 2015
Industroyer in 2016
NotPetya in 2017
Attacks against the Winter Olympics and Paralympics in 2018
A series of disruptive attacks against Georgia in 2019
Cyclops Blink appears to be a replacement framework for the VPNFilter malware
exposed in 2018, which exploited network devices, primarily small office/home
office (SOHO) routers, and network attached storage (NAS) devices.
This advisory summarises the VPNFilter malware it replaces, and provides more
detail on Cyclops Blink, as well as the associated tactics, techniques and

procedures (TTPs) used by Sandworm. An NCSC malware analysis report on
Cyclops Blink is also available and can be read in parallel.
It also points to mitigation measures to help organisations that may be affected
by this malware.
VPNFilter
First exposed in 2018
A series of articles published by Cisco Talos in 2018 describes VPNFilter and its
modules in detail. VPNFilter was deployed in stages, with most functionality in the
third-stage modules. These modules enabled traffic manipulation, destruction of
the infected host device, and likely enabled downstream devices to be exploited.
They also allowed monitoring of Modbus SCADA protocols, which appears to be an
ongoing requirement for Sandworm, as also seen in their previous attacks against
ICS networks.
VPNFilter targeting was widespread and appeared indiscriminate, with some
exceptions: Cisco Talos reported an increase of victims in Ukraine in May 2018.
Sandworm also deployed VPNFilter against targets in the Republic of Korea before
the 2018 Winter Olympics.
In May 2018 Cisco Talos published the blog that exposed VPNFilter, and the US
Department of Justice linked the activity to Sandworm, and announced its
disruption of the botnet.
Activity since its exposure 
A Trendmicro blog in January 2021 detailed residual VPNFilter infections and
provided data showing a reduction in requests to a known C2 domain. Since the
disruption in May 2018, Sandworm has shown limited interest in existing VPNFilter
footholds, instead preferring to retool.

Cyclops Blink
Active since 2019
The NCSC, CISA, FBI and NSA, along with industry partners, have now identified a
large-scale modular malware framework which is affecting network devices. The
new malware is referred to here as Cyclops Blink and has been deployed since at
least June 2019, fourteen months after VPNFilter was disrupted. In common with
VPNFilter, Cyclops Blink deployment also appears indiscriminate and widespread.
The actor has so far primarily deployed Cyclops Blink to WatchGuard devices, but
it is likely that Sandworm would be capable of compiling the malware for other
architectures and firmware.
Note:
Note that only WatchGuard devices that were reconfigured from the manufacturer
default settings to open remote management interfaces to external access could be
infected
Malware overview
The malware itself is sophisticated and modular with basic core functionality to
beacon (T1132.002) device information back to a server and enable files to be
downloaded and executed. There is also functionality to add new modules while
the malware is running, which allows Sandworm to implement additional
capability as required.
The NCSC has published a malware analysis report on Cyclops Blink which provides
more detail about the malware.

Post exploitation
Post exploitation, Cyclops Blink is generally deployed as part of a firmware ‘update’
(T1542.001). This achieves persistence when the device is rebooted and makes
remediation harder. 
Victim devices are organised into clusters and each deployment of Cyclops Blink
has a list of command and control (C2) IP addresses and ports that it uses (T1008).
All the known C2 IP addresses to date have been used by compromised
WatchGuard firewall devices. Communications between Cyclops Blink clients and
servers are protected under Transport Layer Security (TLS) (T1071.001), using
individually generated keys and certificates. Sandworm manages Cyclops Blink by
connecting to the C2 layer through the Tor network:
Mitigation
Cyclops Blink persists on reboot and throughout the legitimate firmware update
process. Affected organisations should therefore take steps to remove the

malware. 
WatchGuard has worked closely with the FBI, CISA and the NCSC, and has provided
tooling and guidance to enable detection and removal of Cyclops Blink on
WatchGuard devices through a non-standard upgrade process.  Device owners
should follow each step in these instructions to ensure that devices are patched
to the latest version and that any infection is removed.
The WatchGuard tooling and guidance is available
at: https://detection.watchguard.com/
In addition:
If your device is identified as infected with Cyclops Blink, you should assume
that any passwords present on the device have been compromised and
replace them (see NCSC password guidance for organisations).
You should ensure that the management interface of network devices is not
exposed to the internet.

Conclusion
A Cyclops Blink infection does not mean that an organisation is the primary target,
but it may be selected to be, or its machines could be used to conduct attacks.
Organisations are advised to follow the mitigation advice in this advisory and to
refer to indicators of compromise (not exhaustive) in the Cyclops Blink malware
analysis report to detect possible activity on networks.
UK organisations affected by the activity outlined in this advisory should report
any compromises to the NCSC via our website.
Further guidance
A variety of mitigations will be of use in defending against the malware featured in
this advisory:
Do not expose management interfaces of network devices to the internet
the management interface is a significant attack surface, so not exposing them reduces
the risk. See NCSC guidance: Acquiring, managing and disposing of network devices
Protect your devices and networks by keeping them up to date
use the latest supported versions, apply security patches promptly, use anti-virus and
scan regularly to guard against known malware threats. See NCSC guidance: Mitigating
malware
Use multi-factor authentication to reduce the impact of password compromises

see NCSC guidance: Multi-factor authentication for online services and Setting up 2-Step
Verification (2SV)
Treat people as your first line of  defence
tell staff how to report suspected phishing emails, and ensure they feel confident to do
so. Investigate their reports promptly and thoroughly. Never punish users for clicking
phishing links or opening attachments. See NCSC guidance: Phishing attacks: defending
your organisation
Set up a security monitoring capability
so you are collecting the data needed to analyse network intrusions. See NCSC guidance:
