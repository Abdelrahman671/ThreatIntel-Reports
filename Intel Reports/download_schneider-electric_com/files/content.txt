APT Cyber Tools Targeting ICS/SCADA Devices  
13 April 2022  (14-Apr-22) 
Overview  
Schneider Electric, working in close collaboration with the United States Department of Energy, 
Homeland Security, and cybersecurity defense partner, Mandiant, identified and developed 
protective measures to defend against an APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) Cyberattack 
Tools/Framework  still in development that would target a set of our Programmable Logic 
Controllers (PLCs) . The following analysis and protective measures come from this public -
private partnership collaboration. In addition, t his Security Bulletin includes a range of technical 
analytics, hunting tools, and specific mitigations to help asset owners find and defend against 
the framework.  
The collaboration between private -sector cyber experts (Mandiant) and the affected Original 
Equipment Manufacturer (Schneider Electric)  and Government agencies  led to higher -
confidence mitigations for protecting stakeholders.  This is an instance of successful 
collaboration to deter threats on critical infrastructure before they occur and further underscores 
how public -private partnerships  are instrumental in detecting and countering threats before they 
can be deployed proactively . 
Schneider Electric is committed to working together  with Government s and Partners to advance 
our shared goal of protecting our customers, communities, and the environment from all serious 
cybersecurity threats.  
Details 
In early 2022, Mandiant, in partnership with Schneider Electric, analyzed a set of novel industrial 
control system (ICS) -oriented attack tools —which they call INCONTROLLER, and also tracked  
as PIPEDREAM by Dragos —built to target machine automation devices. The framework can 
interact with specific industrial equipment embedded in different types of machinery leveraged 
across multiple industries.  
While we are not a ware , at the date of this publication,  of any confirmed or potential targets 
leveraging INCONTROLLER , the framework poses a critical risk to organizations using the 
targeted devices .  The framework has capabilities related to disruption, sabotage, and 
potentially physical destruction.  
If the f ramework is used against one of the targeted devices, it would allow for use of the same 
standard features as the programming tool or Modbus client or OPC -UA client. Any action that 
can be performed by an attacker using a legitimate programming tool or modbus client can 
likewise be performed using the framework. Other than that, we have not  identified any 
weakness or vulnerability being exploited. Depending on the features utilized in the framework and the security features configured on the device, an attacker can perform actions such as:  
•Perform a network scan to discover the device
•Change the IP address to communicate with the framework or make the devic
e
unr
eachable

•Send Modbus  frame (standard or proprietary)
•Automate connection to PLC in order to bruteforce the password  using standar d
pr
ogramming protocols
•Upload and download files (configuration, firmware, application, recipes , etc)
•Execute denial of service attacks to force the user to authenticate again or make t he
dev
ice unreachable
•Perform read /write to OPC -UA server
P
otentially Targeted Products  
The i
nvestigated version of the framework contains information that indicates the potential to 
impact the following Schneider Electric devices:  
Product  Versions  
TM221  All 
TM241/TM251  All 
TM258 /LMC058  All 
LMC078  All 
TM238  All 
PacDrive  LMC  All 
The framework has the ability to communicate with all versions of Modbus  and C ODES YS 
devices.  This includes devices managed by EcoStruxure Machine Expert software  and 
SoMachine software .  Microgrid Operation (EMO -M) could also be potentially targeted, as the 
programming tool for TM251 (PLC of EMO -M solution) is EcoS truxure Machine Expert (E SME) 
and the core of E SME is CODESYS. 
R
ecommended Mitigations  
Customers should immediately implement the following recommendations to protect their 
Schneider Electric devices:  
•Update EcoS truxure Machine Expert and EcoS truxure Machine Expert Basic to the
latest versions  using Schneider Electric Software Update software or with following links :
oEcoStruxure Machine Expert
oEcoStruxure Machine Expert -Basic
•Update firmware of your programmable logic controllers:
oUsing Controller Assistant for  Machine Expert devices
oUsing Controller Update feature in Commissioning tab of EcoStru xure Machi ne
E
xpert Basic
•For TM221, set up a strong password for read/ write of application in the “ Applicati on
Pr
otection page
•For Machine Expert programmable logic controllers, replace default account with your
own and set up a strong password
•Disable unused protocol in the device’ s Ethernet pages, especially:

o(Auto) Discovery protocol  (UDP ports 27126, 27127 and 3702)
oPrograming protocol  (TCP port 502 for T M221)
oMachine Expert protocol (UDP ports 1740 to 1743, TCP ports 1105 and 11740)
oModbus protocol (TCP port 502)
•Check that the application on the device has not been modified .
A
dditionally, the Cybersecurity Guidelines for EcoStruxure Machine Expert, Modicon and  
PacDrive Controllers and Associated Equipment User Guide  should be used to harden your 
Schneider Electric product.  
Y
ou should pay special attention to features and cybersecurity devices that help to restrict 
access to authorized users only. Some examples are the Intrusion Detection System, network 
firewalls, secure remote access, device authentication, device firewall, disabling/filtering 
unsecure or programming protocols.   
W
e recommend our customers to check the TTP section on the CISA advisory  t o map to the 
MITRE ATT&CK for ICS framework.  
General Security Recommendations 
We strongly recommend the following industry cybersecurity best practices.  
•Locate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls  and
i
solate them from the business network.
•Install physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access your industrial control
and safety systems, components, peripheral equipment, and networks.
•Place all controllers in locked cabinets and never leave them in the “Program” mode.
•Have a recovery strategy ; test your backups frequently.
•Employ Defense in Depth strategy to protect your environment and assets.
•Never connect programming software to any network other than the network intended forthat device.
•Scan all methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network such as CDs, USB
drives, etc. before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks.
•Never allow mobile devices that have connected to any other network besides the
intended network to connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation.
•Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and systems and ensure thatthey are not accessible from the Internet.
•When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks
(VPNs). Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to t
he
m
ost current version available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the
connected devic es.

Practices  document.
