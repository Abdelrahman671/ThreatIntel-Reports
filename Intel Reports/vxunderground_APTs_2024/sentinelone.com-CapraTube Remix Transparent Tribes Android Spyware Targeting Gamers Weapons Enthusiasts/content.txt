CapraTube Remix | Transparent Tribe’s Android Spyware Targeting
Gamers, Weapons Enthusiasts
Alex Delamotte ⋮
Executive Summary
SentinelLabs has identified four new CapraRAT APKs associated with suspected Pakistan state-aligned actor
Transparent Tribe.
These APKs continue the group’s trend of embedding spyware into curated video browsing applications, with a
new expansion targeting mobile gamers, weapons enthusiasts, and TikTok fans.
The overall functionality remains the same, with the underlying code updated to better suit modern Android
devices.
Overview
Transparent Tribe (aka APT 36, Operation C-Major) has been active since at least 2016 with attacks against Indian
government and military personnel. The group relies heavily on social engineering attacks to deliver a variety of
Windows and Android spyware, including spear-phishing and watering hole attacks.
In September 2023, SentinelLabs outlined the CapraTube campaign, which used weaponized Android applications
(APK) designed to mimic YouTube, often in a suspected dating context due to the nature of the videos served. The
activity highlighted in this report shows the continuation of this technique with updates to the social engineering
pretexts as well as efforts to maximize the spyware’s compatibility with older versions of the Android operating system
while expanding the attack surface to include modern versions of Android.

New CapraRAT app logos
The new versions of CapraRAT each use WebView to launch a URL to either YouTube or a mobile gaming site,
CrazyGames[.]com. There is no indication that an app with the same name, Crazy Games, is weaponized as it
does not require several key CapraRAT permissions, such as sending SMS, making calls, accessing contacts, or
recording audio and video. The URL query in the CapraRAT code is obfuscated as
htUUtps://www.youUUtube.com/resulUUts?seUUarch_quUUery=TiUUk+ToUUks, which is cleaned to
remove occurrences of UU, resulting in https[:]//www.youtube[.]com/results?
search_query=Tik+Toks.

The previous CapraTube campaign had one APK called Piya Sharma that was likely used in a romance-themed
social engineering pretext. The new campaign continues that trend with the Sexy Videos app. While two of the
previously reported apps launched only YouTube with no query, the YouTube apps from this campaign are each
preloaded with a query related to the application’s theme. The TikTok app launches YouTube with the query “Tik
Toks,” and the Weapons app launches the Forgotten Weapons YouTube channel, which reviews a variety of classic
arms and has 2.7 Million subscribers.

TikTok and Weapons-themed CapraRAT YouTube WebView
The Crazy Games app launches WebView to load CrazyGames[.]com, a site containing in-browser mini games.
This particularly resource-intensive site did not work well on older versions of Android during our testing.

Crazy Games CapraRAT WebView
When the app first launches, the user is prompted to grant several risky permissions, including:
Access GPS location
Manage network state
Read and send SMS
Read contacts
Record audio and screen, take screenshots
Storage read and write access
Use camera
View call history and make calls
In contrast with the previous CapraRAT campaign, the following Android permissions are no longer requested or
used:
READ_INSTALL_SESSIONS
GET_ACCOUNTS
AUTHENTICATE_ACCOUNTS

REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES
The reduction in permissions suggests the app developers are focused on making CapraRAT a surveillance tool
more than a fully featured backdoor.
App Compatibility
The most significant changes between this campaign and the September 2023 campaign are to app compatibility.
The newest CapraRAT APKs we identified now contain references to Android’s Oreo version (Android 8.0), which
was released in 2017. Previous versions relied on the device running Lollipop (Android 5.1), which was released in
2015 and less likely to be compatible with modern Android devices.
We tested the APKs from this campaign and the September 2023 campaign on an Android device running Android
Tiramisu aka Android 13 (2022) and Android 14 (2023). The new campaign’s apps ran smoothly on this modern
version of Android. The September 2023 campaign apps prompted a compatibility warning dialog, which could raise
suspicion among victims that the app is abnormal. When running on the newest released version of Android 14, the
September 2023 campaign’s Piya Sharma app fails to install. Each of the newer versions ran successfully.
In all cases, the app still requests gratuitous permissions from the user that hint to the tool’s capabilities. Even if the
user declines permissions, the app still runs, meaning the group has not overcome this hurdle to successfully
implementing their spyware.

The new CapraRAT packages also contain a very minimal new class called WebView, which is responsible for
maintaining compatibility with older versions of Android via the Android Support Library, which developers can choose
to include in a project to enhance compatibility.
Spyware Activities and C2
The app’s MainActivity initiates requests for permissions. The app still runs even if permissions are not granted.
MainActivity calls the TCHPClient class, which contains the malicious capabilities leveraged by CapraRAT. This
class drives several spyware classes and methods, including:
audioStreamer (aStreamer)
CallLogLister
CallReceiver
ContactsLister
DirLister (file browsing)
downloadFile
killFile (file deletion)
killProcess
PhotoTaker
SMSLister
SMSReceiver
These give the spyware fine-grained control over what the user does on the device.
The sendData method is responsible for constructing the data collected by other methods and classes and sending
it to the C2. The mRun method constructs the socket and sends the data to the C2 server using the variables
specified in the Settings class. Each of the current campaign’s APKs use the same C2 server hostname, IP
address and TCP port number 18582. The Settings class also shows the same CapraRAT version identifier for
each APK, A.D.0.2.
6/7
mRun performs a connectivity check to decide whether to connect to the C2 using the hostname shareboxs[.]net
or the hardcoded IP address 173[.]249[.]50[.]243. This IP address has been tied to Transparent Tribe’s
CrimsonRAT and AhMyth Android RAT C2 activity since at least 2022. As of this writing, shareboxs[.]net
resolves to 173[.]212[.]206[.]227.
Conclusion
The updates to the CapraRAT code between the September 2023 campaign and the current campaign are minimal,
but suggest the developers are focused on making the tool more reliable and stable. The decision to move to newer
versions of the Android OS are logical, and likely align with the group’s sustained targeting of individuals in the Indian
government or military space, who are unlikely to use devices running older versions of Android, such as Lollipop
which was released 8 years ago.
The APK theme updates show the group continues to lean into its social engineering prowess to gain a wider
audience of targets who would be interested in the new app lures, such as mobile gamers or weapons enthusiasts.
To help prevent compromise by CapraRAT and similar malware, users should always evaluate the permissions
requested by an app to determine if they are necessary. For example, an app that only displays TikTok videos does
not need the ability to send SMS messages, make calls, or record the screen. In incident response scenarios, treat
the related network indicators of compromise as suspect, including the use of port 18582, and search suspect apps
for the presence of strings using the unique method names outlined in the Spyware Activities & C2 section of this
report.
