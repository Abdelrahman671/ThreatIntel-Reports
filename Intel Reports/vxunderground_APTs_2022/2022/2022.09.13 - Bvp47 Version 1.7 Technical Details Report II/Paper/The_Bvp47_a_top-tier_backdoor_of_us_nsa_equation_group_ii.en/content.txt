1. Executive Summary
In report " Bvp47 – A Top-tier Backdoor of US NSA Equation Group " (Reference 1), Bvp47 is like a huge 
shell or compressed package, containing a total of 18 fragments. Pangu Labs gives attribution analysis 
and description of some technical details, such as BPF covert tunneling. However, there are still some 
other modules worth in-depth analysis. Those modules can either perform functions together as part of 
Bvp47 or be used independently.
In a forensic to Solaris system of one critical infrastructure in 2015, Pangu Lab extracted another sample, 
which survived independently on the Solaris platform and seemed to be closely related to Bvp47. After 
analyzing the leaked information, we confirmed that the content of the sample file was same to Suction-
char_Agent which was leaked from The Shadow Brokers. When executed with dewdrops, incision and 
other modules, it can easily steal password of target system, when user is executing commands like ssh, 
passwd, sudo. The file stored stolen passwords in target system also requires private key of RSA algorithm 
for decryption.
The process of tracking Bvp47 is more like exploring a puzzle under fog. This report will further illustrate 
parts of working method and execution logic of Bvp47, a top-tier backdoor platform, through analysis of 
Suctionchar_Agent, Dewdrop, and Bvp47_loader.

2. Attack Scene Restoration of 
    suctionchar_agent 
After repeated attempts and tracking of the execution process, Pangu Lab roughly restored attack scene 
of suctionchar_agent combining with other components, as shown in following figure:
1. The sum module running in the kernel layer will assist suctionchar_agent to steal account passwords  
    from processes such as PASSWD, TELNET, and SU;
2. The stolen credentials will be synchronized to suctionchar_agent running on Ring3;
3. suctionchar_agent will save the stolen credentials to hidden directory of "/var/tmp/.xxxxxxxx";
4. Attacker remotely sends trigger packet, that runs ish callback, to the BPF filter at the kernel layer;
5. The BPF filter captures the featured packet and transmits it to dewdrop in Ring3;
6. Dewdrop decrypts the data packet to obtain the ish callback command, and forwards it to incision  
    program;

7. The incision program actively executes callback command to contact C&C server, and the attacker uses   
    ish to obtain the password file;
8. The attacker decrypts the password file with RSA private key and then obtains stolen passwords

File Information
In on-site environment, we extracted one program in Solaris Sparc architecture. After comparing it with the 
leaked Shadow Brokers data, we confirmed the connection. The file related information is as follows:
The CPU adaptation architecture of the sample obtained at the on-site environment is SPARC. Through 
correlation and attribution analysis, we found that the sample is one of the files leaked by The Shadow Bro-
kers, namely suctionchar_agent__v__3.3.7.9_sparc-sun-solaris2.9. However, good decompiler targeting 
SPARC architecture is not available currently. Since there are homologous binary programs suitable for 
multiple platforms in the leaked file package, we refer one sample with the same function of the x86 archi-
tecture for analysis. The specific file information of the x86 architecture is as follows:

The file "Linux\etc\opscript.txt" has a description of suctionchar’s function. It steals account and password 
in programs such as SSH, TELNET, FTP, PASSWD, SU, RSH, LOGIN, and CSH. The suctionchar_agent 
program is just an application layer agent, which communicates with the associated kernel module to 
obtain the required information and encrypts it and writes it to a file. The kernel module sum file (not includ-
ed in The Shadow Brokers Leaks) can be loaded by the modload program. After the kernel module is suc-
cessfully loaded, the dropped files will be deleted to prevent the content from being restored:

6. Conclusion
Although the function implementation of the Suctionchar_Agent module is relatively simple, combining 
Bvp47_loader and Dewdrop, we can conclude that Bvp47 has a good architectural capability in design, 
and attackers can flexibly combine other functional modules to achieve attack targets and reduce exposed 
surface of malicious code as much as possible. Although the NSA-sourced attack activities are highly 
secretive, through the analysis of forensic materials within the scope of our own data and the in-depth 
mining of open source data, we still hope to complete our puzzle and get a glimpse of the operation meth-
ods of the top international hacker teams.
