Joint Cybersecurity Advisory

People's Republic of China State-Sponsored Cyber 
Actor Living off the Land to Evade Detection 
Summary 
The United States and international cybersecurity authorities are issuing this joint 
Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) to highlight a recently discovered cluster of activity of 
interest associated with a People’s Republic of China (PRC) state-sponsored cyber 
actor, also known as Volt Typhoon. Private sector partners have identified that this 
activity affects networks across U.S. critical infrastructure sectors, and the authoring 
agencies believe the actor could apply the same techniques against these and other 
sectors worldwide.  
This advisory from the United States National Security Agency (NSA), the U.S. 
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the U.S. Federal Bureau of 
Investigation (FBI), the Australian Signals Directorate’s Australian Cyber Security 
Centre (ACSC), the Communications Security Establishment’s Canadian Centre for 
Cyber Security (CCCS), the New Zealand National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-NZ), 
and the United Kingdom National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-UK) (hereafter referred 
to as the “authoring agencies”) provides an overview of hunting guidance and 
associated best practices to detect this activity. 
One of the actor’s primary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) is living off the 
land, which uses built-in network administration tools to perform their objectives. This 
TTP allows the actor to evade detection by blending in with normal Windows system 
and network activities, avoid endpoint detection and response (EDR) products that 
would alert on the introduction of third-party applications to the host, and limit the 
amount of activity that is captured in default logging configurations. Some of the built-in 
tools this actor uses are: wmic, ntdsutil, netsh, and PowerShell. The advisory

provides examples of the actor’s commands along with detection signatures to aid 
network defenders in hunting for this activity. Many of the behavioral indicators included 
can also be legitimate system administration commands that appear in benign activity. 
Care should be taken not to assume that findings are malicious without further 
investigation or other indications of compromise.

Technical Details 
This advisory uses the MITRE ATT&CK for Enterprise framework, version 13. See the 
Appendix: MITRE ATT&CK Techniques for all referenced tactics and techniques.  
Background 
The authoring agencies are aware of recent People’s Republic of China (PRC) state-
sponsored cyber activity and have identified potential indicators associated with these 
techniques. This advisory will help net defenders hunt for this activity on their systems. 
It provides many network and host artifacts associated with the activity occurring after 
the network has been initially compromised, with a focus on command lines used by the 
cyber actor. An Indicators of compromise (IOCs) summary is included at the end of this 
advisory. For a downloadable copy of IOCs, see aa23-144a.stix_.xml (STIX, 35 kB). 
Especially for living off the land techniques, it is possible that some command lines 
might appear on a system as the result of benign activity and would be false positive 
indicators of malicious activity. Defenders must evaluate matches to determine their 
significance, applying their knowledge of the system and baseline behavior. 
Additionally, if creating detection logic based on these commands, network defenders 
should account for variability in command string arguments, as items such as ports 
used may differ across environments. 
Artifacts 
Network artifacts 
The actor has leveraged compromised small office/home office (SOHO) network 
devices as intermediate infrastructure to obscure their activity by having much of the 
command and control (C2) traffic emanate from local ISPs in the geographic area of the 
victim. Owners of SOHO devices should ensure that network management interfaces 
are not exposed to the Internet to avoid them being re-purposed as redirectors by 
malicious actors. If they must be exposed to the Internet, device owners and operators 
should ensure they follow zero trust principles and maintain the highest level of 
authentication and access controls possible. 
The actor has used Earthworm and a custom Fast Reverse Proxy (FRP) client with 
hardcoded C2 callbacks [T1090] to ports 8080, 8443, 8043, 8000, and 10443 with

various filenames including, but not limited to: cisco_up.exe, cl64.exe, vm3dservice.exe, 
watchdogd.exe, Win.exe, WmiPreSV.exe, and WmiPrvSE.exe. 
Host artifacts 
Windows management instrumentation (WMI/WMIC) 
The actor has executed the following command to gather information about local drives 
[T1082]: 
cmd.exe /C "wmic path win32_logicaldisk get 
caption,filesystem,freespace,size,volumename" 
This command does not require administrative credentials to return results. The 
command uses a command prompt [T1059.003] to execute a Windows Management 
Instrumentation Command Line (WMIC) query, collecting information about the storage 
devices on the local host, including drive letter, file system (e.g., new technology file 
system [NTFS]), free space and drive size in bytes, and an optional volume name. 
Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) is a built-in Windows tool that allows a 
user to access management information from hosts in an enterprise environment. The 
command line version of WMI is called WMIC. 
By default, WMI Tracing is not enabled, so the WMI commands being executed and the 
associated user might not be available. Additional information on WMI events and 
tracing can be found in the References section of the advisory.  
Ntds.dit Active Directory database 
The actor may try to exfiltrate the ntds.dit file and the SYSTEM registry hive from 
Windows domain controllers (DCs) out of the network to perform password cracking 
[T1003.003]. (The ntds.dit file is the main Active Directory (AD) database file and, by 
default, is stored at %SystemRoot%\NTDS\ntds.dit. This file contains information 
about users, groups, group memberships, and password hashes for all users in the 
domain; the SYSTEM registry hive contains the boot key that is used to encrypt 
information in the ntds.dit file.) Although the ntds.dit file is locked while in use by AD, a 
copy can be made by creating a Volume Shadow Copy and extracting the ntds.dit file 
from the Shadow Copy. The SYSTEM registry hive may also be obtained from the 
Shadow Copy. The following example commands show the actor creating a Shadow 
Copy and then extracting a copy of the ntds.dit file from it.

S\ntds.dit C:\Windows\Temp > C:\Windows\Temp\<filename>.tmp 
The built-in Ntdsutil.exe tool performs all these actions using a single command. There 
are several ways to execute Ntdsutil.exe, including running from an elevated command 
prompt (cmd.exe), using WMI/WMIC, or PowerShell. Defenders should look for the 
execution of Ntdsutil.exe commands using long, short, or a combination of the 
notations. For example, the long notation command activate instance ntds ifm 
can also be executed using the short notation ac i ntds i. Table 1 provides the long 
and short forms of the arguments used in the sample Ntdsutil.exe command, along with 
a brief description of the arguments.

The actor has executed WMIC commands [T1047] to create a copy of the ntds.dit file 
and SYSTEM registry hive using ntdsutil.exe. Each of the following actor commands is 
a standalone example; multiple examples are provided to show how syntax and file 
paths may differ per environment.

cmd.exe /Q /c wmic process call create "cmd.exe /c mkdir 
C:\Windows\Temp\tmp & ntdsutil \"ac i ntds\" ifm \"create 
full C:\Windows\Temp\tmp\"  1> 
\\127.0.0.1\ADMIN$\<timestamp value> 2>&1 
Note: The <timestamp value> would be an epoch timestamp following the format 
like “__1684956600.123456”. 
Each actor command above creates a copy of the ntds.dit database and the SYSTEM 
and SECURITY registry hives in the C:\Windows\Temp\<folder> directory, where 
<folder> is replaced with the path specified in the command (e.g., pro, tmp, or 
McAfee_Logs). By default, the hidden ADMIN$ share is mapped to C:\Windows\, so 
the last command will direct standard output and error messages from the command to 
a file within the folder specified. 
The actor has also saved the files directly to the C:\Windows\Temp and 
C:\Users\Public directories, so the entirety of those directory structures should be 
analyzed. Ntdsutil.exe creates two subfolders in the directory specified in the command: 
an Active Directory folder that contains the ntds.dit and ntds.jfm files, and a registry 
folder that contains the SYSTEM and SECURITY hives. Defenders should look for this 
folder structure across their network: 
<path specified in command>\Active Directory\ntds.dit 
<path specified in command>\Active Directory\ntds.jfm 
<path specified in command>\registry\SECURITY 
<path specified in command>\registry\SYSTEM 
When one of the example commands is executed, several successive log entries are 
created in the Application log, under the ESENT Source. Associated events can be 
viewed in Windows Event Viewer by navigating to: Windows Logs | Application. To 
narrow results to relevant events, select Filter Current Log from the Actions menu on 
the right side of the screen. In the Event sources dropdown, check the box next to 
ESENT, then limit the logs to ID numbers 216, 325, 326, and 327. Clicking the OK box 
will apply the filters to the results. 
Since ESENT logging is used extensively throughout Windows, defenders should focus 
on events that reference ntds.dit. If such events are present, the events’ details should 
contain the file path where the file copies were created. Since these files can be

deleted, or enhanced logging may not be configured on hosts, the file path can greatly 
aid in a hunt operation. Identifying the user associated with this activity is also a critical 
step in a hunt operation as other actions by the compromised—or actor-created—user 
account can be helpful to understand additional actor TTPs, as well as the breadth of 
the actor's actions. 
Note: If an actor can exfiltrate the ntds.dit and SYSTEM registry hive, the entire domain 
should be considered compromised, as the actor will generally be able to crack the 
password hashes for domain user accounts, create their own accounts, and/or join 
unauthorized systems to the domain. If this occurs, defenders should follow guidance 
for removing malicious actors from victim networks, such as CISA's Eviction Guidance 
for Network Affected by the SolarWinds and Active Directory/M365 Compromise. 
In addition to the above TTPs used by the actor to copy the ntds.dit file, the following 
tools could be used by an actor to obtain the same information: 
 
Secretsdump.py 
 Note: This script is a component of Impacket, which the actor has been 
known to use 
 
Invoke-NinjaCopy (PowerShell) 
 
DSInternals (PowerShell) 
 
FgDump 
 
Metasploit 
Best practices for securing ntds.dit include hardening Domain Controllers and 
monitoring event logs for ntdsutil.exe and similar process creations. Additionally, any 
use of administrator privileges should be audited and validated to confirm the legitimacy 
of executed commands.  
PortProxy 
The actor has used the following commands to enable port forwarding [T1090] on the 
host: 
"cmd.exe /c "netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 
listenaddress=0.0.0.0 listenport=9999 
connectaddress=<rfc1918 internal ip address> 
connectport=8443 protocol=tcp""

TLP:CLEAR 
 
"cmd.exe /c netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 
listenport=50100 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 connectport=1433 
connectaddress=<rfc1918 internal ip address>" 
where <rfc1918 internal ip address> is replaced with an IPv4 address 
internal to the network, omitting the < >’s. 
Netsh is a built-in Windows command line scripting utility that can display or modify the 
network settings of a host, including the Windows Firewall. The portproxy add command 
is used to create a host:port proxy that will forward incoming connections on the 
provided listenaddress and listenport to the connectaddress and connectport. 
Administrative privileges are required to execute the portproxy command. Each 
portproxy command above will create a registry key in the 
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\PortProxy\v4tov4\tcp\ path. 
Defenders should look for the presences of keys in this path and investigate any 
anomalous entries. 
Note: Using port proxies is not common for legitimate system administration since they 
can constitute a backdoor into the network that bypasses firewall policies. 
Administrators should limit port proxy usage within environments and only enable them 
for the period of time in which they are required. 
Defenders should also use unusual IP addresses and ports in the command lines or 
registry entries to identify other hosts that are potentially included in actor actions. All 
hosts on the network should be examined for new and unusual firewall and port 
forwarding rules, as well as IP addresses and ports specified by the actor. If network 
traffic or logging is available, defenders should attempt to identify what traffic was 
forwarded though the port proxies to aid in the hunt operation. As previously mentioned, 
identifying the associated user account that made the networking changes can also aid 
in the hunt operation. 
Firewall rule additions and changes can be viewed in Windows Event Viewer by 
navigating to: Applications and Service Logs | Microsoft | Windows | 
Windows Firewall With Advanced Security | Firewall. 
In addition to host-level changes, defenders should review perimeter firewall 
configurations for unauthorized changes and/or entries that may permit external

TLP:CLEAR 
 
connections to internal hosts. The actor is known to target perimeter devices in their 
operations. Firewall logs should be reviewed for any connections to systems on the 
ports listed in any portproxy commands discovered. 
PowerShell 
The actor has used the following PowerShell [T1059.001] command to identify 
successful logons to the host [T1033]: 
Get-EventLog security -instanceid 4624  
Note: Event ID 4624 is logged when a user successfully logs on to a host and 
contains useful information such as the logon type (e.g., interactive or 
networking), associated user and computer account names, and the logon time. 
Event ID 4624 entries can be viewed in Windows Event Viewer by navigating to: 
Windows Logs | Security. PowerShell logs can be viewed in Event Viewer: 
Applications and Service Logs | Windows PowerShell. 
This command identifies what user account they are currently leveraging to access the 
network, identify other users logged on to the host, or identify how their actions are 
being logged. If the actor is using a password spray technique [T1110.003], there may 
be several failed logon (Event ID 4625) events for several different user accounts, 
followed by one or more successful logons (Event ID 4624) within a short period of time. 
This period may vary by actor but can range from a few seconds to a few minutes.  
If the actor is using brute force password attempts [T1110] against a single user 
account, there may be several Event ID 4625 entries for that account, followed by a 
successful logon Event ID 4624. Defenders should also look for abnormal account 
activity, such as logons outside of normal working hours and impossible time-and-
distance logons (e.g., a user logging on from two geographically separated locations at 
the same time). 
Impacket 
The actor regularly employs the use of Impacket’s wmiexec, which redirects output to a 
file within the victim host’s ADMIN$ share (C:\Windows\) containing an epoch 
timestamp in its name. The following is an example of the “dir” command being 
executed by wmiexec.py:

cmd.exe /Q /c dir 1>  
\\127.0.0.1\ADMIN$\__1684956600.123456 2>&1 
 
Note: Discovery of an entry similar to the example above in the Windows Event 
Log and/or a file with a name in a similar format may be evidence of malicious 
activity and should be investigated further. In the event that only a filename is 
discovered, the epoch timestamp within the filename reflects the time of 
execution by default and can be used to help scope threat hunting activities. 
Enumeration of the environment 
The following commands were used by the actor to enumerate the network topology 
[T1016], the active directory structure [T1069.002], and other information about the 
target environment [T1069.001], [T1082]:

Mitigations 
The authoring agencies recommend organizations implement the mitigations below to 
improve your organization’s cybersecurity posture on the basis of the threat actor’s 
activity. These mitigations align with the Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals 
(CPGs) developed by CISA and the National Institute of Standards and Technology 
(NIST). The CPGs provide a minimum set of practices and protections that CISA and 
NIST recommend all organizations implement. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on 
existing cybersecurity Frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common 
and impactful threats and TTPs. Visit CISA’s Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance 
Goals for more information on the CPGs, including additional recommended baseline 
protections. 
 Defenders should harden domain controllers and monitor event logs [2.T] for 
ntdsutil.exe and similar process creations. Additionally, any use of administrator 
privileges should be audited and validated to confirm the legitimacy of executed 
commands. 
 Administrators should limit port proxy usage within environments and only enable 
them for the period of time in which they are required [2.X]. 
 Defenders should investigate unusual IP addresses and ports in command lines, 
registry entries, and firewall logs to identify other hosts that are potentially 
involved in actor actions.

 In addition to host-level changes, defenders should review perimeter firewall 
configurations for unauthorized changes and/or entries that may permit external 
connections to internal hosts. 
 Defenders should also look for abnormal account activity, such as logons outside 
of normal working hours and impossible time-and-distance logons (e.g., a user 
logging on from two geographically separated locations at the same time). 
 Defenders should forward log files to a hardened centralized logging server, 
preferably on a segmented network [2.F]. 
Logging recommendations  
To be able to detect the activity described in this CSA, defenders should set the audit 
policy for Windows security logs to include “audit process creation” and “include 
command line in process creation events” in addition to accessing the logs. 
Otherwise, the default logging configurations may not contain the necessary 
information. 
Enabling these options will create Event ID 4688 entries in the Windows Security log to 
view command line processes. Given the cost and difficulty of logging and analyzing 
this kind of activity, if an organization must limit the requirements, they should focus on 
enabling this kind of logging on systems that are externally facing or perform 
authentication or authorization, especially including domain controllers. 
To hunt for the malicious WMI and PowerShell activity, defenders should also log WMI 
and PowerShell events. By default, WMI Tracing and deep PowerShell logging are not 
enabled, but they can be enabled by following the configuration instructions linked in the 
References section.  
The actor takes measures to hide their tracks, such as clearing logs [T1070.001]. To 
ensure log integrity and availability, defenders should forward log files to a hardened 
centralized logging server, preferably on a segmented network. Such an architecture 
makes it harder for an actor to cover their tracks as evidence of their actions will be 
captured in multiple locations.  
Defenders should also monitor logs for Event ID 1102, which is generated when the 
audit log is cleared. All Event ID 1102 entries should be investigated as logs are

generally not cleared and this is a known actor tactic to cover their tracks. Even if an 
event log is cleared on a host, if the logs are also stored on a logging server, the copy of 
the log will be preserved. 
This activity is often linked to malicious exploitation of edge devices and network 
management devices. Defenders should enable logging on their edge devices, to 
include system logs, to be able to identify potential exploitation and lateral movement. 
They should also enable network-level logging, such as sysmon, webserver, 
middleware, and network device logs.  
Indicators of compromise (IOCs) summary 
TTPs 
 
Exploiting vulnerabilities [T1190] in widely used software including, but not limited 
to: 
 CVE-2021-40539—ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus. 
 https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa21-259a. 
 CVE-2021-27860—FatPipe WARP, IPVPN, MPVPN. 
 https://www.ic3.gov/Media/News/2021/211117-2.pdf. 
 
Using webshells for persistence and exfiltration [T1505.003], with at least some 
of the webshells derived from the Awen webshell. 
 
Using compromised Small-Office Home-Office (SOHO) devices (e.g. routers) to 
obfuscate the source of the activity [T1090.002]. 
 Most common types include ASUS, Cisco RV, Draytek Vigor, FatPipe 
IPVPN/MPVPN/WARP, Fortinet Fortigate, Netgear Prosafe, and Zyxel 
USG devices. 
 Common CVEs for these devices and mitigation guidance can be found in 
the joint Cybersecurity Advisory, “Top CVEs Actively Exploited by 
People’s Republic of China State-Sponsored Cyber Actors.” 
 
Using living off the land tools for discovery, lateral movement, and collection 
activities, to include: 
 certutil 
 dnscmd 
 ldifde 
 makecab

 wmic 
 xcopy 
 
Selective clearing of Windows Event Logs, system logs, and other technical 
artifacts to remove evidence of their intrusion activity [T1070]. 
 
Using open source “hacktools” tools, such as: 
 Fast Reverse Proxy (frp) 
 Probably derived from the publicly-available fatedier and 
EarthWorm variants. 
 Impacket 
 To detect Impacket usage, see the joint Cybersecurity Advisory: 
"Impacket and Exfiltration Tool Used to Steal Sensitive Information 
from Defense Industrial Base Organization”. 
 Mimikatz.exe  
 Remote administration tools 
 Defenders should consult the joint Cybersecurity Advisory: 
"Protecting Against Malicious Use of Remote Monitoring and 
Management Software". 
Command execution 
File names and directory paths used in these commands are only meant to serve as 
examples. Actual names and paths may differ depending on environment and activity, 
so defenders should account for variants when performing queries.  
Note: Many of the commands are derivatives of common system administration 
commands that could generate false positives when used alone without additional 
indicators.
