Warning of North Korean cyber threats  
targeting the Defense Sector 
 
Summary 
The Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz (BfV) of the Federal Republic of Germany and 
the National Intelligence Service (NIS) of the Republic of Korea (ROK) are issuing a 
second Joint Cyber Security Advisory (CSA) to raise awareness of cyber campaigns 
highly likely carried out by cyber actors of North Korea against the defense sector 
targeting companies and research centers.  
The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) puts high emphasis on military 
strength and focuses on the theft of advanced defense technologies from targets 
around the world. The BfV and NIS assess that the regime is using the military 
technologies to modernize and improve the performance of conventional weapons 
and to develop new strategic weapon systems including ballistic missiles, 
reconnaissance satellites and submarines. DPRK increasingly uses cyber espionage as 
a cost-effective means to obtain military technologies.  
This Joint CSA details DPRK’s tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) and Indicators 
of Compromise (IoCs) as well as it introduces two representative cases of intrusions

into facilities of the defense sector.  
The BfV and NIS attribute hacking incidents, described in this Joint CSA, individually 
to LAZARUS and another allegedly North Korean Cyber threat group. Though the main 
tradecraft of the first cyber actor is known to be spear phishing attacks against 
diplomatic and security experts, it recently appears to expand its targets to the 
defense and financial sectors. The LAZARUS group is a notorious and sophisticated 
cyber actor that has raised international attention for its involvement in a wide range 
of cyber attacks. LAZARUS is known for its advanced capabilities and involvement in 
high-profile incidents, including financial heists, ransomware campaigns, and cyber 
espionage. Successful cyber attacks in the defense sector may pave the way for DPRK 
to strengthening its military by obtaining sensitive and confidential data from across 
the globe. 
Since the cyber actors frequently change their infrastructure and constantly attack 
entities worldwide, the BfV and the NIS anticipate a similar trajectory in the future. 
This Joint CSA is published with the means to strengthen the defense industry in 
particular but also to inform other industry sectors as well as the public. 
 
Technical Details 
In the following section two representative cases for systematic attacks against the 
defense sector will be outlined. Based on the TTPs used in attacks, the first case is a 
malicious campaign against a defense research center, and the second describes 
LAZARUS’ procedure of using social-engineering to attack defense companies.

① Intrusion into a defense research center through a website maintenance 
& repair company 
The DPRK recently prioritized strengthening its naval power. Therefor it constructed 
a new submarine in Sept. 2023. Before that, end of 2022, a North Korean cyber actor 
intruded systems of a research center for maritime and shipping technologies. The 
cyber actor executed a supply-chain attack, initially infiltrating a supplier for 
maintaining one of the research center’s webservers to subsequently compromise the 
primary target. 
The cyber actor further infiltrated the research facility by deploying remote-control 
malware through a patch management system (PMS) of the research center, and stole 
various account information of business portals and email contents. The authoring 
agencies used MITRE ATT&CK1 to describe the attack flow. 
 
                                                                 
1 MITRE ATT&CK is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based of real-world 
observations.

Attack Flow 
1. The cyber actor breached a company for maintaining webservers of its target and 
stole SSH access credentials. Then the actor remotely accessed the webserver 
(Linux) of the research center (T1133). 
2. The actor used legitimate tools including curl, to download additional malicious 
files from C2 servers such as a tunnelling tool for remote access (Ngrok) and a 
Base64-encoded Python script functioning as a downloader. 
3. For lateral movement, the cyber actor established an SSH connection to other 
servers related to the website; collected packets by running tcpdump at the 
servers; obtained additional information about the network; and stole account 
credentials of the target’s employees (T1040, T1046, T1021). 
4. The cyber actor then used the account information of a security manager and 
gained access to the email account in order to obtain information regarding an 
operating procedure of the PMS. The actor impersonated the security manager 
and sent an email to the PMS service provider requesting to create a patch file 
with malicious functions. Though the file with malicious code masqueraded as a 
legitimate file, the genuine security manager detected and successfully blocked 
the attempt to distribute the malicious patch file through PMS. The malicious 
code had functions to upload and download files, execute code, and to collect 
system information etc (T1041, T1001, T1071).

5. Even after the research center strengthened the security, the cyber actor 
continued malicious attempts by exploiting a file-upload vulnerability of the 
website and uploading a web shell as well as sending spear phishing emails.

Key findings 
Rather than a direct compromise of a target system, the cyber actor first conducted 
attacks against one of the research center’s vendors. As it became difficult during the 
COVID pandemic to have onsite maintenance & repair services for server 
infrastructure, remote services were provided instead. However, lacking security 
measures allowed unattended access to servers without access control. 
Usually the cyber actor stops its activity, when detected. However, in this case, even 
after PMS distribution and SSH remote access were blocked, the cyber actor made 
various attempts to maintain persistence, by uploading a web shell to the web page 
and sending spear phishing emails to the target’s employees. 
Furthermore, the actor avoided carrying out a direct attack against its target, which 
maintained a high level of security, but rather made an initial attack against its vendor, 
the maintenance & repair company. This indicates that the actor took advantage of 
the trustful relationship between the two entities. 
Please refer to the Article 26 (Security of Service Providers) of the Basic Guidelines for 
National Intelligence Security of the Republic of Korea for details about 
recommendations for Korean national and public organizations receiving remote 
maintenance and repair services from vendors. German national and public 
organizations can refer to the guidelines OPS.2.1 and OPS.1.2.5 provided by the 
Federal Office for Information Security (BSI).

② North Korea’s Social Engineering Attacks  
In this second case the LAZARUS group’s distinctive skills in social engineering will be 
outlined. Since at least mid-2020 the DPRK took advantage of this attack vector to 
infiltrate defense companies. Due to the fact that in all observed cases the targeted 
employees of the companies received malicious files obfuscated in relation to job 
offers, the campaign soon was referred to as “Operation Dream Job”. Meanwhile for 
more than three years LAZARUS conducted this kind of attack against the defense 
sector and has proven to be an elusive and well-organized actor that poses a 
hazardous threat to not only cyber- but global security. 
 
Attack Flow 
In connection with cyber attacks, social engineering is a non-technical method 
that leverages human trust, curiosity, fear, or urgency to achieve malevolent 
goals. Over time it substantiated as a highly effective way to exploit human 
psychology and manipulating individuals into taking actions that could lead to 
Figure 2 - Overview of social engineering attack flow

security compromises. The pervading tendency of social engineering attacks 
could emanate from the fact, that the security measures security operation 
centers (SOCs) nowadays apply, present an almost impregnable barrier for 
cyber actors. Although the LAZARUS group’s technical tactics changed, the social 
engineering strategy remained the same. 
1. As the first step for being able to use social engineering the actor creates a profile 
on an online job portal. The profiles observed so far have been either a stolen 
profile of an existing person or a profile created with fake data. In both cases the 
profile is designated to look like a headhunter’s profile with a wide spread 
network of contacts to people working in the defense sector. Once the profile 
looks legit the actor continues with the next step. 
2. The actor searches for possible targets by looking at the profiles of people working 
for one of the companies of interest. Among these people the actor is looking for 
those who might have access to valuable assets like internal systems. 
3. Once the actor found an employee suitable as a target, it might add contacts of 
the target’s social circle to gain trust and reliability. Afterwards a connection to 
the employee is established via the job portal’s messaging service. The 
conversation with the target is initiated and in most cases held in English. The 
business small talk with the employee could last from days to weeks or even 
months and is supposed to establish trust. During this time the target is offered a 
job. Even if the targeted employee is not interested the attacker takes the time to 
persuade the employee, for example by highlighting the generous salary of the 
 
 
9 
 
 
 
offered position. Pretending to start a discrete recruitment process the target is 
asked to shift the communication to another channel (i.e. WhatsApp, Telegram, 
Skype, Discord or other). 
4. If the actor has successfully lured the targeted employee to another 
communication channel, the actor evolved different approaches to circumvent 
security measures of the target’s employing company. 
a. The actor sends a pdf file with a lucrative job offer tailored to the interests of 
the targeted employee and a pdf reader which contains disguised malware. 
b. The actor sends a file with superficial information about the position. 
Successively if the employee wants to know further details the attacker sends 
a link to a file with in-depth information on the position to the corporate email 
address and makes sure the employee is at work at the time the link is 
provided. The linked file is stored on a cloud-based service and contains the 
first stage of malware. 
c. More recently the job offers have been directed to programmers where the 
actor sends zip files containing an iso image with a coding challenge which has 
to be solved as part of the recruitment process. As soon as the programmer 
executes the challenge, the machine gets infected with the first stage 
malware. 
d. Another way the LAZARUS group attempts to get access to the company’s 
network is by sending a malicious vpn client in a zip file. 
 
 
10 
 
 
 
Key findings 
Universally the circumstance that employees usually do not talk to their colleagues or 
employer about job offers, plays into the hands of the attacker. The LAZARUS group 
changed its tools throughout the campaign and demonstrated more than once that it 
is capable of developing whatever is necessary to suit the situation.  
 
Mitigation 
Following prevention guidelines in the Joint CSA are based on the observations made 
by the BfV and NIS.  
Brief your employees on a regular basis about the latest tendencies in cyber attacks. 
This may deepen their understanding of cyber actors’ modus operandi which 
constantly evolves and ensure employees’ proper management when an actual 
intrusion happens. 
Since most of the attacks by North Korea´s cyber units are carried out through social 
engineering and supply-chain attacks, the following precautions shall be taken as 
applicable. 
 
Precautions against indirect attacks through a vendor 
• Limit access only to necessary systems when receiving remote maintenance and 
repair services, and authentication shall be performed before user permissions 
and privileges are granted. 
• Store and maintain audit logs including system access records, and monitor them 
 
 
11 
 
 
 
on a regular basis to detect an anomalous access. 
• Adopt a proper PMS procedure in order to verify user authentication, and 
implement an adequate verification and confirmation process for the final stage 
of distribution, as it can be easily targeted by malicious cyber actors for supply 
chain attacks. 
• Always implement SSL/TLS when creating a website in order to prevent breaches 
of critical data including account information, even in a situation where logs are 
captured by a cyber actor. 
• In case employees are using a VPN to work from home, a multi-factor 
authentication along with user ID and password authentication is highly 
recommended. In this case it is required to protect critical information including 
one time password (OTP) authentication keys from disclosure to a third party. 
• Please refer to section “Mitigations” of the first BfV-NIS Joint CSA published in 
March 2023 for details about spear phishing prevention guidelines. 
 
Social Engineering Attacks: Prevention and Best Practices 
• The best preventive measure to avoid social engineering attacks starts by 
educating personnel about some of the common social engineering tactics. This 
includes vigilance against suspicious password-locked doc files or links and 
establishing an error culture in which employees are encouraged to report 
security incidents without fearing consequences for being a victim of social 
engineering attacks. 
 
 
12 
 
 
 
• Another key element to mitigate the risk of social engineering attacks is limiting 
privileges and access to sensitive data only to authorized users.  
• In order to remove vulnerabilities in network systems a strict update and patch 
routine should be established. 
• These prevention guidelines are recommended to be applied to all domestic and 
overseas branches of your organization, including those which may be seen as 
distant from the mainstream.
