Insikt Group® researchers used proprietary Recorded Future Network Traffic 
Analysis and RAT controller detections, along with common analytical techniques, to 
identify and profile a cyberespionage campaign attributed to a suspected Chinese 
state-sponsored threat activity group, which we are tracking as RedDelta.
Data sources include the Recorded Future® Platform, Farsight Security’s 
DNSDB, SecurityTrails, VirusTotal, Shodan, BinaryEdge, and common OSINT 
techniques. 
This report will be of greatest interest to network defenders of private sector, 
public sector, and non-governmental organizations with a presence in Asia, as well 
as those interested in Chinese geopolitics.
Executive Summary
From early May 2020, The Vatican and the Catholic Diocese of 
Hong Kong were among several Catholic Church-related organizations 
that were targeted by RedDelta, a Chinese-state sponsored threat 
activity group tracked by Insikt Group. This series of suspected network 
intrusions also targeted the Hong Kong Study Mission to China and the 
Pontifical Institute for Foreign Missions (PIME), Italy. These organizations 
have not been publicly reported as targets of Chinese threat activity 
groups prior to this campaign.
These network intrusions occured ahead of the anticipated 
September 2020 renewal of the landmark 2018 China-Vatican provisional 
agreement, a deal which reportedly resulted in the Chinese Communist 
Party (CCP) gaining more control and oversight over the country’s 
historically persecuted “underground” Catholic community. In addition 
to the Holy See itself, another likely target of the campaign includes 
the current head of the Hong Kong Study Mission to China, whose 
predecessor was considered to have played a vital role in the 2018 
agreement.
The suspected intrusion into the Vatican would offer RedDelta 
insight into the negotiating position of the Holy See ahead of the deal’s 
September 2020 renewal. The targeting of the Hong Kong Study Mission 
and its Catholic Diocese could also provide a valuable intelligence source 
for both monitoring the diocese’s relations with the Vatican and its 
position on Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement amidst widespread 
protests and the recent sweeping Hong Kong national security law.
While there is considerable overlap between the observed TTPs of 
RedDelta and the threat activity group publicly referred to as Mustang 
Panda (also known as BRONZE PRESIDENT and HoneyMyte), there are 
a few notable distinctions which lead us to designate this activity as 
RedDelta:
The version of PlugX used by RedDelta in this campaign uses 
a different C2 traffic encryption method and has a different 
configuration encryption mechanism than traditional PlugX.
The malware infection chain employed in this campaign has not been 
publicly reported as used by Mustang Panda.
In addition to the targeting of entities related to the Catholic Church, 
Insikt Group also identified RedDelta targeting law enforcement and 
government entities in India and a government organization in Indonesia.
Key Judgments
The targeting of entities related to the Catholic church is likely 
indicative of CCP objectives in consolidating control over the 
“underground” Catholic church, “sinicizing religions” in China, and 
diminishing the perceived influence of the Vatican within China’s 
Catholic community.
Due to RedDelta’s targeting of organizations that heavily align to 
Chinese strategic interests, use of shared tooling traditionally used 
by China-based groups, and overlaps with a suspected Chinese 
state-sponsored threat activity group, Insikt Group believes that 
the group likely operates on behalf of the People’s Republic of 
China (PRC) government.
The identified RedDelta intrusions feature infrastructure, tooling, 
and victimology overlap with the threat activity group publicly 
reported as Mustang Panda (also known as BRONZE PRESIDENT 
and HoneyMyte). This includes the use of overlapping network 
infrastructure and similar victimology previously attributed to this 
group in public reporting, as well as using malware typically used 
by Mustang Panda, such as PlugX, Poison Ivy, and Cobalt Strike.

Threat Analysis
Overview of Catholic Church Intrusions
Using Recorded Future RAT controller detections and network traffic analysis 
techniques, Insikt Group identified multiple PlugX C2 servers communicating with 
Vatican hosts from mid-May until at least July 21, 2020. Concurrently, we identified 
Poison Ivy and Cobalt Strike Beacon C2 infrastructure also communicating with 
Vatican hosts, a Vatican-themed phishing lure delivering PlugX, and the targeting 
of other entities associated with the Catholic Church. 
The lure document shown above, which has been previously reported on in 
relation to links to Hong Kong Catholic Church targeting, was used to deliver a 
customized PlugX payload that communicated with the C2 domain systeminfor[.]
com. The document purported to be an official Vatican letter addressed to the 
current head of the Hong Kong Study Mission to China. It is currently unclear 
whether the actors created the document themselves, or whether it is a legitimate 
document they were able to obtain and weaponize. Given that the letter was 
directly addressed to this individual, it is likely that he was the target of a 
spearphishing attempt. Additionally, as this sample was compiled after signs of 
an intrusion within the Vatican network, it is also possible that the phishing lure 
was sent through a compromised Vatican account. This hypothesis is supported by 
the identification of communications between PlugX C2s and a Vatican mail server 
in the days surrounding the sample’s compilation date and its first submission to 
public malware repositories.
Background
China and the Catholic Church
For many years, Chinese state-sponsored groups have targeted religious 
minorities within the the PRC, particularly those within the so-called “Five 
Poisons,” such as Tibetan, Falun Gong, and Uighur muslim communities. Insikt 
Group has publicly reported on aspects of this activity, such as our findings on 
RedAlpha, the ext4 backdoor, and Scanbox watering hole campaigns targeting the 
Central Tibetan Administration, other Tibetan entities, and the Turkistan Islamic 
Party. Most recently, a July 2020 U.S. indictment identified the targeting of emails 
belonging to Chinese Christian religious figures — a Xi’an-based pastor, as well as 
an underground church pastor in Chengdu, the latter of whom was later arrested 
by the PRC government, by two contractors allegedly operating on behalf of the 
Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS). Regional branches of China’s Ministry 
of Public Security (MPS) have also been heavily involved in digital surveillance of 
ethnic and religious minorities within the PRC, most notably by the Xinjiang Public 
Security Bureau (XPSB) in the case of Uighur muslims.
Historically, the PRC has had a highly turbulent relationship with the Vatican 
and its governing body, the Holy See. In particular, the Holy See’s recognition 
of bishops within China’s historically persecuted “underground” Catholic church 
traditionally loyal to the Vatican and its relationship with Taiwan has maintained 
an absence of official relations since the 1950s. The CCP perceived this behavior 
as the Holy See interfering in religious matters within China. In September 2018, 
the PRC and the Holy See reached a landmark two-year provisional agreement, 
marking a significant step towards renewed diplomatic relations. 
Under the provisional agreement, China would regain more control over 
underground churches, and the Vatican in turn would gain increased influence 
over the appointment of bishops within the state-backed “official” Catholic church. 
The deal was met with a mixed reaction, with critics arguing that the deal was 
a betrayal of the underground church and would lead to increased persecution 
of its members. Many of the harshest criticisms came from clergy within Hong 
Kong. A year after the agreement, numerous reports noted the Vatican’s silence in 
response to the Hong Kong protests beginning in late 2019, in what critics called 
an effort to avoid offending Beijing and jeopardizing the 2018 agreement.

The head of the Hong Kong Study Mission is considered the Pope’s de facto 
representative to China and a key link between Beijing and the Vatican. The 
predecessor to this role played a key part in the finalization of the 2018 provisional 
China-Vatican agreement, making his successor a valuable target for intelligence 
gathering ahead of the deal’s expiry and likely renewal in September 2020. 
Further entities associated with the Catholic Church were also targeted by 
RedDelta in June and July 2020 using PlugX, including the mail servers of an 
international missionary center based in Italy and the Catholic Diocese of Hong 
Kong.
Insikt Group identified two additional phishing lures loading the same 
customized PlugX variant, which both communicated with the same C2 
infrastructure as the Vatican lure. The first sample included a lure document 
spoofing a news bulletin from the Union of Catholic Asian News regarding the 
impending introduction of the new Hong Kong national security law. The content 
of the lure file, titled “About China’s plan for Hong Kong security law.doc,” was 
taken from a legitimate Union of Catholic Asian News article. The other sample also 
references the Vatican using a document titled “QUM, IL VATICANO DELL’ISLAM.
doc” for the decoy document. This particular decoy document translates as “Qum, 
the Vatican of Islam,” referring to the Iranian city of Qum (Qom), an important 
Shi’ite political and religious center. It is taken from the writings of Franco Ometto, 
a Italian Catholic academic living in Iran. Although the direct target of these two 
lures are unclear, both relate to the Catholic church.
We believe that this targeting is indicative of both China’s objective in 
consolidating increased control over the underground Catholic Church within 
China, and diminishing the perceived influence of the Vatican on Chinese Catholics. 
Similarly, a focus on Hong Kong Catholics amid pro-democracy protests and the 
recent sweeping national security law is in line with Chinese strategic interests, 
particularly given the Anti-Beijing stance of many of its members, including former 
Hong Kong Bishop Cardinal Joseph Zen Ze-kiun.
Other Targeted Organizations
Insikt Group identified several additional suspected victims communicating 
with RedDelta C2 infrastructure. While metadata alone does not confirm a 
compromise, the high volume and repeated communications from hosts within 
targeted organizations to these C2s are sufficient to indicate a suspected 
intrusion. A full list of identified targeted organizations are summarized below:

lure document (right).

The organizations targeted by RedDelta in this campaign largely align 
with historical activity publicly reported on the threat activity group Mustang 
Panda, with the group previously linked to intrusion attempts targeting the Police 
of the Sindh Province in Pakistan, law enforcement organizations in India, and 
the targeting of entities within Myanmar, Hong Kong, and Ethiopia. The group is 
also suspected to have previously targeted China Center (China Zentrum e.V), 
a non-profit organization whose members includes Catholic aid organizations, 
religious orders and dioceses in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and Italy, and other 
organizations associated with religious and minority groups. 
Infrastructure Analysis
In this campaign, RedDelta favored three primary IP hosting providers, and 
used multiple C2 servers within the same /24 CIDR ranges across intrusions. 
Preferred hosting providers included 2EZ Network Inc (Canada), Hong Kong 
Wen Jing Network Limited, and Hong Kong Ai Jia Su Network Limited. The group 
consistently registered domains through GoDaddy, with WHOIS data providing 
additional linkages between domains used by the threat activity group. Insikt 
Group identified two primary clusters of RedDelta infrastructure used throughout 
this campaign, referred to as the “PlugX cluster” and the “Poison Ivy and Cobalt 
Strike cluster.” A Maltego chart is included below displaying these clusters.

‘Ma Ge Bei Luo Xiang Gang Jiu Dian’ and the PlugX 
Cluster
Vatican hosts and several other victim organizations were communicating 
with the PlugX C2 167.88.180[.]5 from May until June 10, 2020. This IP hosted the 
domain cabsecnow[.]com over this time period. Cabsecnow[.]com then resolved to 
a new IP, 103.85.24[.]136, from June 10 onwards. The suspicious network activity 
continued after the C2 IP was updated, increasing our confidence in the likelihood 
of intrusion at the targeted organizations.
The cabsecnow[.]com domain shares a similar naming convention to a publicly 
reported domain linked to Mustang Panda, cab-sec[.]com. WHOIS data revealed 
that both domains were registered several seconds apart through GoDaddy on 
September 17, 2019, with the same registrant organization listed: “Ma Ge Bei Luo 
Xiang Gang Jiu Dian.” This registrant organization is associated with eight domains 
in total, five of which have previously been publicly linked to Mustang Panda 
activity by Anomali and Dell SecureWorks. “Ma Ge Bei Luo Xiang Gang Jiu Dian” 
translates from Mandarin to Marco Polo Hotel Hong Kong, a legitimate Hong Kong 
hotel, although it is unclear why the actor chose this organization when registering 
these domains.
Another PlugX C2, 85.209.43[.]21, was also identified communicating with 
several hosts within the same targeted organizations (see Table 1). This IP has 
hosted ipsoftwarelabs[.]com since November 2019, a domain previously identified 
as a Mustang Panda PlugX C2. 
Finally, the C2 domain associated with the Vatican and Union of Catholic 
Asian News lures, systeminfor[.]com, was hosted on 167.88.180[.]32 since June 
2020. This IP has also hosted lameers[.]com since February 2020, another PlugX 
C2 identified in activity targeting Hong Kong.

a public malware repository from Italy in early June 2020, several days after the 
first evidence of activity between Vatican hosts and this C2, was configured to 
communicate with a spoofed Microsoft domain, web.miscrosaft[.]com, hosted 
on 154.213.21[.]207. Suspicious network traffic between this Poison Ivy C2 and 
several Vatican hosts, as well as an Indian aviation entity, were observed by Insikt 
Group analysts.
Two other IP addresses within the same 24-bit CIDR range, 154.213.21[.]73 
and 154.213.21[.]70, were also identified communicating with overlapping 
Vatican infrastructure at this time. A Cobalt Strike sample (SHA256:

This cluster of activity does not overlap with the infrastructure identified 
in the PlugX cluster. The WHOIS registration data for the domains miscrosaft[.]
com and hostareas[.]com contains the registrant organization “sec.” While less 
distinct than the “Ma Ge Bei Luo Xiang Gang Jiu Dian’’ registrant identified earlier 
in the PlugX cluster, there are still relatively few domains associated with this 
organization, and fewer still that were registered through GoDaddy. Using these 
characteristics, we identified that the domains svrhosts[.]com, strust[.]club, and 
svchosts[.]com all match this criteria and are previously reported Mustang Panda 
Cobalt Strike C2 domains. In particular, svrhosts[.]com and svchosts[.]com were 
both registered at the same time as hostareas[.]com on February 3, 2019 through 
GoDaddy.
Malware Analysis
While there is notable targeting and infrastructure overlap between this 
RedDelta campaign and publicly reported Mustang Panda activity, there are some 
deviations in tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used in both. For instance, 
Mustang Panda has typically used Windows Shortcut (LNK) files containing an 
embedded HTA (HTML Application) file with a VBScript or PowerShell script to load 
PlugX and Cobalt Strike Beacon payloads. However, in this campaign, RedDelta 
used ZIP files containing legitimate executables masquerading as lure documents, 
a notable departure from Mustang Panda activity that has been publicly reported 
previously. This legitimate executable is used to load a malicious DLL also 
present within the ZIP file through DLL sideloading, before the target is shown 
a decoy document. While Mustang Panda have used DLL sideloading previously, 
the PlugX variant used in association with this campaign has key differences 
from more traditional PlugX variants, particularly in the C2 protocol used and 
the configuration encoding within the samples, leading us to refer to it as the 
“RedDelta PlugX” variant below — however, this is not intended to suggest that 
this variant is used exclusively by this group and is in reference to the first group 
we have seen using this variant.
Figure 7: Execution diagram of the malware associated with RedDelta PlugX.
RedDelta PlugX: ‘Hong Kong Security Law’ Lure
The first sample, titled “About China’s plan for Hong Kong security 
law.zip” 
(SHA256:86590f80b4e1608d0367a7943468304f7eb665c9195
c24996281b1a958bc1512), corresponds to the Union of Catholic Asian News lure 
delivering the RedDelta PlugX variant. Although Insikt Group does not have full 
visibility into this infection chain, the ZIP file is likely to have been delivered via a 
spearphishing email. The ZIP contains two files:

Stage 1: Wwlib.dll DLL Sideload and Hk.dat Download 
and Execution
“About China’s plan for Hong Kong security law.exe” is a legitimate Windows 
loader for Microsoft Word that is vulnerable to sideloading.  When executed, it 
sideloads the malicious DLL, “wwlib.dll.”
Wwlib.dll initializes the loading stage by downloading, decoding, and executing 
an XOR-encoded Windows executable file, hk.dat, from http://167.88.180[.]198/
hk.dat. Next, wwlib.dll will extract a Word document, “About China’s plan for Hong 
Kong security law.docx” from its resource section and open it to make it appear to 
the user that a legitimate Microsoft Word document was opened.
Stage 2: Hk.exe/AAM Updates.exe DLL Sideloading to 
Load PlugX Variant
After “hk.dat” is decoded and executed, it will create three files in the 
C:\%APPDATA%/local/temp directory:
•	 Hk.exe (SHA256: 0459e62c5444896d5be404c559c834ba455fa5cae1689c
70fc8c61bc15468681) - A legitimate Adobe executable that is vulnerable 
to DLL sideloading

•	 Hex.dll (SHA256: bc6c2fda18f8ee36930b469f6500e28096eb6795e5fd17c
44273c67bc9fa6a6d) -  The malicious DLL sideloaded by hk.exe that 
decodes and loads adobeupdate.dat
•	 Adobeupdate.dat (SHA256: 01c1fd0e5b8b7bbed62bc8a6f7c9ceff1725d4ff
6ee86fa813bf6e70b079812f) - The RedDelta PlugX variant loader
Next, “hk.exe” is executed and creates copies of the files “adobeupdate.dat,” 
“hex.dll,” and itself renamed as “AAM Updates.exe” in the folder “C:\ProgramData\
AAM UpdatesIIw.” “AAM Updates.exe” is then executed, starting the installation 
process by sideloading the malicious “hex.dll.” “Hex.dll” will decode and execute 
“adobeupdate.dat,” which ultimately leads to the execution of the RedDelta PlugX 
variant in memory. This use of DLL sideloading, including the use of this specific 
Adobe executable, aligns with recent public reporting of Mustang Panda PlugX 
use (1, 2).
RedDelta PlugX: ‘Qum, the Vatican of Islam’ Lure 
The second PlugX sample uses the same loading method identified above. In 
this case, the same WINWORD.exe executable is used to load another malicious 
wwlib.dll file. The sample then contacts http://103.85.24[.]190/qum.dat to retrieve 
the XOR-encoded Windows executable file, qum.dat. This sample uses the same 
C2 as above, www.systeminfor[.]com.
RedDelta PlugX: Vatican Lure Targeting Hong Kong 
Study Mission
The final PlugX sample featuring the Vatican Hong Kong Study Mission 
lure also uses largely the same PlugX loading method. In this case, the ZIP file 
contains a benign Adobe Reader executable, AcroRd32.exe, renamed “DOC-
2020-05-15T092742.441.exe,” which is used to load the malicious acrord32.dll 
file through DLL sideloading. In this case the sample retrieves the file dis.dat from 
http://167.88.180[.]198/dis.dat and uses the same C2 referenced in the previous 
samples.
RedDelta PlugX: Installation Process
Insikt Group performed detailed analysis on the DAT files related to the “Union 
of Catholic Asian News” and “Qum, the Vatican of Islam” lure. Analysis of these 
samples showed two DAT files were downloaded from the URLs listed in the table 
below:
In each case, the file (“hk.dat” or “qum.dat“) is downloaded and executed after 
initial execution of the phishing lure, as described above in “Stage 1: Wwlib.dll DLL 
Sideload and Hk.dat Download and Execution.” Both files are RtlCompress/LZNT1 
compressed, as well as XOR-encoded. The XOR key precedes the encoded data, 
allowing the file to be more easily decoded during static analysis. A Python script 
to decompress and decode the payload can be found on our GitHub repository.
After the DAT files are decompressed and decoded, they are executed. The 
execution details for “hk.dat” have been detailed above (see: “Stage 2:  Hk.exe/AAM

Updates.exe DLL Sideloading to Load PlugX Variant“) and are nearly identical to 
that of “qum.dat.” As with the hk.dat sample associated with the “Union of Catholic 
Asian News” lure, the main purpose of this stage of the malware is to perform the 
DLL sideloading step in order to execute the PlugX variant.
Again, the final stage consists of three files: a non-malicious executable, a 
malicious sideloaded DLL, and the encoded DAT file which are all used to sideload 
the final payload. This is consistent with a typical PlugX installation. 
Like the first-stage DAT files, the PlugX loaderDAT file is XOR-encoded and 
the decode key precedes the encoded data in the file; however, they are not 
RtlCompress/LZNT1 compressed as the initial stage files are. A Python script to 
decode the PlugX loader, as well as the configuration block, is contained on our 
GitHub repository.
RedDelta: An Updated PlugX Variant
The PlugX variant used in the RedDelta campaign is similar to the PlugX 
variants previously associated with Mustang Panda by Avira and Anomali. Both 
make heavy use of stack strings as an obfuscation mechanism, as seen in Figure 
8, making it harder for an analyst to use strings to determine the functionality or 
purpose of the code.

Figure 8: Comparison of Anomali/Avira PlugX variant stack string implementation and RedDelta stack 
string implementation.
However, the configuration block for the RedDelta PlugX variant has one 
key distinction: the Avira-reported Mustang Panda configuration block decoding 
function looks for the string “XXXXXXXX” to determine whether the configuration 
is encoded, while the RedDelta variant looks for the string “########.” Apart from 
the different demarcator strings, both variants use the same rolling XOR encoding 
with the key “123456789.”  The configuration block decode routine can be seen 
in Figure 9, below.

A Python implementation of this algorithm can be observed in Figure 10, 
below.
Figure 10: Python implementation of RedDelta PlugX configuration block decoding mechanism.
In conventional PlugX samples, the configuration block is encrypted with a 
more complex algorithm using multiple keys in combination with shift left and shift 
right bitwise operations. For example, the Python code implementing this algorithm, 
as seen in Figure 11, was created by Kyle Creyts based on Takahiro Haruyama’s 
extensive research and analysis on PlugX. 
Figure 11: Python implementation of traditional PlugX configuration block decoding mechanism by 
Kyle Creyts.
The configuration block encryption associated with the RedDelta variant is 
considerably less sophisticated when compared to traditional PlugX samples, and 
while both make use of XOR-based ciphers, the simple algorithm used by RedDelta 
would be easier to brute force by an analyst.

Command and Control Protocol 
The C2 protocol used for the RedDelta PlugX malware differs from the Mustang 
Panda PlugX. While both variants use the HTTP POST method common to PlugX 
including the number of “61456” in the POST header field which is a clear indicator 
of a PlugX HTTP POST. However, the RedDelta variant does not include the URI 
string  “/update?wd=” more commonly associated with PlugX, as seen in Figure 12.
Figure 12: HTTP POST request from Anomali/Avira PlugX variant and RedDelta PlugX variant.
The RedDelta PlugX variant encrypts its C2 communications very differently 
when compared to the Mustang Panda variant reported by Anomali and Avira. 
Instead of using XOR encoding, RedDelta uses RC4 encryption where the first 
10 bytes of the passcode are hardcoded and the last four bytes are randomly 
generated and included as a key within the TCP packet so that the communication 
can be decrypted. The hardcoded portion of the RC4 passphrase is “!n&U*O%Pb$.” 
Figure 13 shows the function where the RC4 passphrase is defined as well as 
where the last four bytes are appended to create the full key. A Python script to 
decode the RedDelta C2 communication from a supplied PCAP can be found on 
our GitHub repository. 
Despite the different C2 encryption schemes, both RedDelta and Mustang 
Panda variants’ C2 traffic decrypts to the familiar PlugX header format, as shown 
in Figure 14.
Figure 14: PlugX header and data.
In conventional PlugX samples, the C2 uses the same algorithm as in the 
configuration decode (see Figure 11), with part of the key being the first four bytes 
of the TCP transmission. While the RedDelta PlugX variant also uses the first four 
bytes of the TCP transmission as a part of the key, the use of RC4 for C2 encryption 
demonstrates a departure from the usual PlugX C2 traffic encryption mechanism.

RC4 key used in RedDelta PlugX variant.

While Recorded Future has not done extensive code analysis to further 
compare the samples, we have highlighted fundamental differences between the 
RedDelta PlugX variants and conventional PlugX, notably in the configuration block 
and C2 communication. Additionally, while RedDelta has implemented a modular 
delivery system based on traditional PlugX tactics, it also provides the group with 
the ability to change, enhance or remove functionality as needed.
Cobalt Strike
The file, OneDrive.exe, is responsible for loading the Cobalt Strike payload. 
When executed, OneDrive will reach out to http://154.213.21[.]27/DotNetLoader40.
exe, download the file DotNetLoader40.exe and invoke the “RunRemoteCode” 
function contained within it.
DotNetLoader40.exe is a small .NET executable that essentially downloads and 
then executes shellcode. The main function in DotNetLoader is “RunRemoteCode” 
which takes a URL as an argument. The content is downloaded from the provided 
URL, in this case, http://154.213.21[.]27/beacon.txt, and then sent to the function 
“InjectShellCode.” The shellcode is then base64 decoded, decompressed, saved 
to memory, and executed. 
The shellcode loaded is Cobalt Strike Beacon, which is configured using the 
Havex Malleable C2 profile. This Havex C2 code has been published on GitHub 
and can be used by any entity that wishes to use it; and in this case, the attacker 
is doing so in conjunction with Cobalt Strike. This can be seen both through the 
URI used within the C2 URL (http://154.213.21[.]70/wp08/wp-includes/dtcla.php) 
and the client and server headers and HTML content displayed below in Figure 15.

Outlook
Our research uncovered a suspected China state-sponsored campaign 
targeting multiple high-profile entities associated with the Catholic Church ahead 
of the likely renewal of the provisional China-Vatican deal in September 2020. 
The CCP’s warming diplomatic relations with the Holy See has been commonly 
interpreted as a means to facilitate increased oversight and control over its 
unofficial Catholic church. This also supports the CCP’s wider stated goal of 
“sinicizing religions” in China. Furthermore, it demonstrates that China’s interest 
in control and surveillance of religious minorities is not confined to those within 
the “Five Poisons,” exemplified by the continued persecution and detainment of 
underground church members and allegations of physical surveillance of official 
Catholic and Protestant churches. 
The U.S. Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom recently 
expressed concern regarding the impact of the new national security law within 
Hong Kong, stating it has the “potential to significantly undermine religious 
freedom.” The targeting of the Catholic diocese of Hong Kong is likely a valuable 
intelligence source for both monitoring the diocese’s position on Hong Kong’s pro-
democracy movement and its relations with the Vatican. This marks a possible 
precursor to increased limits on religious freedom within the special administrative 
region, particularly where it coincides with pro-democracy or anti-Beijing positions.
RedDelta is a highly active threat activity group targeting entities relevant 
to Chinese strategic interests. Despite the group’s consistent use of well-known 
tools such as PlugX and Cobalt Strike, infrastructure reuse, and operations security 
failures, these intrusions indicate RedDelta is still being tasked to satisfy intelligence 
requirements. In particular, this campaign demonstrates a clear objective to target 
religious bodies, and therefore we feel this is particularly pertinent for religious 
and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to take note and invest in network 
defenses to counter the threat posed by Chinese state-sponsored threat activity 
groups like RedDelta. A lack of ability to invest in security and detection measures 
for many NGOs and religious organizations greatly increases the likelihood of 
success for well-resourced and persistent groups, even using well-documented 
tools, TTPs, and infrastructure.
Network Defense Recommendations
Recorded Future recommends that users conduct the following measures to 
detect and mitigate activity associated with RedDelta activity: 
•	 Configure your intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention 
systems (IPS), or any network defense mechanisms in place to alert on — 
and upon review, consider blocking illicit connection attempts from — the 
external IP addresses and domains listed in the appendix.
Additionally, we advise organizations to follow the following general 
information security best practice guidelines:
•	 Keep all software and applications up to date; in particular, operating 
systems, antivirus software, and core system utilities.
•	 Filter email correspondence and scrutinize attachments for malware.
•	 Make regular backups of your system and store the backups offline, 
preferably offsite so that data cannot be accessed via the network.
•	 Have a well-thought-out incident response and communications plan. 
•	 Adhere to strict compartmentalization of company-sensitive data. In 
particular, look at which data anyone with access to an employee account 
or device would have access to (for example, through device or account 
takeover via phishing).
•	 Strongly consider instituting role-based access, limiting company-wide 
data access, and restricting access to sensitive data.
•	 Employ host-based controls; one of the best defenses and warning signals 
to thwart attacks is to conduct client-based host logging and intrusion 
detection capabilities. 
•	 Implement basic incident response and detection deployments and 
controls like network IDS, netflow collection, host logging, and web proxy, 
alongside human monitoring of detection sources. 
•	 Be aware of partner or supply chain security standards. Being able to 
monitor and enforce security standards for ecosystem partners is an 
important part of any organization’s security posture.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS | CHINA
 Recorded Future’s research group, Insikt, tracks threat actors 
and their activity, focusing on state actors from China, Iran, Russia, 
and North Korea, as well as cyber criminals - individuals and groups 
- from Russia, CIS states, China, Iran, and Brazil. We emphasize 
tracking activity  groups and where possible, attributing them to 
nation state government, organizations, or affiliate institutions.
 
Our coverage includes:
•	
Government organizations and intelligence agencies, 
their associated laboratories, partners, industry 
collaborators, proxy entities, and individual threat 
actors.
•	
Recorded Future-identified, suspected nation state 
activity groups, such as RedAlpha, RedBravo, Red Delta, 
and BlueAlpha and many other industry established 
groups.
•	
Cybercriminal individuals and groups established and 
named by Recorded Future
•	
Newly emerging malware, as well as prolific,persistent 
commodity malware
 
Insikt Group names a new threat activity group or campaign 
when analysts have data corresponding to at least three points 
on the Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis with at least medium 
confidence, derived from our Security Intelligence Graph. We can tie 
this to a threat actor only when we can point to a handle, persona, 
person, or organization responsible. We will write about the activity 
as a campaign in the absence of this level of adversary data. We 
use the most widely-utilized or recognized name for a particular 
group when the public body of empirical evidence is clear the activity 
corresponds to a known group.
Insikt Group utilizes a simple color and phonetic alphabet 
naming convention for new nation state threat actor groups or 
campaigns. The color corresponds to that nation’s flag colors, 
currently represented below, with more color/nation pairings to 
be added as we identify and attribute new threat actor groups 
associated with new nations.
For newly identified cybercriminal groups, Insikt Group uses a 
naming convention corresponding to the Greek alphabet. Where we 
have identified a criminal entity connected to a particular country, 
we will use the appropriate country color, and where that group may 
be tied to a specific government organization, tie it to that entity 
specifically.
Insikt Group uses mathematical terms when naming newly 
identified malware.
