Chinese Threat Actor Used Modified Cobalt Strike Variant to
Attack Taiwanese Critical Infrastructure
Arda Büyükkaya
–
June 2, 2023
Executive Summary
EclecticIQ researchers identified a malicious web server very likely operated by a Chinese threat actor
used to target Taiwanese government entities, including critical infrastructure.
The command-and-control infrastructure was publicly exposed to the internet. Based on log and meta
data found on the server, EclecticIQ analysts assess with high confidence the threat actor performed
offensive cyber operations, including reconnaissance, malware delivery, and post-exploitation against
selected targets.
EclecticIQ analysts identified a modified version of Cobalt Strike known as "Cobalt Strike Cat"[1].
Researchers analyzed these logs and created a detailed map of the adversary's tactics, techniques, and
procedures (TTPs).
The threat actor primarily focused on exploiting four different remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities
to target web services and heavily relied on open-source tools, some of which are exclusively available in
Chinese underground forums. The threat actor also engaged in brute-forcing against the victim's internal
web services.

Exposed Threat Actor Infrastructure Reveals Offensive Tooling 
EclecticIQ analysts discovered a web server with the IP address 156[.]251[.]172[.]194, which was
accessible to the public. The server contained HTTP header data (SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python/3.8.10),
indicating the use of a Python library called SIMPLEHTTPSERVER to serve the files and folders detailed
in Figure 1.

showing available tools and target lists..
EclecticIQ analysts identified post-exploitation and reconnaissance tools on the server. Most of the tools
are open source. Based on the event logs within a modified version of Cobalt Strike, analysts have
determined with high confidence that Mandarin was set as the default language. The identified tools
include:
Afrog:
Vulnerability Scanning for Penetration Testing [2]
CIPR:
Converting domain name to IP address [3]
Neo-reGeorg:
Reverse proxy tool [4]
Nuclei:
Vulnerability scanner [5]
OneForAl:
Subdomain collection tool [6]

Fscan:
Reconnaissance tool [7]
LaZagne:
Recover stored passwords on a system [8]
SharpCheckInfo:
Situation awareness tool [9]
HackBrowserData: Decrypting and exporting browser data [10]
FRP:
Reverse proxy tool [11]
ONE-FOX:
Collection of Penetration Tools [12]
Targeted Attack Lifecycle  
The Targeted Attack Lifecycle is a methodology to map adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures
(TTPs) in a structed way. EclecticIQ analysts mapped identified TTPs to each phase of the life cycle
(Figure 2) - beginning with the threat actor´s infrastructure (156[.]251[.]172[.]194) and continuing with the
different tools used by the actor to compromise systems and perform lateral movement.
Figure 2 – Targeted Attack Lifecycle of the threat actor. 
Reconnaissance of Exposed Webservices 
The threat actor utilized reconnaissance tools to scan and fingerprint systems exposed to the internet. In
some cases, the actor used a preconfigured (hard-coded) target lists, which is showing the intended
victims. EclecticIQ analysts validated many of these targets as real and existing systems. Figure 3 shows
an example of a target list created by the attacker, which mainly contains Taiwanese government entities.
This list served as input for OneForAll - a subdomain enumeration tool.

Figure 3 – Files inside the exposed infrastructure 

under the OneForAll file path.
 

After enumerating subdomains of the associated victim network, the threat actor uses automated
vulnerability scanning tools including Nuclei and Afrog to identify potentially exploitable systems. Figure 4
shows final report logs from Afrog and Nuclei found on the attacker infrastructure.
The threat actor utilized virtual sandboxes named "Test" to demonstrate cyber-attacks before executing
them on a real victim device. The IP addresses observed in these virtual sandboxes are tied to the same
computer name, identified as DESKTOP-0TBCAC4. The adversary also demonstrated an interest in
exploring the public-facing network surface of public transport and utilities industries.

Initial Compromise Through Exploiting Publicly Facing
Applications
The threat actor utilized automated vulnerability discovery and reconnaissance techniques to scan a
given target list, refine the selection and identify potential exploitable systems before commencing the
attack. Based on evidence obtained from the bash history data, EclecticIQ researchers observed that the
threat actor primarily focuses on four different known remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities during
their operations:
•    CVE-2023-21839      Oracle WebLogic Server RCE [13]

•    CVE-2021-3129      Laravel debug mode RCE [14]

•    CVE-2020-2551      Oracle WebLogic RCE [15]

•    CVE-2021-44228     Apache Log4j [16]
  
Figure 5 – BASH history logs of from the threat actor’s 

system showing exploitation of CVE-2020-2551. 

Establish Foothold by Modified Version of Cobalt Strike
The threat actor utilized a modified version of Cobalt Strike 4.5, dubbed "Cobalt Strike Cat", to create a
dedicated communication channel from the victim system and perform evasive post-exploitation steps.
Cobalt Strike Cat was initially shared on a Chinese-speaking cybersecurity forum called t00ls[.]com, with
a link to a GitHub repository and was distributed inside an encrypted ZIP folder. Only registered users of
t00ls[.]com could obtain the decryption key for the ZIP folder and access the tool. Notably, t00ls[.]com is a
private forum that can only be accessed by individuals who possess invitation codes for the site.

Figure 7 – Example user interface of Cobalt Strike Cat 

shared on a GitHub repository. 
Notable features of Cobalt Strike Cat include: 
1.    Evasion techniques to specially bypass Anti-Virus solution “360 Total Security”, which is a Beijing,
China-registered internet security company mostly used in Asia-Pacific region.

2.    Option to use Google 2FA key during login to the command-and-control server as an attacker for
further operational security. 

3.    Modified stager designed to evade signature-based detection during malware execution.

4.    Patch for publicly available Cobalt Strike vulnerability tracked as CVE-2022-39197 [17].
7/19
Figure 8 shows a small portion of Cobalt Strike Cat logs from the attacker´s infrastructure. According to
log data, a reverse shell was established from the remote victim device as SYSTEM-level privileges using
a process named "bea.exe". The attacker then changed the Cobalt Strike Cat beaconing frequency for
behaviour-based evasion by sending the "sleep 10" command to the infected host and executed the
"tasklist /SVC" command to list all running processes on the victim device.
  
Figure 8 – Sample of Cobalt Strike Cat logs.
 

The result of the "tasklist" command shows that the victim was using a commercial software called
SONAS [18]. SONAS is an application for remote monitoring and control of Internet of Things (IoT)
hardware devices. Analysts assess with high confidence that the compromised device was used to
access CCTV cameras of the Directorate General of Highways in Taiwan.
Analysis showed that the victim IP address was publicly serving a web service that contained a
phpMyAdmin database. The database used a weak password and was susceptible to brute-force
attacks. 
Figure 9 shows the redacted victim DNS address, confirming that the web service was used by the
Taiwanese government. The IP addresses and the computer name matched the victim device name in
the Cobalt Strike Cat logs.

Internal Reconnaissance to Identify Lateral Movement
Opportunities 
EclecticIQ researchers observed multiple internal network reconnaissance attempts after initial
compromise. These attempts are primarily performed with an open-source automated vulnerability
scanning and brute forcing tool called FSCAN.
Figure 10 showed that the threat actor used FSCAN (named as f.exe) to find possible vulnerabilities on
internal network of infected device which can be used by threat actor to perform lateral movement:
 
9/19
Figure 10 – Usage of FSCAN on a victim’s network.
  

EclecticIQ researchers observed that the threat actor used the Windows command-line arguments to
perform general reconnaissance against infected devices. The following commands were identified: 

Command Line Argument
Description
query user || qwinsta
Display information about logged-on users and their
sessions.
net user
Displays information about user accounts.
findstr /s /i "DBPath" *.*
Used to search for the string "DBPath" in all files within
the current directory and its subdirectories.
arp –a
Address resolutions for remote systems.
netsh wlan show profiles
Display a list of all the wireless network profiles.
dir
%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Recent
List of recently opened files and folders on the
computer.
10/19
Figure 11 shows some examples of commands executed by the threat actor on an infected host:
Figure 11 – Executed reconnaissance commands on infected host.
Escalate Privileges with Stolen Credentials 
The threat actor uses stolen passwords from valid accounts as the primary vector for privilege escalation.
The actor deployed various credential stealing techniques against compromised hosts to obtain user
account passwords in NTLM hash format and saved credentials from web browser. These passwords
would allow the threat actor to escalate privileges using valid accounts if the accounts were privileged .
The Cobalt Strike Cat beacon logs (Figure 12) show that the actor uploaded LaZagne onto the infected
device for credential harvesting purposes and deleted the LaZagne binary after execution to avoid
detection from the user's side.
EclecticIQ researchers observed LaZagne uploaded from the attacker device
(“C:\Users\Test\Desktop\ONE-FOX集成工具箱_V1.0魔改版_by狐狸
\gui_other\Cobalt_Strike_4.5\plugin\TaoWu\script\lazagne.exe”)  to the victim device file path
C:\Windows\Temp. The actor leveraged ONE-FOX - a collection of pentest tools - to copy binaries from
actor´s system to the victim.  

 
11/19
Figure 12 – Threat actor successfully obtained 

user account credentials in NTLM format. 
The threat actor utilized an open-source tool called HackBrowserData to export victim browser data,
including passwords, history, cookies, bookmarks and download records from several web browsers.  
Figure 13 – Execution of Hack-browser-data on infected host. 
Maintain Presence via Windows Service Installation
To establish persistent remote access on the victim device, the threat actor abused Windows services to
install modified version of Cobalt Strike payload. Windows services ran with the highest privilege, NT
AUTHORITY\SYSTEM and execute the malware automatically during system startup, allowing for remote
access to the victim device with persistence.
12/19
Malicious service installation is accomplished via the below command line argument:
sc create WindowsUpdate binPath= C:\Windows\Temp\svchost.exe start= auto obj= LocalSystem
DisplayName= windowsupdate
When this command is executed on remote victim device, it will install a fake Windows service called
“windowsupdate”.This service executes a malicious binary (Cobalt Strike Cat payload) under
“C:\Windows\Temp\svchost.exe” every time the victim device is started.
Figure 14 – Installation of malicious Windows service.
Move Laterally Trough Reverse Proxy
The threat actor utilized open-source reverse proxy tools to expose local devices located behind a NAT or
firewall, to the Internet. This allowed the attacker to conduct vulnerability scans, general reconnaissance,
and brute-force attacks on systems attached to the internal network of the infected device.
Threat actor uploaded the fast reverse proxy (FRP) binary to the "C:\Windows\Temp" file path and then
executed it on victim machine. Figure 15 displays the reverse SOCKS proxy activity on the infected
device using the open-source tool FRP.
FRP received a command-line argument from attacker used to establish a connection from the
adversary-controlled infrastructure (156[.]251[.]172[.]194) over port 2333.
13/19
Figure 15 – Execution of FRP reverse SOCKS proxy on infected host.
After establishing the reverse SOCKS proxy connection, the threat actor performed internal
reconnaissance and brute forcing attempts on some of the internal FTP servers inside victim network.
Victimology and Targeting Patterns
EclecticIQ researchers assess with moderate confidence that the primary targets of the threat actor are
Taiwanese government entities and organizations in the critical infrastructures sector. Logs obtained from
attacker infrastructure, such as target lists and metadata show that organizations in Taiwan account for
the largest proportion of targets.
According to event logs, on 02/09 at 08:51:43 UTC, EclecticIQ researchers have concluded with high
confidence that the actor compromised an IOT device in the network of the Directorate General of
Highways, MOTC in Taiwan [19]. After this initial comprise the threat actor performed reconnaissance
and credential harvesting from infected host, very likely to perform lateral movement as an end goal.
Although the majority of activity was directed at Taiwanese government entities, researchers also
observed other separate target lists containing IP addresses and domains associated to government
websites from Egypt, Malaysia, Dominican Republic and the UAE also targeted recently by this threat
actor.
14/19
Figure 16 – Reconnaissance against Malaysian 

and Egyptian government entities.
The reconnaissance against Malaysian and Egyptian government entities was carried out using a generic
Python script that contained an author comment section with the handle "mwxiaojia." However, there is
no distinct evidence to conclusively attribute the cyber operations to an individual using that persona.
Attribution
EclecticIQ analysts assess with moderate confidence that the infrastructure was operated by a Chinese
threat actor. Analysts identified the following findings supporting the assessment:
1. The modified version of Cobalt Strike event logs obtained from the threat actor infrastructure
revealed additional IP addresses that very likely belong to the attacker and metadata that very
likely show the origin of the attacker.
2. File and folder names, file content and comments in threat actor tools were written in Mandarin.
3. The timezone of attacker virtual sandbox 103[.]156[.]184[.]83 is in the UTC+08:00 timezone. This
time zone is used in all predominantly Chinese-speaking regions.
4. Every successful login attempt made by the attacker using the default Cobalt Strike username 'neo'
to access the command-and-control server was logged, along with the attacker's IP address.
EclecticIQ researchers observed that the threat actor used private proxy addresses from a Chinese
underground proxy IP solution called 'Tigercloud Club' to conceal their real IP address.
5. Some of tools used by the actor are exclusively available in Chinese underground forums.
6. The identified adversary TTPs overlap with a previously known Chinese APT group called
Budworm [20].

Mitigation and Prevention Strategies
16/19
One of the main initial access vector is exploitation of publicly exposed web services. EclecticIQ
researchers recommend limiting the remote access of publicly available web services and consistently
monitoring and installing available patches. 
Reconnaissance attempts on publicly exposed web services can be detected and stopped     using a
combination of techniques, such as:
•    Log analysis: Monitoring and analyzing logs generated by the web server can help identify abnormal
traffic patterns, such as repeated attempts to access a specific resource or an unusually high volume of
requests from a single IP address.

•    Network traffic analysis: Network traffic analysis can help identify traffic that is not legitimate or is
attempting to scan the network or web services.

•    Intrusion detection systems: Deploying an intrusion detection system (IDS) can help identify and alert
administrators to malicious activities such as port scans or network sweeps.

•    Web application firewalls: Web application firewalls (WAF) can be used to protect web services from
reconnaissance attempts by blocking or limiting access to resources and detecting and blocking known
malicious patterns in web traffic.
The threat actor used a variation of Cobalt Strike as a command and control (C2) server to send
malicious commands into infected computers. Some tips to help prevent such C2 connection attempts:
•    Monitor network traffic: Monitor network traffic regularly to detect unusual activities or traffic patterns
that may indicate C&C connections.

•    Deploy firewalls: Deploy firewalls to block traffic from known C&C domains or IP addresses.
The threat actor installed a second stage persistence backdoor on infected device by abusing Windows
Services. The actor then tried to dump User Account credentials via SAM database and attempted to
access saved browser credentials. There are several ways to use Windows Group Policy to avoid these
kinds of post exploitation attempts:
•    Disable the "Create global objects" user right: This user right allows non-administrative users to create
global objects, including services. By disabling this user right, you can prevent non-administrative users
from creating services.

•    Restrict access to the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) file: The SAM file contains sensitive
information, including user account passwords. By default, only the SYSTEM account has access to the
SAM file. However, an attacker who gains administrative access to the system can potentially dump the
SAM file and extract password hashes. Restrict access to the SAM file, you can use the "Deny access to
this computer from the network" user right. By denying network access to the system, you can prevent
attackers from using network-based attacks to dump the SAM file.

•    Disable password saving in web browser using Group Policy.
