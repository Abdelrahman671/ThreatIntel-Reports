APT Attack Attempts Disguised as North Korea Related
Paper Requirements (Kimsuky)
⋮ 2/22/2022
The ASEC analysis team has recently discovered the distribution of malicious Word (DOC) files to
graduate school professors that are disguised as North Korea-related paper requirements. The name of
the Word file is shown below. The term ‘KIMA’ mentioned in the filename is the name of the monthly
magazine specializing in the field of security, national defense, and military, published by Korea Institute
for Military Affairs.
March Monthly KIMA Paper_Requirements.doc
The attacker performed spear-phishing attacks targeting professors of certain universities. Figure 1
shows the macro feature and overall operation method of the malicious word file: downloading additional
commands (Visual Basic Script) and executing them from memory.

Figure 1. Word file’s attack flow
The way the executed VBS code communicates with the attacker’s C&C server is similar to the method
introduced in the previous ASEC blog post (APT Attacks Using Malicious Word File of a Particular
Thesis).

The VBS code downloaded from the attacker server obtained during the time of the analysis collects and
leaks the following information from the user PC.

Basic system information (computer name, owner information, producer, computer model, and
system type)
OS information (OS, OS version, and memory capacity)
Processor information
Anti-malware software information
Information of currently running processes
Information of file list within certain folders (path of desktop, My Folder, Favorites, Recent,
ProgramFiles, and Downloads)

Names of recently opened word files
The script also creates a VBS file named “OfficeAppManifest_[minute]_[hour]_[day]_[month].ini” in the
path of “%AppData%\Microsoft\Templates“. It then registers a service disguised as that of Microsoft to
run the script. This is thought to maintain the persistence of running the script. The registered service
waits for the commands from the attacker server in a method similar to that of the word macro feature
initially run.

“OfficeAppManifest_v[minute]_[hour]_[day]_[month].ini” // Minute, hour, day, and month refer
to the time when the downloaded script was initially run
The document-type APT attack method is a type that has been found the most often from AhnLab’s ASD
(AhnLab Smart Defense) infrastructure last year.
AhnLab’s anti-malware programs detect and block the malware using the alias below.
