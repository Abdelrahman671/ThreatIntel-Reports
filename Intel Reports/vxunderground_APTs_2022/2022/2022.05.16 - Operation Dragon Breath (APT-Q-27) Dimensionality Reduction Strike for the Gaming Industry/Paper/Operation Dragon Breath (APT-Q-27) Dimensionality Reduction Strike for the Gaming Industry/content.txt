Operation Dragon Breath (APT-Q-27): Dimensionality
Reduction Strike for the Gaming Industry
This article starts with the new activities of Golden Eye Dog, and at the end of the article will disclose the
Miuuti Group organization where the Golden Eye Dog gang is located.
Overview
Since 2015, Qi'anxin Threat Intelligence Center has been maintaining high-intensity tracking of the
gambling and fraud industries in East Asia, Southeast Asia and other regions. In 2020, we released the
"Ukiyo-e of Southeast Asian Gaming Industry, Doing All the Black Industries and Practices" [1] made a
general analysis of the background and environment of the gaming industry, and subsequently disclosed
the gaming and ﬁnancial industries such as Golden Eye Dog [2] , Golden Diamond Dog [1] , Golden
Finger Dog [3] , etc. Targeted attack activities. The purpose of these gangs is very simple: to transfer
gambling funds to their own wallets through the method of "black eat black" to achieve ﬁnancial freedom.
With the normalization of the new crown epidemic, more and more gamblers prefer online gambling, but
online gambling is mixed, and the threshold for platform construction is low. Induce gamblers to log on to
the platform to play, and then cheat gambling money, so-called online gambling, ten bets and nine loses.
We conservatively estimate that there are currently nearly 10,000 gaming sites targeting East Asian
gamblers, involving hundreds of billions of gambling capital. In such a lucrative environment, it is bound to
attract the attention of many hacker gangs. At present, most "gaming companies" will conduct security
education and training for employees to prevent hacker gangs from entering the company's intranet by
phishing social workers.
After years of confrontation between the oﬀensive and defensive sides, several high-level hacker gangs
have gradually emerged. From 2015 to the present, Qi Anxin Threat Intelligence Center has captured
several RCE 0day attacks against the gaming industry. A foreign businessman, avast , has captured the
attack against gaming companies that exploited the wps 0day vulnerability in the recently released
Longbao operation article [4] . This incident shows that the level of attacks against the gaming industry is
no less than that of the current mainstream APT gangs. However, the number of gaming-related global
security reports every year is very small and has not been taken seriously by friends and businessmen.
Golden Eye Dog (Qianxin Internal Tracking Number APT-Q-27) is a hacker gang targeting people
engaged in gambling, dog push and overseas Chinese groups in Southeast Asia. Its business scope
covers remote control, mining, DDOS and traﬃc related. The samples are mainly disseminated in
Telegram groups, and the samples have a good eﬀect of avoiding killing. Some baits are highly targeted
and very tempting.
In this article, we still start with the new activities of Golden Eyed Dog. At the end of the article, we will
disclose the Miuuti Group organization where the Golden Eyed Dog gang is located.
New activity in the watering hole
Since we published "Golden Eye Dog Organization Watering Hole Campaign: Targeted Attacks on
Telegram Users" [5] in late 2020 , the gang has changed the process of executing malicious code triggers
to be more stealthy and harder to detect.

ITW
Telegram
Chinese
version.msi

/Telegram_install.zip
A registry entry has been added to the Registry of the custom msi structure to store subsequent
payloads.
The execution ﬂow of desktop shortcuts has been modiﬁed in the Shortcut structure.
Once installed, the malicious registry entry is as follows:
Msi does not immediately execute malicious code during installation. When the victim's dual-computer
shortcut starts Telegram, it will enter the malicious code execution process. The export function
cYreenQillm of dllt0.dll is called through TGlaunch.exe. The Lnk ﬁle structure is as follows:
It is worth mentioning that TGlaunch has a digital signature and is a normal module of a product.
The function is relatively simple, the export function of the dll is called, and the attacker uses it as a
natural loader and uses it, and the white and black of another dimension are added.
dllt0.dll with aspack shell, the main function is still a Loader.
Launch a legitimate telegram program, which will then read the payload from the registry key and decrypt
it for execution.
The payload loaded in memory is the Ghost modiﬁcation commonly used by the Golden Eyed Dog gang.
CC= 156.255.211.27:1445, the PDB of the same source code on VT is also consistent with the 2020
event.
The installation package of the overseas chat software potato was also found on the Shuideng website.
The execution process is the same as the above, so it will not be repeated here.
Based on C2, we observed that the gang was testing an injector written in Delphi:

Based on the watering hole domain name, we observed that the gang used the Telegram Chinese
language package as a bait to deliver the Trojan:

Dropper with the same function is written in Golang and C++ respectively.
Release the following programs in the download directory, a2a is a 7zip program with a digital signature.
Start the shortcut and call a2a.exe to decompress b.zip.
The decompressed content is a white and black package, and template.txt is the encrypted stored
payload.
Some interesting strings were observed:
Read Chrome's metamask extension, an open-source Ethereum wallet, where the attacker wants to
obtain the wallet address on the victim machine.
In 2022, we discovered the latest attack activity of the gang. The diﬀerence is that msi with digital
signature does not need to pop up a UAC request during the installation process, and the option to start
telegram is added after the installation is complete.
The Lnk ﬁle is as follows:
Start the white and black suite, zcrashreport.dll has a vmp shell and a digital signature, after
deobfuscation is as follows:
The main function is to load the built-in DLL in memory and call the export function,

Delphi backdoor has up to more than 100 control instructions. CC=156.245.12.43:6688
After analysis, we found that the delphi backdoor is a cross between the ancient gray pigeon backdoor
and XtremeRAT, adding dozens of functions that meet the needs of modern attacks, some of which
impressed us.
Miuuti Group
During the two-year watering hole activity, the gang used mainstream languages such as .net, c++,
golang, and delphi to develop malware. The overall level of immunity from killing was high, reﬂecting high
tactical literacy. After dimensional analysis, we believe that there is a larger and higher-level group above
the Golden Eye Dog. This group has a large number of personnel and high liquidity. At present, there is
no real evidence to prove the relationship with other organizations. , so we temporarily call it Miuuti
Group.
We have a moderate level of conﬁdence that the Miuuti Group was associated with multiple zero-day
attacks on messaging software during 2015-2017.
Summarize
At present, the full line of products based on the threat intelligence data of Qi'anxin Threat Intelligence
Center, including Qi'anxin Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP), Tianqing, Tianyan Advanced Threat
Detection System, Qi'anxin NGSOC, Qi'anxin Situational Awareness, etc., have already supported this
Accurate detection of class attacks.
