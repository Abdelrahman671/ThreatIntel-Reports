Why does APT41 matter to healthcare?
•
APT41 targets healthcare 
•
Targets medical device companies and 
pharmaceuticals for intellectual property theft
•
Often looking for clinical trial data and research as 
well as corporate intelligence
“APT41 activity aimed at medical device 
companies and pharmaceuticals is demonstrative 
of the group's capacity to collect sensitive and 
highly valuable intellectual property (IP)” – FireEye
•
Examples:
•
July 2014 through May 2016 - APT41 targeted the medical device subsidiary of a large healthcare 
industry corporation
•
May 2015 - A biotech company being acquired was targeted by APT41
•
Sensitive corporate information about operations, human resources, tax information and other 
acquisition-related data was targeted
•
2018, APT41 targeted a third healthcare company, with unknown intentions
•
2018, a cancer research organization was spearphished by APT41; this was followed up by a 
malware attack against the same organization in 2019

Attribution and linkages
•
FireEye’s analysis:
•
Assessed with “high confidence” that APT41 is attributable to Chinese individuals working on behalf of 
the Chinese government
•
These individuals are also conducting financially motivated cyber operations for themselves
•
Activities associated with:
•
BARIUM – Associated with Chinese government; supply-chain attacks against technology companies
•
Winnti – Associated with Chinese government; history of use of Winnti malware against gaming 
industry; Also shared with other Chinese espionage operators including APT17, APT20 and APT41
•
Previously known as GREF
•
Heavy code overlap and weapon-usage overlap with APT17
•
China-attributed APT targeting US defense, IT, mining, and legal targets
•
Appears to have shared access to source code/developers (likely a high-pri/sophisticated group)
