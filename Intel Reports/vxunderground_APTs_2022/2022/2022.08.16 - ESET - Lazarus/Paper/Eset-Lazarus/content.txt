Malware is compiled for both Intel and Apple Silicon. It drops three files: a 
decoy PDF document Coinbase_online_careers_2022_07.pdf, a bundle 
FinderFontsUpdater.app  and a downloader safarifontagent. It is similar to 
#ESETresearch discovery in May. 2/7

#ESETresearch A year ago, a signed Mach-O executable disguised as a 
job description was uploaded to VirusTotal from Singapore 
. Malware 
is compiled for Intel and Apple Silicon and drops a PDF decoy. We think 
it was part of #Lazarus campaign for Mac. @pkalnai @marc_etienne_

However, this time the bundle is signed July 21 (according to the timestamp) 
using a certificate issued in February 2022 to a developer named Shankey 
Nohria and team identifier 264HFWQH63. The application is not notarized 
and Apple has revoked the certificate on August 12. 3/7

Another change is in the downloader, safarifontagent, as it connects to a 
different C&C server (https://concrecapital[.]com/%user%.jpg) The C&C 
server did not respond at the time we analyzed this threat. 4/7

The decoy pdf is "Engineering Manager, Product Security" job 
description at Coinbase.

Next stage: (gone!)
