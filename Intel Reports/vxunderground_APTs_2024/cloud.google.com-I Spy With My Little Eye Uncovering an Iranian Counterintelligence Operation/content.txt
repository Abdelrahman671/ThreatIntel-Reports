I Spy With My Little Eye: Uncovering an Iranian
Counterintelligence Operation
Mandiant ⋮ ⋮ 8/28/2024
Written by: Ofir Rozmann, Asli Koksal, Sarah Bock
Today Mandiant is releasing details of a suspected Iran-nexus counterintelligence operation aimed at
collecting data on Iranians and domestic threats who may be collaborating with intelligence and security
agencies abroad, particularly in Israel. 
The data collected by this campaign may support the Iranian intelligence apparatus in pinpointing
individuals who are interested in collaborating with Iran’s perceived adversarial countries. The collected
data may be leveraged to uncover human intelligence (HUMINT) operations conducted against Iran and
to persecute any Iranians suspected to be involved in these operations. These may include Iranian
dissidents, activists, human rights advocates, and Farsi speakers living in and outside Iran.
Mandiant assesses with high confidence this campaign was operated on behalf of Iran’s regime, based
on its tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), themes, and targeting. In addition, we observed a
weak overlap between this campaign and APT42, an Iran-nexus threat actor suspected to operate on
behalf of Iran’s IRGC Intelligence Organization (IRGC-IO). This campaign’s activities are in line with
Iran’s IRGC and APT42’s history of conducting surveillance operations against domestic threats and
individuals of interest to the Iranian government. Despite the possible APT42 connection, Mandiant
observed no relations between this activity and any U.S. elections-related targeting as previously
reported by Google's Threat Analysis Group.
The activity used multiple social media accounts to disseminate a network of over 35 fake recruiting
websites containing extensive Farsi decoy content, including job offers and Israel-related lures, such as
images of Israeli national symbols, hi-tech offices, and major city landmarks. Upon entry, the targeted
users are required to enter their personal details as well as their professional and academic experience,
which are subsequently sent to the attackers. 
The suspected counterintelligence operations started as early as 2017 and lasted at least until March
2024. In the past, similar campaigns were deployed in Arabic, targeting individuals affiliated with Syria
and Hezbollah intelligence and security agencies. This may indicate Iran’s counterintelligence activities
extend beyond its own security and intelligence apparatus, possibly in support of its allies in Syria and
Lebanon. 
Mandiant worked to help ensure this activity was blocked and disrupted, the threat actor’s accounts were
terminated, and Google Chrome users and the users of other browsers were protected.
Attack Lifecycle
2/13
This activity leverages a network of fake recruitment websites posing as Israel-based human resources
firms that use similar imagery in attempts to socially engineer Farsi-speaking individuals into providing
personal details. The websites were disseminated online including through fake social media accounts,
and used similar templates. The attack lifecycle is depicted in Figure 1.
Figure 1: Attack lifecycle
The activity consists of several stages.
Step 1: Disseminate Links to Fake Recruitment Websites
Mandiant identified multiple fake social media accounts promoting the websites on various social
platforms, such as X (formerly Twitter) and Virasty, commonly used in Iran. 
3/13
The following X post contains a link to the malicious website, topwor4u[.]com, as well as the following
description translated from Farsi:
“In the past year, we were able to attract hundreds of information and cyber professionals and achieve
unique successes at the global level.
If you have information and cyber work experience, join us”.

Figure 3: Post by @A_Soleimani_Far, a Virasty (Iranian social network) profile promoting the fake
recruitment website joinoptimahr[.]com
Step 2: Fake Job Offer Websites Presenting Israel-Related Decoy Content
Upon entering the website, the user is presented with the alleged purpose of the fake human resources
firms: “[to] recruit employees and officers of Iran’s intelligence and security organizations.” 
The fake recruitment websites share templates and content, posing as HR firms, like “Optima HR”
or “Kandovan HR.”
The websites contain an elaborate description written in Farsi, presenting the alleged human
resources firm as “active in the fields of international information and security/cyber consulting and
research worldwide”. 
The websites contain a Farsi description of the “Terms of Cooperation” with the fake HR firm:
“Having relevant documented experience and resume in the field of information and cyber in related
institutions and organizations (Mandatory).
Protecting your privacy is our priority.

Excellent salary for the chosen ones.
Our center invites you to contact us to submit a job offer and receive special and unique projects!!
 Join us to help each other impact the world.

Our duty is to protect your privacy.”
Mandiant observed both desktop and mobile versions of the websites beparas[.]com displaying
similar contents and lures affiliated with Israel, including Israel’s flag and major city landmarks.

Figure 5: Desktop and mobile versions of the website beparas[.]com used in February 2024; the left web
page also includes a form and a Telegram contact link
6/13
The websites contain Telegram contact links, using handles that contain “IL” (Israel) references,
further enhancing the perceived Israel-affiliation of the campaign. For example:
hxxps://t[.]me/PhantomIL13
hxxps://t[.]me/getDmIL 
Several fake recruitment websites also contained a link to join a Telegram chat:
hxxps://t[.]me/joinchat/AAAAAFgDeSXaWr2r_AQImw
Further inspection of the domain beparas[.]com indicated the WordPress user data for the website
is publicly available and lists the username “miladix” as well as Gravatar URLs likely affiliated with
this user (see the following screenshot). The value "b7e2f4a5bc67256189e6732fbce86520" in the
Gravatar URLs is the Sha256 value of the user’s email, according to Gravatar documentation.
The nickname "Miladix" might be related to “Milad Azadi,” the name of the X account used by the
campaign and previously mentioned. In addition, "Milad" is a Persian name, further strengthening
the campaign’s affiliation to Iran. 
Mandiant observed a domain miladix[.]com, affiliated with an Iranian software developer, although
no links were found tying the campaign to miladix[.]com or its operator.

Step 3: Targeted User Fills Out Form, Personal and Professional details Sent to
Attackers
The fake recruitment websites contain a form that includes the fields: name, birth date, email, home
address, education, and professional experience.

“Axis of Resistance”: Historic Operations Targeting Syria and
Hezbollah
Close inspection of the fake “Optima HR” websites revealed a previous network of fake recruitment
websites that targeted Farsi speakers as well as Arabic speakers affiliated with Syria and Lebanon
(Hezbollah) masquerading as a different HR firm named “VIP Human Solutions.”
The “VIP Human Solutions” sites used very similar imagery and themes, purporting to recruit for security-
and intelligence-related jobs using Israel-affiliated decoy content, as can be seen in the Figure 8.

Figure 9: dreamy-jobs[.]com, a fake “VIP Human Solutions” website used in 2022
The “VIP Human Solutions” website’s contents, template, and personal details form are almost identical
to the “Optima HR” website. The headline translates to:
“VIP job selection is a recruitment center for respected personnel and employees of Iran's security and
intelligence organizations and institutions.”
Mandiant observed significant overlaps between the historic “VIP Human Solutions” campaign and the
ongoing “Optima HR” campaign, and considers both to be deployed by the same threat actor. The activity
was mentioned publicly in the past and was suspected to be related to the Israeli Mossad.
Figure 10: A Tweet from January 2021 mentioning “VIP Human Solutions”
Mandiant observed the aforementioned Telegram group chat active, which has been active since at
least 2021 and used by the two clusters:
hxxps://t[.]me/joinchat/AAAAAFgDeSXaWr2r_AQImw
9/13
The same link was embedded in multiple “VIP Human Solutions” websites, occasionally along with
Israel (+972) phone numbers and additional Telegram accounts:
hxxps://t[.]me/DreamyJobs_com
hxxps://t[.]me/wazayif_IL

“wazayif” is the English transcription of the word “jobs” in Arabic (وظايف)
The “VIP Human Solutions” recruitment websites were likely in use from at least 2018 to at least 2023. In
addition to Farsi websites, the cluster used Arabic websites with similar templates.
Translation of the Arabic website’s title: 
“VIP Recruitment, a center for recruiting respected military personnel into the army, security services and
intelligence from Syria and Hezbollah, Lebanon.”

to target Syria and Hezbollah's intelligence personnel
Mandiant also observed another version of the same website in 2023, which includes the “Loren Ipsum”
dummy text in Arabic, possibly indicating that the updated version of the website was not operational yet.
The template includes the Syrian flag and map, an Israeli phone number (+972), and a Telegram contact
link: hxxps://t[.]me/DreamyJobs_com.

While the “VIP Human Solutions” domains were registered beginning in 2020, Mandiant observed further
historic evidence suggesting that the campaign has been active since at least 2018. 
Specifically, a YouTube channel named “VIP Human Solutions” was created by “Alireza Ebrahimpoor” in
November 2018. The channel contains a single video by “VIP Jobs Global,” with a Farsi description very
similar to the fake recruitment websites’, presented as a “recruitment center for retirees and employees of
Iran’s security and intelligence organizations and institutions”. The threat actor-controlled YouTube
channel is no longer available.
Figure 13: “VIP Human Solutions” YouTube channel: hxxps://www[.]youtube[.]com/@vipjobsglobal1819
The video has very similar content and theme as the fake recruitment websites, including the use of the
unique logo of “VIP Human Solutions.”

The video also contains the following contact details:
Email address: sendcv@vipjobsglobal[.]com. The domain vipjobsglobal[.]com was registered in
March 2018.
Facebook page: hxxps://facebook[.]com/358690841262928, which started operating in December
2017 and is no longer active.

Outlook and Implications
Mandiant estimates this activity supports Iranian counterintelligence efforts to identify individuals affiliated
(or interested in working) with intelligence and security agencies.
Specifically, the activities described in this blog post are of concern to Iranian individuals who are
suspected to be collaborating with countries Iran might perceive as adversaries. These may include
Iranian dissidents, activists, human rights advocates, and Farsi speakers living in and outside Iran.
The campaign casts a wide net by operating across multiple social media platforms to disseminate its
network of fake HR websites in an attempt to expose Farsi-speaking individuals who may be working with
intelligence and security agencies and are thus perceived as a threat to Iran’s regime. The collected data,
such as addresses, contact details, as well as professional and academic experience, might be leveraged
in future operations against the targeted individuals.
