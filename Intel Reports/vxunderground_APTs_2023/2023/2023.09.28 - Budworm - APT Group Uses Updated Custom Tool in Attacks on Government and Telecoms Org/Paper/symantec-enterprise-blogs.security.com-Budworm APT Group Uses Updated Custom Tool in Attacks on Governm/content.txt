Budworm: APT Group Uses Updated Custom Tool in Attacks
on Government and Telecoms Org
The Budworm advanced persistent threat (APT) group continues to actively develop its toolset. Most
recently, the Threat Hunter Team in Symantec, part of Broadcom, discovered Budworm using an updated
version of one of its key tools to target a Middle Eastern telecommunications organization and an Asian
government.
Both attacks occurred in August 2023. Budworm (aka LuckyMouse, Emissary Panda, APT27) deployed a
previously unseen variant of its SysUpdate backdoor (SysUpdate DLL inicore_v2.3.30.dll). SysUpdate is
exclusively used by Budworm. 
As well as its custom malware, Budworm also used a variety of living-off-the-land and publicly available
tools in these attacks. It appears the activity by the group may have been stopped early in the attack
chain as the only malicious activity seen on infected machines is credential harvesting.
Tools Used
Budworm executes SysUpdate on victim networks by DLL sideloading the payload using the legitimate
INISafeWebSSO application. This technique has been used by the group for some time, with reports of
INISafeWebSSO being leveraged dating as far back as 2018. DLL sideloading attacks use the DLL
search order mechanism in Windows to plant and then invoke a legitimate application that executes a
malicious payload. It can help attackers evade detection.
2/3
SysUpdate is a feature-rich backdoor that has multiple capabilities, including:
List, start, stop, and delete services
Take screenshots
Browse and terminate processes
Drive information retrieval
File management (finds, deletes, renames, uploads, downloads files, and browses a directory)
Command execution
Trend Micro reported in March 2023 that Budworm had developed a Linux version of SysUpdate with
similar capabilities to the Windows version. SysUpdate has been in use by Budworm since at least 2020,
and the attackers appear to continually develop the tool to improve its capabilities and avoid detection.
As well as SysUpdate, the attackers used a number of legitimate or publicly available tools to map the
network and dump credentials. Tools used by the attackers in this campaign included:
AdFind: A publicly available tool that is used to query Active Directory. It has legitimate uses but is
widely used by attackers to help map a network.
Curl: An open-source command-line tool for transferring data using various network protocols.
SecretsDump: A publicly available tool that can perform various techniques to dump secrets from
the remote machine without executing any agent. Techniques include reading SAM and LSA
secrets from registries, dumping NTLM hashes, plaintext credentials, and Kerberos keys, as well as
dumping the NTDS.dit Active Directory database.
PasswordDumper: A password-dumping tool.
Budworm Background
Budworm is a long-running APT group that is believed to have been active since at least 2013. The
attackers are known for their targeting of high-value victims, often focusing on organizations in the
government, technology, and defense sectors. Budworm has targeted victims in many countries in
Southeast Asia and the Middle East, among other locations, including the U.S. Symantec’s Threat Hunter
Team published a blog in October 2022 detailing how Budworm activity was seen on the network of a
U.S. state legislature. In that campaign, the attackers also targeted the government of a Middle Eastern
country, a multinational electronics manufacturer, and a hospital in Southeast Asia. The attackers also
leveraged DLL sideloading in that campaign to load their HyperBro malware.
The victims in this campaign — a government in Asia and a telecommunications company in the Middle
East — do align with the kinds of victims we often see Budworm targeting. The targeting of a
telecommunications company and government also point to the motivation behind the campaign being
intelligence gathering, which is the motivation that generally drives Budworm activity.
That Budworm continues to use a known malware (SysUpdate), alongside techniques it is known to
favor, such as DLL sideloading using an application it has used for this purpose before, indicate that the
group isn’t too concerned about having this activity associated with it if it is discovered. 
The use of a previously unseen version of the SysUpdate tool also demonstrates that the group is
continuing to actively develop its toolset. The fact that this activity occurred as recently as August 2023
3/3
suggests that the group is currently active, and that those organizations that may be of interest to
Budworm should be aware of this activity and the group’s current toolset.
