TTPs
9
• Scanning external websites of targets looking for vulnerabilities and unpatched software. APT 
groups leverage this type of attack to target healthcare entities. Password spray campaigns typically 
target single sign-on (SSO) and cloud-based applications utilizing federated authentication protocols. 
An actor may target this specific protocol because federated authentication can help mask malicious 
traffic. By targeting SSO applications, malicious actors hope to maximize access to intellectual 
property during a successful compromise.
• Targeting email applications. In those instances, malicious actors would have the ability to utilize 
inbox synchronization to (1) obtain unauthorized access to the organization's email directly from the 
cloud, (2) subsequently download user mail to locally stored email files, (3) identify the entire 
company’s email address list, and/or (4) surreptitiously implements inbox rules for the forwarding of 
sent and received messages.
• TTPs of password spraying include:
• Using social engineering tactics to perform online research (i.e., Google search, LinkedIn, etc.) to 
identify target organizations and specific user accounts for initial password spray.
• Using easy-to-guess passwords (e.g., “Winter2018”, “Password123!”) and publicly available tools, 
execute a password spray attack against targeted accounts by utilizing the identified SSO or web-
based application and federated authentication method
• Leveraging the initial group of compromised accounts, downloading the Global Address List (GAL) 
from a target’s email client, and performing a larger password spray against legitimate accounts
• Using the compromised access, attempting to expand laterally (e.g., via Remote Desktop Protocol) 
within the network, and performing mass data exfiltration using File Transfer Protocol tools such as 
FileZilla
Password Spraying1

TTPs
• A drive-by compromise is when an adversary gains access to a system through a user visiting 
a website over the normal course of browsing. With this technique, the user's web browser is 
typically targeted for exploitation, but adversaries may also use compromised websites for 
non-exploitation behavior such as acquiring application access tokens.
Drive-by Compromise1
• The use of software, data, or commands to take advantage of a weakness in an Internet-
facing computer system or program in order to cause unintended or unanticipated behavior. 
The weakness in the system can be a bug, a glitch, or a design vulnerability. These 
applications are often websites, but can include databases (like SQL), standard services (like 
SMB or SSH), and any other applications with Internet accessible open sockets, such as web 
servers and related services. Depending on the flaw being exploited this may include 
Exploitation for Defense Evasion.
Exploit Public-Facing Application2
• Remote services such as VPNs, Citrix, and other access mechanisms allow users to connect 
to internal enterprise network resources from external locations. There are often remote 
service gateways that manage connections and credential authentication for these services. 
Services such as Windows Remote Management can also be used externally.
External Remote Services3

TTPs
• Adversaries may introduce computer accessories, computers, or networking hardware into a system 
or network that can be used as a vector to gain access. While public references of usage by APT 
groups are scarce, many penetration testers leverage hardware additions for initial access. 
Commercial and open source products are leveraged with capabilities such as passive 
network tapping, man-in-the middle encryption breaking, keystroke injection, kernel memory reading 
via DMA, adding new wireless access to an existing network, and others.
Hardware Additions1
• Adversaries may move onto systems, possibly those on disconnected or air-gapped networks, by 
copying malware to removable media and taking advantage of Autorun features when the media is 
inserted into a system and executes. In the case of Lateral Movement, this may occur through 
modification of executable files stored on removable media or by copying malware and renaming it to 
look like a legitimate file to trick users into executing it on a separate system. In the case of Initial 
Access, this may occur through manual manipulation of the media, modification of systems used to 
initially format the media, or modification to the media's firmware itself.
Replication Through Removable Media2
• Spearphishing attachment is a specific variant of spearphishing. Spearphishing attachment is 
different from other forms of spearphishing in that it employs the use of malware attached to an 
email. All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered social engineering targeted at a specific 
individual, company, or industry. In this scenario, adversaries attach a file to the spearphishing email 
and usually rely upon User Execution to gain execution.

TTPs
• Spearphishing with a link is a specific variant of spearphishing. It is different from other forms 
of spearphishing in that it employs the use of links to download malware contained in email, instead 
of attaching malicious files to the email itself, to avoid defenses that may inspect email attachments.
Spearphishing Link1
• Spearphishing via service is a specific variant of spearphishing. It is different from other forms 
of spearphishing in that it employs the use of third party services rather than directly via enterprise 
email channels.
Spearphishing via Service2
• Supply chain compromise is the manipulation of products or product delivery mechanisms prior to 
receipt by a final consumer for the purpose of data or system compromise.
Supply Chain Compromise3
• Adversaries may breach or otherwise leverage organizations who have access to intended victims. 
Access through trusted third party relationship exploits an existing connection that may not be 
protected or receives less scrutiny than standard mechanisms of gaining access to a network.

Description
Emotet
(1) (2)
Trojan that is primarily spread through spam 
emails. The infection may arrive either via 
malicious script, macro-enabled document 
files, or malicious link and contain familiar 
branding designed to look like a legitimate 
email.
An advanced, modular trojan that primarily 
functions as a downloader or dropper of other 
trojans. Emotet continues to be among the most 
costly and destructive malware affecting state, 
local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) governments, 
and the private and public sectors.
TrickBot (1) (3)
Trojan developed in 2016 used to target 
Windows machines.
A modular trojan that targets sensitive 
information and acts as a dropper for other 
malware. Since June 2019, the MS-ISAC 
observed an increasingly close relationship 
between initial TrickBot infections and eventual 
Ryuk ransomware attacks.
Ryuk (1) (4)
Ransomware that uses encryption to block 
access to a system, device, or file until a 
ransom is paid.
A type of crypto-ransomware that uses 
encryption to block access to a system, device, 
or file until a ransom is paid. Ryuk is often 
dropped on a system by other malware, most 
notably TrickBot.

Description
MAZE (5)
Ransomware that not only uses encryption to 
block access to a system, device, or file until a 
ransom is paid but renames files and often 
releases some information as an incentive for 
payment.
Deploys ransomware post-compromise. This 
methodology provides an opportunity to infect 
more hosts within a victim’s environment and 
exfiltrate data, which is leveraged to apply 
additional pressure on organizations to pay 
extortion fees. Notably, in at least some cases, 
the actors behind these operations charge an 
additional fee, in addition to the decryption key, 
for the non-release of stolen data.
Gh0st Rat (6)
Trojan “Remote Access Tool” used on 
Windows platforms
A family of backdoors, or more accurately, 
remote administration tools (RATs), used to gain 
control of the computer it infects. It is affiliated 
with Ghostnet bot network, and steals 
information by logging keystrokes.

Security Operations &Threat 
Intelligence
• Set up a security monitoring 
capability so you are collecting the 
data that will be needed to analyze 
network intrusions. 
• Understand APT and associated 
cybercriminals tactics, techniques, 
and procedures (TTPs) to include, 
historical attacks and targeted 
vulnerabilities.
• Increase the identification and 
ingestion of APT and associated 
cybercriminal unit IOCs.
Patch Management
• Update VPNs, network 
infrastructure devices, and devices 
being used to remote into work 
environments with the latest 
software patches and 
configurations. See CISA’s 
guidance on enterprise VPN 
security and NCSC guidance on 
virtual private networks for more 
information.
• Keep systems updated with the 
most recent patches and prioritize 
patching for the most at-risk 
systems based on identified TTPs.

Assets
• Use modern systems 
and software. 
• If you cannot move off 
out-of-date platforms 
and applications, there 
are short-term steps 
you can take to improve 
your position. 
Architecture
• Protect the 
management interfaces 
of your critical 
operational systems. 
• In particular, use 
browse-down 
architecture to prevent 
attackers easily gaining 
privileged access to 
your most vital assets. 
Incident Response
• Have and practice an 
incident response plan.  
Identify which events 
are considered 
incidents and provide 
organizational structure, 
roles, and 
responsibilities for 
responding to these 
events. 
• Develop procedures for 
performing incident 
handling and reporting. 
Set guidelines for 
communicating with 
outside parties 
regarding incidents.

Passwords
• Review password policies to 
ensure they align with the 
latest NIST guidelines, and 
deter the use of easy-to-guess 
passwords.
• Review IT helpdesk password 
management related to initial 
passwords, password resets 
for user lockouts, and shared 
accounts. IT helpdesk 
password procedures may not 
align to company policy, 
creating an exploitable 
security gap.
• Regularly audit user 
passwords against common 
password lists, using free or 
commercial tools.
• Provide pragmatic advice to 
users on how to choose good 
passwords.
Authentication
• Enable multi-factor 
authentication (MFA), and 
review MFA settings to ensure 
coverage on externally-
reachable endpoints.
Training
• Understanding Cognitive Bias
• The Need for Controls
• Administrative
• Roles, Responsibilities, 
Functions
• Separation of Duties
• Physical and Process
• Physical protections
• Protective procedures
• Principle of Least Privilege
• Cyber Hygiene / Awareness
• Social Engineering
• Protective Procedures

Summary
•
APT groups steal data, disrupt operations, and destroy infrastructure. Unlike most cybercriminals, APT 
attackers pursue their objectives over  longer periods of time. They adapt to cyber defenses and frequently 
retarget the same victim.
•
Common HPH targets include:
•
Healthcare
Biotechnology
Medical devices
•
Pharmaceuticals
Healthcare information technology
•
Scientific research 
•
HPH organizations who have been victim of APT attacks have suffered:
•
Reputational harm 
Disruption to operations
•
Financial losses 
PII/PHI and proprietary data theft
•
HC3 recommends several mitigations and controls to counter APT threats.
