This report details recent activity conducted by the likely Chinese state-
sponsored threat activity group RedDelta. The activity was identified through a 
combination of large-scale automated network traffic analytics and expert analysis. 
This report will be of most interest to individuals and organizations with strategic 
and operational intelligence requirements relating to Chinese cyber threat activity, 
as well as network defenders in government organizations within Southeast Asia 
and Europe.
Executive Summary
Recorded Future’s Insikt Group continues to track activity we 
attribute to the likely Chinese state-sponsored threat activity 
group RedDelta targeting organizations within Europe and 
Southeast Asia using a customized variant of the PlugX backdoor. 
Since at least 2019, RedDelta has been consistently active within 
Southeast Asia, particularly in Myanmar and Vietnam, but has also 
routinely adapted its targeting in response to global geopolitical 
events. This is historically evident through the group’s targeting 
of the Vatican and other Catholic organizations in the lead-up to 
2021 talks between Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and Vatican 
officials [1,2], as well as throughout 2022 through the group’s 
shift towards increased targeting of European government and 
diplomatic entities following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
During the 3-month period from September through 
November 2022, RedDelta has regularly used an infection 
chain employing malicious shortcut (LNK) files, which trigger 
a dynamic-link library (DLL) search-order-hijacking execution 
chain to load consistently updated PlugX versions. Throughout 
this period, the group repeatedly employed decoy documents 
specific to government and migration policy within Europe. 
Of note, we identified a European government department 
focused on trade communicating with RedDelta command-and-
control (C2) infrastructure in early August 2022. This activity 
commenced on the same day that a RedDelta PlugX sample 
using this C2 infrastructure and featuring an EU trade-themed 
decoy document surfaced on public malware repositories. 
We also identified additional probable victim entities within 
Myanmar and Vietnam regularly communicating with RedDelta 
C2 infrastructure.
RedDelta closely overlaps with public industry reporting 
under the aliases BRONZE PRESIDENT, Mustang Panda, TA416, 
Red Lich, and HoneyMyte.
Key Judgments
•	 RedDelta has consistently conducted long-term cyber-
espionage campaigns in line with the strategic interests 
of the Chinese government, including historical targeting 
of government and public sector organizations across 
Asia and Europe as well as overseas organizations 
associated with minority groups within mainland China 
such as Tibetan and Catholic Church-related entities.
•	 Despite the volume of public reporting on the group’s 
activity, RedDelta employs a high operational tempo 
relative to other state-sponsored actors. The group also 
maintains a rapid pace of development for its flagship 
backdoor (remote access trojan [RAT]), a variant of the 
long-running backdoor PlugX that is heavily customized 
for anti-analysis for detection evasion.
•	 In November 2022, RedDelta actors shifted from using 
archive files to using malicious optical disc image (ISO) 
files containing a simplified shortcut (LNK) file for 
delivery of an updated PlugX payload.

Background
Figure 2: Timeline of RedDelta activity from June 2020 to November 2022 
(Source: Recorded Future)
In mid-2020, we published research identifying RedDelta 
intrusions targeting several Catholic Church-related 
organizations, including the Vatican and the Catholic Diocese of 
Hong Kong. This activity took place in the lead-up to negotiations 
between Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and Vatican officials. 
These findings were also later corroborated by NortonLifeLock. 
In addition to the targeting of entities related to the Catholic 
Church, we also identified RedDelta network intrusions affecting 
law enforcement and government entities in India, a government 
organization in Indonesia, and other targets across Myanmar, 
Hong Kong, and Australia. In this activity the group used multiple 
malware variants including a customized PlugX variant, Cobalt 
Strike, and Poison Ivy.
Shortly after the publication disclosing activity targeting 
the Vatican, we identified renewed RedDelta activity again 
targeting Catholic Church-related organizations as well as an 
entity associated with the Tibetan community-in-exile. Other 
high-profile intrusions conducted by RedDelta in 2020 include 
the compromise of the African Union.
Throughout 2021, we observed continued RedDelta activity 
targeting government organizations in Indonesia, Myanmar, 
and Vietnam. In late 2021 and early 2022, RedDelta targeting 
shifted back toward Europe and the group began using decoy 
documents themed around escalating tensions between Russia 
and Ukraine, and eventually around the war itself, as disclosed 
within customer-facing Insikt Group research and public reporting 
by Proofpoint, Secureworks, and ESET.
Threat/Technical Analysis
Infrastructure Analysis
In March 2022, we and other researchers reported on 
renewed RedDelta activity targeting European government and 
diplomatic organizations, in many cases using lure documents 
centered on the war in Ukraine [1, 2, 3]. Since this reporting, 
we have continued to observe similar activity targeting Europe, 
some of which has been covered through Secureworks reporting.

Malware Analysis
Initial Infection Vector — August to October 2022
The infection vector used from August to October 2022 
remained largely unchanged from recent Secureworks and 
BlackBerry reporting covering RedDelta activity (tracked as 
BRONZE PRESIDENT by Secureworks researchers). In each 
case, an archive file is delivered to the targeted user, likely via 
spearphishing, which contains a Windows shortcut (LNK) file 
disguised using a double extension (such as .doc.lnk) and a 
Microsoft Word icon. The archive also features a series of nested 
hidden folders that contain 3 files used within a DLL search-
order-hijacking triad: a legitimate binary, a malicious DLL loader, 
and an encrypted PlugX payload that is ultimately loaded into 
memory. Upon execution of the shortcut file, this executes the 
legitimate binary vulnerable to DLL search order hijacking and 
also displays a decoy document to the victim.
The observed RedDelta LNK files during this timeframe were 
created on a system with the hostname desktop-n2v1smh, 
which was previously noted in earlier LNK files used by the 
group. In each case, the LNK file contains a similar argument 
to the example shown in Figure 5 in order to run the legitimate 
executable and start the DLL search-order-hijacking chain:
“_\___\_\___\______\_____\__\test11.
bpu||(forfiles /^P %USERPROFILE%\ /S /^M 
“Political Guidance for the new EU approach 
towards Russia.rar” /C “cmd /c (c:\progra~1\7-
Zip\7z x -y -aoa @path||c:\progra~2\7-Zip\7z x 
-y -aoa @path||c:\progra~1\winrar\winrar x -id 
-o+ @path||c:\progra~2\winrar\winrar x -id -o+ @
path)&&_\___\_\___\______\_____\__\test11.bpu”)”

Figure 5: Example of command run by LNK file to trigger DLL search-order-hijacking chain 
(Source: Recorded Future)
In contrast to historical activity, RedDelta has largely moved 
away from use of domain names for C2 infrastructure toward 
hardcoded actor-controlled virtual private server (VPS) IP 
addresses. Since March 2022, the group has used a wide variety 
of autonomous systems (ASs), with a particular preference for 
the following autonomous system numbers (ASNs):
•	 GreenFloid — AS204957
•	 Aptum Technologies — AS13768
•	 Input Output Flood LLC — AS53755
•	 QuadraNet — AS8100
•	 XNNET — AS6134
In many cases, the actor’s operational infrastructure on 
the above ASNs was likely purchased through a China-based 
VPS reseller called Yun-LLC (vm[.]sg). We have also observed 
consistent use of specific server responses and multiple reused 
TLS certificates since March 2022, some of which was referenced 
in recent Blackberry reporting.
Victimology
We observed likely victims in Vietnam and Myanmar 
communicating with RedDelta C2 infrastructure throughout 
2022, which aligns with the typical historical targeting of the 
group. We also identified multiple IP addresses associated with 
a European government department focused on trade regularly 
communicating with the RedDelta C2 IP address 64.34.205[.]178 
on August 9, 2022. On this date, we also observed a RedDelta 
PlugX phishing campaign featuring an EU trade-themed decoy 
document using this C2, which surfaced on public malware 
repositories. We have not observed any further evidence of 
compromise for this organization since this date.

Initial Infection Vector - November 2022
Figure 6: Contents of ISO file “Unilateral statement by the Commission on migration.iso” used in 
November 2022 (Source: Recorded Future)
In November 2022, we identified new RedDelta activity 
using a slightly altered infection chain. In this case an ISO file 
titled “Unilateral statement by the Commission on migration.
iso” was served through the actor-controlled domain microsite-
manager[.]com, which was hosted on IP address 5.34.182[.]68 
at the time of analysis. This IP address also concurrently hosted 
a probable additional RedDelta domain, mashupdatabase[.]com, 
which was registered through GoDaddy at the same time as 
microsite-manager[.]com.
Similar to previously described activity, the ISO contained 
an LNK file and nested hidden folders titled System Volume 
Information containing the DLL search-order-hijacking triad, 
as shown in Figure 6. Notably, in this case the System Volume 
Information folder also contains a desktop.ini file featuring 
a Class ID (CLSID) Key shortcut {F6B6E965-E9B2-444B-9286-
10C9152EDBC5}, which corresponds to the File History utility in 
Microsoft Windows. Interestingly, this folder is interpreted by File 
Explorer as a legitimate shortcut to File History, and redirects 
the user to this utility rather than displaying the true malicious 
contents of the folder that are executed using the LNK file.
Figure 7: User is directed to File History navigator upon clicking System Volume Information folder, 
rather than revealing a series of nested folders containing the PlugX DLL search-order-hijacking 
triad (Source: Recorded Future)
The LNK file in this case (Figure 8) was simplified compared 
to the one described in Figure 5 and no longer used previously 
reported user metadata, likely in reaction to public reporting 
highlighting this aspect.

Use of European Government Trade- and Migration-
Themed Decoy Documents
In all identified RedDelta samples observed from August to 
November 2022, the user was shown a decoy document specific 
to government and migration policy within Europe, including: an 
Austrian immigration program (Red-White-Red Card); a European 
Union (EU) trade and migration policy; Serbia’s EU accession 
application; and political guidance on the EU’s approach toward 
Russia. These samples ultimately load the group’s customized 
variant of the PlugX backdoor. Notably, in at least one case the 
group appeared to have edited a publicly available document 
(the European Commission Serbia Report 2022) to make it 
appear more sensitive. This included the inclusion of “SENSITIVE” 
and “need to know” distribution markings with the rest of the 
document remaining unchanged, despite the finalized version 
being publicly available at the time of the observed activity. We 
previously observed RedDelta using a similar tactic to mark a 
publicly available United Nations General Assembly report as an 
“Advanced Unedited Version”.
In each case, all the necessary components for loading the 
final payload are included within the initial container file. Earlier 
in 2022, the group regularly employed an interim stage where 
a loader fetched all of these components from a remote actor-
controlled server. This loader step has been replaced by the 
aforementioned use of LNK files and, more recently, by the use 
of archive files with an ISO file.

PlugX Loading Mechanism and Payload
After being executed through the legitimate binary, the DLL 
loader is responsible for decrypting the PlugX payload (the .dat 
files listed in Table 1) prior to passing execution off to them. 
While RedDelta has consistently updated the decryption routine 
used, we have observed this routine changing more frequently 
throughout 2022. The developers of the PlugX variant used in 
RedDelta activity had previously used a prepended XOR key, 
but have since switched to various iterations of XOR decryption 
schemes that don’t rely on the XOR key being prepended to the 
file.

The formula for this sample is

However, this can be simplified down 
to byte ^ key. For either formula, 
the key is incremented by the same 
hardcoded value between each XOR 
operation. The decryption begins a 
few bytes from the start of the file.

Table 2: Evolution in payload-encoding mechanism observed in RedDelta PlugX samples from 
August to November 2022 (Source: Recorded Future)
The PlugX samples continue to use an encrypted configuration 
that contains values such as C2, mutex, file path, decoy document 
file name, and a custom marker (extracted configurations are 
included in Appendix C). The mutex and file path continue to 
follow a pattern of being named after the legitimate executable 
filename followed by 3 (file path) or 6 (mutex) random letters. 
This has been a consistent attribute of RedDelta PlugX use for 
several years.
All of the PlugX files contain a decoy document in the overlay 
section of the Windows executable that is subsequently shown 
to the user, as displayed in Figure 10. The HTTP POST headers 
observed in the latest PlugX samples also remain identical to 
versions described in ESET and Proofpoint reporting from March 
2022, with the exception of the hard-coded User-Agent value.

Mitigations
•	 Configure your intrusion detection systems (IDS), 
intrusion prevention systems (IPS), or any network 
defense mechanisms in place to alert on — and upon 
review, consider blocking illicit connection attempts 
from — the external IP addresses and domains listed in 
Appendix A.
•	 Where possible, alert on use of known disk image file 
types, such as ISO, and shortcut files, which have been 
increasingly abused by threat actors in recent times. 
Furthermore, organizations should consider disabling 
auto-mounting of ISO files.
•	 Practice network segmentation and ensure special 
protections exist for sensitive information, such as multi-
factor authentication and extremely restricted access 
and storage on systems only accessible via an internal 
network.
•	 Disable basic and legacy authentication where possible, 
as these can allow attackers to bypass in-place security 
measures.
•	 Keep all software and applications up to date — in 
particular, operating systems, antivirus software, and 
core system utilities.
•	 Filter email correspondence and scrutinize attachments 
for malware.
•	 Employ host-based controls; one of the best defenses 
and warning signals to thwart attacks is to conduct 
client-based host-logging and intrusion detection 
capabilities.
•	 Implement basic incident response and detection 
deployments and controls like network IDS, netflow 
collection, host-logging, and web proxy, alongside human 
monitoring of detection sources.
Outlook
RedDelta continues to be a highly persistent threat activity 
group conducting operations targeting organizations across 
Asia and Europe. Throughout 2022, we have identified RedDelta 
operators iterating and adding new defense evasion and anti-
analysis methods to the group’s customized PlugX variant at a 
rapid pace. Despite this, many elements of the group’s TTPs 
have remained consistent over time. While RedDelta has shown 
a propensity for targeting certain geographic regions over many 
years, particularly Vietnam and Myanmar, the group has also 
demonstrated the ability to quickly shift targeting in line with 
emerging geopolitical developments.
