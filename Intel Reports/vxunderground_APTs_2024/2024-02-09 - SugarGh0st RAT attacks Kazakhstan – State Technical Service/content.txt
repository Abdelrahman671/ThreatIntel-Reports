In November 2023, the Cisco Talos research group published a report in which it provided details of the SugarGh0st RAT
malware cyberattack. Experts confirmed evidence that the infrastructure of a number of foreign countries was attacked using
this malicious program. After analyzing the cyberattack, Cisco Talos came to the conclusion that the SugarGh0st RAT malware
was allegedly created by a pro-government group in a third country.
At the end of December 2023, GTS JSC, using the funds of the NKCIB, recorded a mass phishing mailing to email addresses
belonging to one of the government bodies of the Republic of Kazakhstan. The attackers created an address on the Yahoo
mail service that imitated the email address of an employee of the press service of a government agency of the Republic of
Kazakhstan.
Attached to the letter was an RAR archive, which contained a self-extracting archive (SFX - self-extracting archive) with a
Microsoft Word icon, which misleads the user. When SFX is launched, the contents are unpacked into the %TEMP% directory
and using the “~tmp.vbs” script, the “update.dll” library is installed as a Logon Script. The user was also shown a decoy
document containing a Happy New Year greeting.
When the “update.dll” library was launched, the “authz.lib” file was read and its contents were decrypted using a dynamic XOR
key, after which control was transferred to the beginning of the shellcode section.
The shellcode performs the Reflective Loading procedure, loading a program in PE32 format, which is stored in its body in
encrypted form. The specified program is a SugarGh0st RAT with the control center address “account.drive-google-com[.]tk”.
The functionality of the malware corresponds to the description given in the Cisco Talos publication and includes file system
management, loading/uploading data (files) to the C&C server, managing services and processes, making changes to the
registry, managing windows and transmitting keys/mouse clicks, and also has keylogger and screenlogger functions.
In addition, SugarGh0st RAT has the ability to download additional malicious modules. So, the program searches for files that
are located in the %PROGRAM_FILES%\Common Files\DESIGNER directory. If the file has an .OLE extension, the program
tries to load this file as a library and call the export function “O”.
Conclusion
Thus, evidence has been obtained that the hacker group behind the SugarGh0st RAT malware, in addition to other countries,
also attacks users in Kazakhstan.
We will continue to monitor the activity of this group.
