RUSSIA
BlueCharlie, Previously Tracked 
as TAG-53, Continues to Deploy 
New Infrastructure in 2023
CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS
Executive Summary
Since at least March 2023, Insikt Group has tracked new infrastructure that we attribute as associated
with the threat activity group BlueCharlie, a group that has overlaps with the Russia-nexus group
publicly known as Callisto/Calisto, COLDRIVER, and Star Blizzard/SEABORGIUM. Insikt Group previously
tracked this threat activity under the temporary designator TAG-53. We are now graduating this threat
cluster to the cryptonym BlueCharlie due to overlapping tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and
our increased confidence that the activities we have observed are conducted by a Russia-based threat
actor.
Insikt Group has observed BlueCharlie build new infrastructure, which includes 94 new domains.
Several of the TTPs currently seen in the recent operation depart from past activity, suggesting that
BlueCharlie is evolving its operations, potentially in response to public disclosures of its operations in
industry reporting (1, 2, 3). Since Insikt Group’s initial tracking of the group in September 2022, we have
observed BlueCharlie engage in several TTP shifts. These shifts demonstrate that these threat actors
are aware of industry reporting and show a certain level of sophistication in their efforts to obfuscate or
modify their activity, aiming to stymie security researchers. Some of the changes in TTPs were also
likely precipitated by the threat group’s increased awareness of operations security (OPSEC).
While Insikt Group was unable to determine victimology or targeting for this campaign at the time of this
writing, BlueCharlie has in the past targeted entities in the government, higher education, defense, and
political sectors, as well as non-governmental organizations (NGOs), activists, journalists, think tanks,
and national laboratories. Potential victims in those sectors should improve their phishing defenses,
implement FIDO2-compliant multi-factor authentication, use threat intelligence and attack surface
intelligence for rapid and complete information, and educate third-party vendors on the risks involved.
Failure to do so may result in the loss of credentials to business-critical resources, leaking of
proprietary information related to business or national security, and damage to brand reputation for
suffering a breach.
Key Findings
●
BlueCharlie continues to build new infrastructure in the pursuit of phishing campaigns and
credential harvesting, and it continues to favor certain elements such as the use of preferred
registrars, ASNs, and a certificate authority.
●
While the group uses relatively common techniques to conduct attacks (such as the use of
phishing and a historical reliance on open-source offensive security tools), its likely continued
use of these methods, determined posture, and progressive evolution of tactics suggests the
group remains formidable and capable.
●
Given the group’s observed operational tempo and willingness to adapt to public reporting on its
activity, we expect to see BlueCharlie continue operations for the foreseeable future. We
similarly expect the group to continue to evolve its TTPs based on precedent.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS
Background
BlueCharlie is a Russia-linked threat activity group that has links to groups that have been active since
at least 2017. BlueCharlie conducts operations focused on information gathering to enable further
espionage, but also for use in hack-and-leak operations. BlueCharlie targets individuals and
organizations in North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) nations, entities in Ukraine, and institutions
like government, higher education, defense, and political sectors, non-governmental organizations
(NGOs), activists, journalists, think tanks, and national laboratories. Past incidents include a
hack-and-leak operation that tried to build a narrative around high-level Brexit proponents planning a
coup as well as a cyberespionage campaign targeting Brookhaven National Laboratory, Argonne
National Laboratory, and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory between August and September
2022. In January 2023, cybersecurity firm Nisos observed personally identifiable information related to
technical details of COLDRIVER campaigns, and found ties to a Russian national, Andrey Korinets, as a
potential member of the group. Insikt Group has not independently verified Korinets’s affiliation with
BlueCharlie activity at this time.
BlueCharlie has carried out persistent phishing and credential theft campaigns that further enable
intrusions and data theft. The group likely uses open sources to conduct extensive reconnaissance in
advance of intrusion operations in order to improve the likelihood that its spearphishing operations will
succeed. In at least one case, Star Blizzard/SEABORGIUM created fraudulent profiles on various social
media platforms, including LinkedIn, to conduct reconnaissance on targeted entities. Some of the
messages included resources that spoofed pages from prominent organizations to build credibility.
Campaigns between 2015 and 2020 relied on emails purporting to come from popular mail services and
often contained malicious links or attachments.
Threat and Technical Analysis
Following public reporting (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), including our own, we observed that BlueCharlie changed its
TTPs as of at least mid-December 2022 — shortly after our report and other industry reporting
exposed its credential harvesting infrastructure.
Domain Name Structure
Since the release of our initial report describing TAG-53 activity, the threat group has shifted its use of
certain words in its domains to a new pattern.
In our previous report, all but 1 of the 38 domains discovered via BlueCharlie tracking used similarly
structured domain names, primarily made up of 2 terms (depicted in Figure 1 below) separated by a
hyphen, such as “cloud-safety[.]online”. The exception to the above rule was proxycrioisolation[.]com.
While the structure has changed for the most recent activity, the new naming convention is consistent
and highly similar across all 94 observed domains. Prior activity relied on a trailing URL structure for

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS
phishing attacks, such as http[:]//goo-ink[.]online/adfs[.]llnl[.g]ov/ks/ (1, 2), which emulates a
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory Microsoft Active Directory instance. This shift in tactics away
from trailing URL structures to the new hyphenated, random-word naming convention has stymied the
identification of victims and targeting by the group in this most recent campaign. The use of these
trailing URLs can be configured in the config.yaml file of Evilginx, an open-source offensive security
1
tool previously used by BlueCharlie. While we have identified a number of new domains, we have not
observed the use of these trailing URL paths at the time of this writing; however, this does not preclude
their active use.

Since at least December 17, 2022, BlueCharlie has chosen domain-naming themes centered around
information technology and cryptocurrency, shown in Figure 2, with domain names such as
cloudrootstorage[.]com, directexpressgateway[.]com, storagecryptogate[.]com, or
pdfsecxcloudroute[.]com. Appendix A contains a complete list of the identified domains. Almost all of
the domains we identified share this theme and are consistent, similar to prior BlueCharlie conventions.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS
We have not observed any direct impersonation of target domains at this time, such as the previously
observed dtgruelle-us[.]com or mvd-redir[.]ru, which emulate a US logistics company and the Russian
Ministry of Internal Affairs, respectively — a departure from past behavior.
Registrars
Figure 3: Breakdown of domain registrars used by BlueCharlie in the previous campaign, January to November 2022 (Source:
Recorded Future)
In previous reporting, we identified that for the majority of their domain registrations, BlueCharlie
preferred the Porkbun registrar, followed by NameCheap, Regway, and REG RU, depicted in the graph in
Figure 3 above.
In BlueCharlie’s current activity, the group overwhelmingly preferred the registrar NameCheap, with 78
out of 94 identified domains being registered through this service, depicted in Figure 4 below.
Nevertheless, the group showed signs of its past preferences, such as the registration of the
webgateway[.]ru and deskactivitygm[.]com domains through Regway, and
threatcenterofreaserch[.]com registered via Porkbun, which was previously identified in open sources in
Calisto’s older campaign and also reappears under the aforementioned newly identified infrastructure.

Additionally, industry reporting suggests that Stark Industries, MIRhosting, and Perfect Quality (PQ)
Hosting (all present in the current activity) are related to Ivan Neculiti, a Moldovan national.
Cybersecurity firm Team Cymru stated that it frequently observes “all three hosting companies being
used to host malicious content, or … used directly for attack infrastructure”, specifying that “the website
hucksters[.]net, which amongst other things seeks to expose individuals involved in fraud and spam,
has previously profiled NECULITI”.
X.509 TLS Certificates
Previously, all identified BlueCharlie domains were found to host corresponding X.509 TLS certificates
provided by Let’s Encrypt. The prevalent use of Let’s Encrypt TLS certificates allows for further
correlations between BlueCharlie domains and infrastructure, strengthening the clustering of this
activity. The group continues to rely almost exclusively on Let’s Encrypt security certificates. The only
exception to this rule that we identified was the domain bittechllc[.]net, which used the ZeroSSL
Certificate Authority. The remainder relied on Let’s Encrypt certificates. See, for example, the
cloudrootstorage[.]com domain’s certificate as found at crt.sh and depicted in Figure 6 below.

Mitigations
Phishing and spearphishing from state-sponsored advanced persistent threat (APT) groups presents an
imminent threat to organization networks and personal information. Phishing allows a threat actor
access to privileged material or the ability to install their own exploit software, such as ransomware or
command-and-control software.
●
Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) on all internet-facing web applications and
appliances, especially webmail. MFA is something you know (a password) and something you
have (a text message or code from a MFA application). This way, if a threat actor has your
password, they are likely unable to authenticate as they lack the MFA code.
Recorded Future® | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group
10
CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS
●
Use a FIDO2-compliant MFA token.
●
Train employees, contractors, and third-party vendors to protect against phishing,
spearphishing, and social engineering. Refreshing employees, vendors, contractors and
third-party entities with this phishing training often (at least annually) is critical to prevent
credential harvesting and unwanted intrusions to your network.
●
Disable all macros, particularly macros loading by default, in Microsoft Office products.
●
Ensure that all attachments are scanned for malicious artifacts and behavior.
●
Enforce a frequent password reset policy and strong password requirements for all
internet-facing web applications and internal applications, especially webmail/email.
●
Use a stand-alone password manager (such as BitWarden or 1Password) to generate strong
passwords, and use unique passwords for each service. Passwords should not be reused across
services/websites.
●
Configure your intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention systems (IPS), or any
network defense mechanisms in place to alert on — and upon review, consider blocking
connection attempts to and from — the external IP addresses and domains listed in the
appendix.
Outlook
BlueCharlie has demonstrated the ability to adapt and evolve over time to public reporting, and will
likely continue to change their TTPs based on past precedent. Given the group’s historical use of
phishing (which is likely occurring in the new activity), we recommend network defenders employ
robust anti-phishing training and highly encourage the use of a FIDO2-compliant multi-factor
authentication token, such as a Yubikey. Recorded Future Threat Intelligence (TI), Third-Party
Intelligence, and SecOps Intelligence modules users can monitor real-time output from Network
Intelligence analytics to identify suspected targeted intrusion activity involving your organization or key
vendors and partners.
