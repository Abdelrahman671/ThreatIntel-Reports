Since April 2022, Cisco Talos has been tracking a malicious campaign operated by the espionage-motivated
Arid Viper advanced persistent threat (APT) group targeting Arabic-speaking Android users. In this campaign,
the actors leverage custom mobile malware, also known as Android Package files (APKs), to collect sensitive
information from targets and deploy additional malware onto infected devices.
Although Arid Viper is believed to be based out of Gaza, Cisco Talos has no evidence indicating or refuting that
this campaign is related in any way to the Israel-Hamas war. Furthermore, the publication of this research was
delayed while Talos was performing the due diligence with law enforcement.
The mobile malware used in this campaign shares similarities with a non-malicious online dating application,
referred to as Skipped. The malware specifically uses a similar name and the same shared project on the
applications’ development platform. This overlap suggests the Arid Viper operators are either linked to
Skipped’s developer or somehow gained illicit access to the shared project’s database. 
Our analysis uncovered an array of simulated dating applications that are linked to Skipped, leading us to
assess that Arid Viper operators may seek to leverage these additional applications in future malicious
campaigns.
In order to coerce users into downloading their mobile malware, Arid Viper operators share malicious links
masquerading as updates to the dating applications, that instead deliver malware to the user’s device.
Arid Viper’s Android malware has a number of features that enable the operators to disable security
notifications, collect users’ sensitive information, and deploy additional malicious applications on the
compromised device.
Arid Viper mobile malware shares similarities with non-malicious dating application
The mobile malware deployed by Arid Viper in this campaign shares similarities with the non-malicious dating
application Skipped, in that it has a similar name and uses the same shared project on the application development
2/15
platform Firebase. These overlaps, explained in further detail below, suggest the Arid Viper operators may be linked
to Skipped’s developers, and/or they may have illicitly copied characteristics of the non-malicious application in order
to entice and deceive users into downloading their malware. Of note, the technique of leveraging legitimate
application names in order to coerce users into downloading malicious software is in line with the “honey trap” tactics
used by Arid Viper in the past.
The name of Arid Viper’s mobile malware, “Skipped_Messenger,” appears to be a reference to Skipped, which is
listed on some application stores as “Skipped - Chat, Match & Dating.” The “Skipped_Messenger” malware uses
Google’s Firebase messaging system as a command and control (C2) channel, while the non-malicious Skipped
application uses it for pushing out notifications. Google’s Firebase messaging system works via the creation of a
named project, along with other unique identifiers. This project is protected with a set of credentials and API keys. In
order for developers to write applications that use the same project and Firebase databases, they need credentials in
the form of API keys, and project and application IDs that are generated in the Firebase project’s console. 
The Android malware deployed in this malicious campaign extensively uses the same Firebase databases used by
Skipped, however, both the malware and the non-malicious application use their own set of distinct credentials,
including API keys and Client Application IDs. This observation indicates that the malware developers had access to
the same Firebase project and backend database that are used by the non-malicious dating application, and
generated their own set of credentials. 
Talos also considered, though assessed it was unlikely, that Skipped’s Firebase databases were configured in test
mode, made publicly available, and abused by Arid Viper. Test mode allows a developer to quickly set up a database
for testing purposes, which makes it available to everyone who knows the URL. This mode needs to be set when the
database is first created and is only available for 30 days. After this duration, the database is locked and needs to be
specifically re-configured to provide public access. The passive DNS data for the Skipped Firebase project’s domain
shows that the URL for the database was first seen on August 9, 2021, while Arid Viper’s malware started using this
infrastructure beginning on November 11, 2022. Given the malware used Skipped’s Firebase project almost a year
after the infrastructure was set up (and well outside the 30 day window of public access), it is unlikely Arid Viper
leveraged unintentional public access to the database.
Furthermore, this mode does not provide any management capabilities for the overall Firebase project, but rather
only provides data read and write capabilities to the backend database. The generation of API keys and registration
of the Android malware for the project would still need to be provisioned on the project’s management console.
Finally, Talos found no public evidence of the Firebase/Google Cloud project being compromised such that it may be
used by any parties except the project’s original creators. This supports our assessment that Skipped developers
likely shared their Firebase project with Arid Viper operators.
As seen below, the malware used by Arid Viper in this campaign is very similar to remote access trojans (RATs) used
by the threat actor in previous campaigns. The previous versions of the malware all allude to the Skipped application,
either via references in Android package names or in the malware’s Graphical User Interface (GUI).

“Skipped” dating App.
A web of related dating applications may present opportunities for future campaigns
Our analysis uncovered an extended web of companies that create dating-themed applications that are similar or
identical to Skipped. Given the aforementioned connections between Arid Viper’s mobile malware and Skipped, we
assess that Arid Viper operators may seek to leverage the infrastructure and/or names of these additional
applications in future malicious campaigns.
The publisher of Skipped, a company called “Skipped GmbH,” was registered and is headquartered in Germany,
and appears to be linked to a multitude of seemingly non-malicious dating applications published by companies in
Singapore and Dubai. We found that the domains used by these additional companies to distribute their dating
applications, which are available on the Google and Apple application stores, were registered by Skipped GmbH. 
Most of these applications provide their users with a chatting service, where no face-to-face interaction is possible.
During these conversations, the application will interrupt and request the user buys “coins” in order to continue the
interaction. This feature is notable as, if there is a current or potential connection between Arid Viper and these
applications, it could generate revenue for the APT operators. 
The following online dating applications that are connected to Skipped GmbH can be installed from the Google Play
Store or the Apple App Store:
“SKIPPED - Chat, Match & Dating” : 50K downloads on Google Play.
“Joostly - Dating App! Singles,” : 10K downloads on Google Play.
“VIVIO - Chat, flirt & Dating” : Available on Apple App Store.
“Meeted (previously Joostly) - Flirt, Chat & Dating” :  Available on Apple App Store.

We were able to connect Skipped GmbH, the central entity in this ecosystem, to individual(s) operating under multiple
monikers. Pivoting off the individual(s) we were able to identify at least three different yet related companies in
Germany that author and distribute mobile applications that are usually dating-themed:
Company Name
Established Date
Skipped GmbH
Feb 13, 2023
Dateed GmbH

Pyramids Media GmbH Jan 28, 2019
These applications are distributed over both Apple and Google’s application stores and use German in their
advertisements and content. All of these applications contain romance or dating themes, a common characteristic of
applications abused by the Arid Viper group in the past.
Talos discovered multiple domains registered by Skipped GmbH that serve as product home pages and host artifacts
like application service agreements. The applications that these domains pertain to are all romance and dating
themed and are distributed on the App Stores using a variety of publisher entities. A high-level timeline of events for
the companies, domains and applications involved in this ecosystem is shown below:

Although there is a concrete connection between Skipped GmbH and the domains associated with these applications
as evidenced by their domain registration information, it is currently unclear if there is a direct relationship between
Skipped GmbH and the other developers listed above that distribute these applications. 
Talos produced a graph to map the connections between the application companies, domains, and websites, which
can be seen below. This graph includes a connection to Arid Viper’s Android malware based on the malware’s
overlapping use of Firebase with Skipped, as explained above. At the center of the graph lies Skipped GmbH, which
is used for registering domains and establishing websites for the various dating applications. These applications and
their websites are connected to additional developers and publishers located globally. For example, the “Joula”
application is distributed by a company called “NYUTAINMENT PTE. LTD”, based out of Singapore. However, the
domain for Joula, joula[.]app was registered by Skipped GmbH. 
Notably, although this ecosystem of applications and publishers cannot be explicitly categorized as a scam operation,
at least one of these companies, NYUTAINMENT PTE. LTD, was issued Cease and Desist orders in January 2022 by
the Berlin Regional Court for operating websites and applications using fake profiles.

Malicious campaign distributes mobile malware disguised as legitimate application updates
Arid Viper’s latest campaign, which Talos observed occurring since at least April 2022, targets Arabic-speaking
Android users through mobile malware that masquerades as application updates. Arid Viper has a history of
disguising their malware as updates, either for dating applications or for popular messaging applications such as
WhatsApp, Signal, or Telegram. The attackers typically send targets a link to a tutorial video for the application, which
is posted on a media-sharing website like YouTube. 
The tutorial video will provide a step-by-step account of all features of the application and instructions on how to
operate it in Arabic, suggesting a specific targeting of Arabic-speaking individuals. One such video depicts an
individual narrating in Arabic in Levantine dialect. A URL is provided in the video’s description, which directs to an
attacker-controlled domain that serves a copy of Arid Viper’s APK malware.
7/15
Youtube video with link to download malicious APK (Arabic language).
Talos identified a YouTube account that hosted such a video. The account was created on March 17, 2022 and has
uploaded only one video, suggesting Arid Viper may use such accounts to host a limited number of videos at a time.
The video, as shown in the screen capture above, had approximately 50 views at the time of writing.
We assess that all the domains used by the attackers in this campaign are solely registered, operated and controlled
by Arid Viper. These domains follow the same naming schema observed in previous Arid Viper infrastructure and are
not only used to host malicious APKs, but also act as C2 servers for the implants. The domains are typically
administered by the attackers by using webshells such as “ALFA TEaM Shell”.
ALFA TEaM web shell prompt on Arid Viper’s domain.
As previously mentioned, some of the malware deployed in this campaign used Google’s Firebase platform as C2
infrastructure for the malicious applications. The Firebase platform primarily serves as a C2 channel to issue
commands and to download and upload files. The platform also has the ability to provide a new C2 server address to
the malware so that it can switch fr,m the Firebase platform to another attacker-controlled C2 host. One of the
Firebase projects used by Arid Viper in this campaign dates back to 2021 and has some non-malicious mobile APKs
associated with it, indicating operators have been trying to create, test and popularize other APK software out of the
same account for years.

Mobile malware enables operators to collect targets’ information and deploy additional
malware 
Arid Viper’s Android malware has a number of features that enable the operators to surreptitiously collect sensitive
information from victims’ devices and deploy additional executables. The malware uses native code to hide some of
its activities, meaning it can leverage Android’s capability that allows for the execution of assembly-based shared
libraries. Android applications can usually be built from Java code, however, for performance reasons, applications
have the ability to load libraries which are compiled into native code (shared libraries). This native code is also harder
to analyze and reverse engineer.
Once deployed, the malware attempts to hide itself on a victim machine by disabling system or security notifications
from the operating system. The malware completely disables notifications on Samsung mobile devices and on any
device with an Android package that contains the word “security”. The malware makes notifications less visible on
Huawei, Google, Oppo and Xiaomi mobile devices.
This malware loads a library typically called “libuoil.so” or “libdalia.so”, which exports four main functions. Each of
these functions will return the name of an administration package installed by vendors on their version of the Android
Open Source Project (AOSP). 
Example of an exported function
These names will then be used to hide notifications from the security packages from the four vendors mentioned
above. It is unclear why these vendors require a different obfuscation procedure since the code strings are not
obfuscated in the native code library.
Arid Viper has been using native code libraries since at least 2021 with the intent of obfuscating C2 hostnames.
However, in this campaign, the strings are not obfuscated at all and are used just to nullify the notifications from built-
in security packages, a notable development in the way in which the threat actor is developing and packaging their
Android malware.
The malware is configured to obtain a number of permissions from the infected device, including the ability to:
Record audio
Read contacts
Disable Keyguard, which disables keylocks and associated password security measures
Read call logs
Send, receive and read SMS messages
View and change Wi-Fi settings
Kill background apps
Read contents of external storage
Access the camera to take pictures and record video
9/15
Retrieve information on currently running tasks on the device
Download files without notifications to users
Create system alerts
These capabilities and the code used to implement them are explored in greater detail below.
From the capability point of view, this RAT exhibits all the classic functionalities of an Android-based RAT including
system fingerprinting, data exfiltration and payload deployment, to name a few.
Executes trojanized apps
The malware has the capability to download additional malware, which is typically masquerading as updates for
legitimate applications. It can also display notifications that specific applications have updates available, potentially
prompting users to install the malicious updates. The malware has the capability to download, rename, and run the
following applications:
“.whatsapp-update.apk” to “whatsapp-update.apk”
“.messenger-update.apk” to “messenger-update.apk”
“.google-play-update.apk” to “google-play-update.apk”
“.instagram-update.apk” to “instagram-update.apk”

App name construction.
Retrieves system information
The implant has the ability to get system information from locations such as “/proc/cpuinfo“, and from systems
services such as “activity”. It will also get memory information from the device using the StatFs API which is a
wrapper for statvfs() Unix call.
The malware can retrieve the following SIM information for dual SIM devices for each SIM:
11/15
Number of SIM slots
SIM state
SIM Service Provider Name (SPN)
SIM serial number
SIM Device ID (IMEI or MEID)
SIM subscriber ID (IMSI)
It can also retrieve the following battery information for the device:
Battery health
Battery status
Average battery level
The malware can identify the manufacturer of the device if it is one of the following: 
Huawei
Xaomi
Vivo
Oppo
It can get the following network information:
Public IPv4 and IPv6 address using https://api.ipify.org
MAC address
WIFI network name
Finally, the malware is able to retrieve additional information, including:
Whether the phone supports 2G, 3G, or 4G
Device ID
Email address of account associated with the phone
Device brand and model.
OS release and API versions
Receives additional C2 domains from the current C2
The Android implant can ask the current C2 for an updated C2 domain and store it in its configuration, as shown
below:
Exfiltrates collected credentials
It can also exfiltrate credentials collected from Facebook and relay them to the C2 server:
Record, send and receive calls and SMS messages
The implant has the ability to record telephone calls made on the compromised device. This is done by recording the
MIC audio source, capturing the recording to a specified location on disk, and subsequently uploading all files in the
directory to the C2 server.
12/15
The malware can also capture SMS messages received by the device, send new SMS messages, and make calls to
phone numbers specified by the C2:
Send SMS
Make calls
Finally, the implant records the following information for all SMS messages stored on the compromised device:
Sender ID and address 
Body/content 
Read status 
Date received 
Type
Record contacts
13/15
The malware can record contact information from the device and save it in a file in a folder specified by the implant:
Contact ID
Display name
Phone number
Record call history
The implant has the ability to record the call history information on the compromised device and save it in a specific
file and folder. This information can include: 
Phone number and name of caller
Call type, either incoming or outgoing
Call date and time
Call duration in seconds
Exfiltrate files
Finally, Arid Viper’s malware has the ability to copy all files with the following extensions in a specified directory to
another directory for exfiltration to C2: jpg, jpeg, png, pdf, doc, docx, ppt, pptx, xls, mpp, accdb, xlsx, mdb
