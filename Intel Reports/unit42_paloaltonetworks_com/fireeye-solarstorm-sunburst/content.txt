Unit 42 tracks this and related activity as the group named SolarStorm, and has published an ATOM containing the observed techniques, IOCs and relevant courses of action in the Unit 42 ATOM Viewer. According to FireEye, SolarStorm has compromised organizations across the globe via a supply chain attack that consists of a trojanized update file for the SolarWinds Orion Platform.\r\n\r\nFireEye\u2019s blog, \u201cHighly Evasive Attacker Leverages SolarWinds Supply Chain to Compromise Multiple Global Victims with SUNBURST Backdoor,\u201d contains a wealth of useful information, all of which has been analyzed by Unit 42 researchers to help ensure Palo Alto Networks customers are protected.\r\n\r\nAny organization utilizing SolarWinds Orion IT management software is potentially at risk from this threat. These organizations should immediately identify Orion systems in their network, determine if they are compromised with the SUNBURST backdoor and seek out further evidence of compromise. Instructions on how to perform these tasks using the Palo Alto Networks Next Generation Firewall, Cortex XDR and XSOAR are available in this report, as well as additional resources and indicators of compromise (IOCs). Palo Alto Networks has also launched SolarStorm Rapid Response Programs.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe details of this attack and its impact continue to evolve. We will update this report with new details as they become available.\r\nWhat\u2019s Known About SolarStorm and SUNBURST\r\n\r\n \tSolarStorm specifically targeted supply chains during their attack on SolarWinds\u2019 Orion IT performance and statistics monitoring software.\r\n \tSolarStorm is a highly skilled threat actor, with a significant operational security mindset, as can be observed in its post-exploitation activity.\r\n \tSolarWinds recently filed an SEC report indicating that, while they have over 300,000 customers, fewer than 18,000 customers were running the trojanized version of the Orion software.\r\n \tSolarStorm threat actors created a legitimate digitally signed backdoor, SUNBURST, as a trojanized version of a SolarWinds Orion plug-in. The trojanized software acts as a powerful supply chain infiltration mechanism for delivery.\r\n \tSUNBURST has been observed delivering multiple payloads, mostly focused on memory-only droppers, such as the FireEye-dubbed TEARDROP and Cobalt Strike BEACON.\r\n \tSUNBURST\u2019s command and control (C2) traffic masquerades as legitimate Orion Improvement Program traffic.\r\n \tFireEye has released signatures and specific indicators to help identify SolarStorm\u2019s activity.\r\n\r\nFireEye\u2019s research has been a cornerstone in providing not only useful signatures, but also indicators which help with tracking and hunting for SolarStorm activity. A synopsis of those indicators is included below.\r\nSUNBURST\r\nAt the time of this publication, the Windows Installer Patch file including the trojanized version of the SolarWinds Orion product was still reachable:\r\n\r\nFilename: SolarWinds-Core-v2019.4.5220-Hotfix5.msp\r\nSHA256: d0d626deb3f9484e649294a8dfa814c5568f846d5aa02d4cdad5d041a29d5600\r\n\r\nThis installer contains:\r\n\r\n \tLegitimate SolarWinds Orion update components.\r\n \tA digitally signed SUNBURST backdoor, and its legitimate configuration file:\r\n\r\n \tSHA256: 32519b85c0b422e4656de6e6c41878e95fd95026267daab4215ee59c107d6c77\r\n\r\n \tFilename: SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll\r\n \tCertificate SN: 0f:e9:73:75:20:22:a6:06:ad:f2:a3:6e:34:5d:c0:ed\r\n\r\n\r\n \tSHA256: efbec6863f4330dbb702cc43a85a0a7c29d79fde0f7d66eac9a3be43493cab4f\r\n\r\n \tFilename: SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll.config\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe infrastructure related to this series of attacks includes:\r\n\r\n \tTrojanized update file hosted at:\r\n\r\n \thxxps:\/\/downloads.solarwinds[.]com\/solarwinds\/CatalogResources\/Core\/2019.4\/2019.4.5220.20574\/SolarWinds-Core-v2019.4.5220-Hotfix5.msp\r\n\r\n\r\n \tDGA-generated C2s as subdomains of:\r\n\r\n \tavsvmcloud[.]com\r\n\r\n\r\n \tC2 domains found during SUNBURST incidents, including CNAME records, or subsequent phases of the incident, such as BEACON components:\r\n\r\n \tfreescanonline[.]com\r\n \tdeftsecurity[.]com\r\n \tthedoccloud[.]com\r\n \twebsitetheme[.]com\r\n \thighdatabase[.]com\r\n \tincomeupdate[.]com\r\n \tdatabasegalore[.]com\r\n \tpanhardware[.]com\r\n \tZupertech[.]com\r\n \tVirtualdataserver[.]com\r\n \tdigitalcollege[.]org\r\n \tsolartrackingsystem[.]net\r\n \twebcodez[.]com\r\n \tseobundlekit[.]com\r\n \tvirtualwebdata[.]com\r\n \tlcomputers[.]com\r\n \tavsvmcloud[.]com\r\n \tMobilnweb[.]com\r\n \tkubecloud[.]com\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTEARDROP\r\nSUNBURST deployed several different payloads, and in at least one instance, a memory-only dropper FireEye dubbed TEARDROP to deploy a Cobalt Strike BEACON. During analysis of the information available, Unit 42 identified related activity involving TEARDROP malware that was used to execute a customized Cobalt Strike BEACON. This sample contains a beacon request to the previously unreported domain mobilnweb[.]com.\r\n\r\nThe TEARDROP DLL has a SHA256 of: 118189f90da3788362fe85eafa555298423e21ec37f147f3bf88c61d4cd46c51\r\n\r\nand contains a beacon request for the URI \/2019\/Person-With-Parnters-Brands-Our\/ with the User-Agent Mozilla\/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit\/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome\/85.0.4183.83 Safari\/537.36. Within that same configuration, we also observed an additional URI setting containing the string \/2019\/This-Person-Two-Join-With\/.\r\nProtecting Our Customers\r\nAs of the time of writing, based on signatures and observables that have been released, Palo Alto Networks customers are protected across our product ecosystem, with specific protections deployed or being deployed in the following products and subscriptions for the Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW). It is imperative for customers to employ the best practices for Palo Alto Networks products in order to ensure your appliances are configured in a manner best suited for your protection.\r\n\r\nDue to the nature of these attacks, we recommend our customers perform the following searches immediately. If you are unable, Palo Alto Networks will help you locate SolarWinds Orion servers owned by your organization and assess whether you\u2019ve been compromised free of charge. After we\u2019ve completed our analysis, we\u2019ll provide you with a SolarStorm Assessment Report brought to you by Expanse and Crypsis.\r\nCortex XDR\r\nCortex XDR customers are protected using the product\u2019s WildFire integration, as well as through Local Analysis, the Password Theft Protection module and the Behavioral Threat Protection (BTP) engine. Protections are continually being evaluated, developed and deployed for Cortex XDR.\r\nCortex XDR Managed Threat Hunting\r\nOur Cortex XDR Managed Threat Hunting Team (MTH) has proactively searched all Cortex XDR Pro customer logs to identify potentially impacted organizations and provide them an assessment of their risk.\u00a0Leverage the power of automation with Cortex XSOAR to speed up the discovery of SolarWind installations within your network, uncover signs of potential SolarStorm activity and automate response actions such as the quarantining of compromised endpoints. \u00a0\u00a0\r\nWildFire (NGFW security subscription)\r\nCustomers using WildFire are protected from downloading known SUNBURST backdoor files and Cobalt Strike BEACON files associated with SolarStorm.\r\n\r\nGap analysis and threat hunting leveraging the FireEye-provided Yara signatures and observables has enabled Unit 42 researchers to identify potential malware samples. We continue to seek out new malware associated with SolarStorm, build and deploy protections for them within WildFire. \r\nAutoFocus\r\nAutoFocus customers can track SolarStorm\u2019s activity in the tags SolarStorm, SUPERNOVA, TEARDROP and SUNBURST.\r\nIoT Security (NGFW security subscriptions)\r\nThe IoT Security subscription has the capability of identifying SolarWinds servers. These devices are being added to the IoT Security user portal UI, and the Device-ID attribute will be pushed to PAN-OS. These devices will be displayed to users as \"SolarWinds Network Management Device\" within the IoT Security user portal UI. In PAN-OS, users will see the Device-ID attribute \"Profile\" = \"SolarWinds Network Management Device\". This feature will be enabled for all IoT Security customers this week.\r\nThreat Prevention DNS Security (NGFW security subscriptions)\r\nThreat Prevention and DNS Security provide protection against C2 beacons and associated traffic.

A few minutes later, you\u2019ll see the status change to \u201cDone\u201d with a timestamp.\r\n\r\nIf any matches were found, you\u2019ll see the \u201c# Of Hits\u201d change from 0 to the amount of hits the system found per IOC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can right-click on the IOC and select \u201cView Associated Alerts\u201d to pivot to the alert page.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhenever you see this icon  next to a rule name in XDR, it means that this is a historic match based on backwards scanning on an IOC or Behavioral IOC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can right-click on the alert to analyze it and drill down into it.\r\n\r\nVice versa, you can run an XQL query with the known IOCs. This will look across file writes, module loads, process executions, network traffic and DNS queries coming either through NGFW, Cortex Agent or any third party network traffic that is ingested into the Cortex XDR Data Lake:\r\ndataset = xdr_data|filter action_file_sha256 in (\"32519b85c0b422e4656de6e6c41878e95fd95026267daab4215ee59c107d6c77\", \"dab758bf98d9b36fa057a66cd0284737abf89857b73ca89280267ee7caf62f3b\", \"eb6fab5a2964c5817fb239a7a5079cabca0a00464fb3e07155f28b0a57a2c0ed\", \"c09040d35630d75dfef0f804f320f8b3d16a481071076918e9b236a321c1ea77\", \"ac1b2b89e60707a20e9eb1ca480bc3410ead40643b386d624c5d21b47c02917c\", \"019085a76ba7126fff22770d71bd901c325fc68ac55aa743327984e89f4b0134\", \"ce77d116a074dab7a22a0fd4f2c1ab475f16eec42e1ded3c0b0aa8211fe858d6\", \"a25cadd48d70f6ea0c4a241d99c5241269e6faccb4054e62d16784640f8e53bc\", \"d3c6785e18fba3749fb785bc313cf8346182f532c59172b69adfb31b96a5d0af\",\r\n\u201c118189f90da3788362fe85eafa555298423e21ec37f147f3bf88c61d4cd46c51\u201d) or action_module_sha256 in (\"32519b85c0b422e4656de6e6c41878e95fd95026267daab4215ee59c107d6c77\", \"dab758bf98d9b36fa057a66cd0284737abf89857b73ca89280267ee7caf62f3b\", \"eb6fab5a2964c5817fb239a7a5079cabca0a00464fb3e07155f28b0a57a2c0ed\", \"c09040d35630d75dfef0f804f320f8b3d16a481071076918e9b236a321c1ea77\", \"ac1b2b89e60707a20e9eb1ca480bc3410ead40643b386d624c5d21b47c02917c\", \"019085a76ba7126fff22770d71bd901c325fc68ac55aa743327984e89f4b0134\", \"ce77d116a074dab7a22a0fd4f2c1ab475f16eec42e1ded3c0b0aa8211fe858d6\", \"a25cadd48d70f6ea0c4a241d99c5241269e6faccb4054e62d16784640f8e53bc\", \"d3c6785e18fba3749fb785bc313cf8346182f532c59172b69adfb31b96a5d0af\",\r\n\u201c118189f90da3788362fe85eafa555298423e21ec37f147f3bf88c61d4cd46c51\u201d) or action_process_image_sha256 in (\"32519b85c0b422e4656de6e6c41878e95fd95026267daab4215ee59c107d6c77\", \"dab758bf98d9b36fa057a66cd0284737abf89857b73ca89280267ee7caf62f3b\", \"eb6fab5a2964c5817fb239a7a5079cabca0a00464fb3e07155f28b0a57a2c0ed\", \"c09040d35630d75dfef0f804f320f8b3d16a481071076918e9b236a321c1ea77\", \"ac1b2b89e60707a20e9eb1ca480bc3410ead40643b386d624c5d21b47c02917c\", \"019085a76ba7126fff22770d71bd901c325fc68ac55aa743327984e89f4b0134\", \"ce77d116a074dab7a22a0fd4f2c1ab475f16eec42e1ded3c0b0aa8211fe858d6\", \"a25cadd48d70f6ea0c4a241d99c5241269e6faccb4054e62d16784640f8e53bc\", \"d3c6785e18fba3749fb785bc313cf8346182f532c59172b69adfb31b96a5d0af\",\r\n\u201c118189f90da3788362fe85eafa555298423e21ec37f147f3bf88c61d4cd46c51\u201d) or dst_action_external_hostname ~= \".*freescanonline.com|.*deftsecurity.com|.*thedoccloud.com|.*websitetheme.com|.*highdatabase.com|.*incomeupdate.com|.*databasegalore.com|.*panhardware.com|.*zupertech.com|.*virtualdataserver.com|.*digitalcollege.org|.*avsvmcloud.com|.*solartrackingsystem.net|.*webcodez.com|.*seobundlekit.com|.*virtualwebdata.com|.*lcomputers.com|.*mobilnweb.com|.*kubecloud.com\" or action_external_hostname ~= \".*freescanonline.com|.*deftsecurity.com|.*thedoccloud.com|.*websitetheme.com|.*highdatabase.com|.*incomeupdate.com|.*databasegalore.com|.*panhardware.com|.*zupertech.com|.*virtualdataserver.com|.*digitalcollege.org|.*avsvmcloud.com|.*solartrackingsystem.net|.*webcodez.com|.*seobundlekit.com|.*virtualwebdata.com|.*lcomputers.com|.*mobilnweb.com|.*kubecloud.com\" or dns_query_name ~= \".*freescanonline.com|.*deftsecurity.com|.*thedoccloud.com|.*websitetheme.com|.*highdatabase.com|.*incomeupdate.com|.*databasegalore.com|.*panhardware.com|.*zupertech.com|.*virtualdataserver.com|.*digitalcollege.org|.*avsvmcloud.com|.*solartrackingsystem.net|.*webcodez.com|.*seobundlekit.com|.*virtualwebdata.com|.*lcomputers.com|.*mobilnweb.com|.*kubecloud.com\"\r\n| fields agent_hostname, causality_actor_process_image_path, actor_process_image_path,action_external_hostname, action_file_path, action_module_path, dst_action_external_hostname, dns_query_name |dedup agent_hostname, causality_actor_process_image_path, \r\nactor_process_image_path,action_external_hostname, action_file_path, action_module_path, dst_action_external_hostname, dns_query_name\r\n\r\n\r\nAs attackers might have used different domains and hashes, we suggest hunting for behavior from the infected SolarWinds executable in addition to searching for known IOCs.\r\n\r\nWe suggest using the following queries to verify that no suspicious activity took place:\r\n\r\n1.

<p>On Sunday, Dec. 13, FireEye released information related to a breach and data exfiltration originating from an unknown actor FireEye is calling UNC2452. Unit 42 tracks this and related activity as the group named SolarStorm, and has published an ATOM containing the observed techniques, IOCs and relevant courses of action in the <a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/atoms/solarstorm/">Unit 42 ATOM Viewer</a>. According to FireEye, SolarStorm has compromised organizations across the globe via a supply chain attack that consists of a trojanized update file for the SolarWinds Orion Platform.</p>
<p>FireEye’s blog, “<a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html">Highly Evasive Attacker Leverages SolarWinds Supply Chain to Compromise Multiple Global Victims with SUNBURST Backdoor</a>,” contains a wealth of useful information, all of which has been analyzed by Unit 42 researchers to help ensure Palo Alto Networks customers are protected.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any organization utilizing SolarWinds Orion IT management software is potentially at risk from this threat. These organizations should immediately identify Orion systems in their network, determine if they are compromised with the SUNBURST backdoor and seek out further evidence of compromise. Instructions on how to perform these tasks using the <a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/fireeye-solarstorm-sunburst/2">Palo Alto Networks Next Generation Firewall</a>, <a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/fireeye-solarstorm-sunburst/3">Cortex XDR and XSOAR</a> are available in this report, as well as <a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/fireeye-solarstorm-sunburst/4">additional resources and indicators of compromise</a> (IOCs). Palo Alto Networks has also launched <a href="https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/solarstorm-rapid-response">SolarStorm Rapid Response Programs</a>. </span></p>
<p>The details of this attack and its impact continue to evolve. We will update this report with new details as they become available.</p>
<h2><a id="post-110239-_gwkv3l2ifbxv"></a>What’s Known About SolarStorm and SUNBURST</h2>
<ul>
<li>SolarStorm specifically targeted supply chains during their attack on SolarWinds’ Orion IT performance and statistics monitoring software.</li>
<li>SolarStorm is a highly skilled threat actor, with a significant operational security mindset, as can be observed in its post-exploitation activity.</li>
<li>SolarWinds recently filed an SEC report indicating that, while they have over 300,000 customers, fewer than 18,000 customers were running the trojanized version of the Orion software.</li>
<li>SolarStorm threat actors created a legitimate digitally signed backdoor, SUNBURST, as a trojanized version of a SolarWinds Orion plug-in. The trojanized software acts as a powerful supply chain infiltration mechanism for delivery.</li>
<li>SUNBURST has been observed delivering multiple payloads, mostly focused on memory-only droppers, such as the FireEye-dubbed TEARDROP and Cobalt Strike BEACON.</li>
<li>SUNBURST’s command and control (C2) traffic masquerades as legitimate Orion Improvement Program traffic.</li>
<li>FireEye has released <a href="https://github.com/fireeye/sunburst_countermeasures">signatures</a> and specific indicators to help identify SolarStorm’s activity.</li>
</ul>
<p>FireEye’s research has been a cornerstone in providing not only useful signatures, but also indicators which help with tracking and hunting for SolarStorm activity. A synopsis of those indicators is included below.</p>

<h4><strong>TEARDROP</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SUNBURST deployed several different payloads, and in at least one instance, a memory-only dropper FireEye dubbed TEARDROP to deploy a Cobalt Strike BEACON. During analysis of the information available, Unit 42 identified related activity involving TEARDROP malware that was used to execute a customized Cobalt Strike BEACON. This sample contains a beacon request to the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">previously unreported domain</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;"> mobilnweb[.]com</span>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The TEARDROP DLL has a SHA256 of: </span><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">118189f90da3788362fe85eafa555298423e21ec37f147f3bf88c61d4cd46c51</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">and contains a beacon request for the URI /2019/Person-With-Parnters-Brands-Our/ with the User-Agent Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/85.0.4183.83 Safari/537.36. Within that same configuration, we also observed an additional URI setting containing the string /2019/This-Person-Two-Join-With/.</span></p>
