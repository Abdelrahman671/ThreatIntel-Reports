Active APT groups in Germany
06.02.2024
Cyber attacks that are not financially motivated but pursue strategic goals are usually not isolated
individual events. Instead, there are long-term, persistent threat actors who repeatedly attack specific
targets. The threat actors thus shape the threat situation. Since these attacker groups pursue certain
strategic goals, the threat situation becomes to a certain extent easier to explain than if it were purely
opportunistic random events. Knowing the threat actors and their current targets allows IT security teams
to better assess the risk profile of their own company or institution.
On this page, the BSI presents the threat actor groups that have been active against targets in Germany
in the last two years, or that have attacked targets in other European countries that could also have been
attacked in Germany in a similar manner. The following table lists the threat actors‘ name with aliases,
the sectors in which the thret actor is active and, if relevant, special characteristics that can facilitate
detection or incident handling.
Institutions that have already implemented basic IT security measures can use this list to prioritize their
own threat intelligence research.

The sources for the list are diverse, for example detections in government networks, incidents from BSI
incident handling, as well as reports from partners and victims. The list is not necessarily complete, for
example if confidentiality agreements exist at the request of victims or sources. In addition, there should
be a certain number of unreported cases, the more professional and secretive the threat actors are.
Especially in the case of advanced attackers, detection can be made more difficult and attribution to a
named threat actor can remain unclear, which means that the corresponding attacks do not appear in the
list.
Since the strategic goals and missions of threat actors change over time, the list is not static, but will be
updated depending on the BSI's assessment.

The threat actor engages in social engineering and initially
sends several emails without malicious code until the
recipient has built up trust. Only then will malicious code or
a phishing link be delivered.
