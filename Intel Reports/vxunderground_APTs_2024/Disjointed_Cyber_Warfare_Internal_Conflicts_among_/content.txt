Abstract
Our ongoing, descriptive study explores the intricacies of 
Offensive Cyber Operations (OCOs), particularly in the context of 
the Russian-Ukrainian conflict that began in 2022. This conflict has 
underscored an escalation in Russian cyber capabilities. Despite 
OCOs playing a role, academic research indicates a relatively lim­
ited ‘spillover effect’. Our study aims to investigate this limited 
spillover, focusing on the lack of collaboration among Advanced 
Persistent Threat (APT) groups associated with Russian intelligence 
agencies: GRU, SVR, and FSB. By analysing the operational and 
technical integration among these agencies, we seek to identify 
factors influencing cooperation. Preliminary findings suggest that 
internal competition and historical disparities may have hindered 
effective coordination in cyber operations. We posit that this lack 
of coordination could potentially reduce cyberattack effectiveness 
and increase detection likelihood. Importantly, we recognise that 
behavioural aspects, such as the principal-agent problem, may con­
tribute to the barriers preventing collaboration and coordination. 
These behavioural factors, alongside institutional rivalries, likely 
play a significant role in shaping the competitive dynamics among

1.  Introduction
A
ccording to Damjan Štrucl, the role of Offensive 
Cyber Operations (OCOs) in modern conflicts has 
been notably heightened by the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 
February 24, 2022. Prior analyses, drawing from precedents like 
Stuxnet and NotPetya, had projected a significant impact of cyber 
warfare, particularly through malware distribution with potential 
repercussions extending beyond the immediate conflict zone to 
affect other nations and organisations. This expectation was under­
pinned by the recognition of Russia’s formidable cyber capabilities. 
Yet, the unfolding of events presented a striking puzzle: contrary 
to widespread predictions, the Russian OCOs manifested limited 
effects on the war’s outcome. This discrepancy was highlighted 
in several assessments that questioned the anticipated dominant 
role of cyber operations in the conflict. On the one hand, forecasts 
had envisioned a scenario where cyber operations would play ­
a  pivotal role in the warfare strategy; on the other, post-event 
analy­ses and reports underscored the surprisingly marginal impact 
of these operations. This apparent paradox suggests a lack of coor­
dination among Russian intelligence agencies as a plausible expla­
nation [1]. These empirical observations introduce a theoretical 
quandary: How can coordination be managed or integrated within 
OCOs? This is a work in progress and presents an exploratory study 
into a complex theoretical challenge: understanding the dynamics 
of coordination within OCOs, particularly in the context of Russian 
intelligence agencies. The study identifies a crucial observation that 
GRU, SVR, and FSB [2] are indeed distinct entities, each operating 
with unique strategies, technologies, and protocols. This differenti­
ation is not merely organisational but extends to their approach to 
Disjointed Cyber Warfare

cyber operations. The real puzzle, as underscored by our research, 
lies in the evident challenge these organisations face in coordinat­
ing their activities effectively, despite their established distinctive­
ness. This lack of coordination presents a significant inquiry into 
why these entities, known for their respective capabilities, do not 
achieve a unified and cohesive operational front in cyber warfare. 
A key observation driving this inquiry is the apparent limited effec­
tiveness of Russian OCOs, attributed primarily to a shortfall in oper­
ational and technical integration among these agencies. This lack of 
coordination, especially among various advanced persistent threats 
(APTs), forms the central theme of our investigation. Our approach 
to exploring this issue is two-fold. Initially, we delve into the notion 
of integration at both technical and operational levels within 
intelligence agencies active in cyber defence. Subsequently, we 
empirically analyse this concept within the framework of Russia’s 
intelligence system. This analysis aims to illuminate the roles of 
internal competition and political rivalry among these agencies 
and how these factors might influence state-sponsored cyber 
threats [3]. This paper aims to contribute to the broader debate on 
state-sponsored cyber operations. By focusing on the possible rea­
sons for the observed lack of coordination among different hacking 
groups purportedly connected to Russia, the study offers insights 
into the impact of internal dynamics – such as competition and 
rivalry within the Russian government and intelligence sectors  – 
on the nature and structure of state-affiliated cyber threats. This 
perspective is novel and adds a valuable dimension to our under­
standing of state-sponsored cyber activities. In some cases, political 
rivalry can lead to a politicisation of these agencies, where officers 
or civil servants are chosen based on their political affiliation, rather 
than their qualifications or experience [4]. Such a situation can lead 
to deterioration in the quality of the agency’s services and less 
trust in government institutions by the public. Collectively, politi­
cal rivalry can create significant externalities [5] in the competition 
between public agencies, creating challenges for leaders and exec­
utive officials as they seek to deal with changing priorities while 
maintaining the integrity and effectiveness of their operations. 
In recent years, acknowledging the historical backdrop of inter-
agency rivalry in Russia, particularly between the FSB and the GRU, 
sheds light on the complexities of coordination within its intelli­
gence framework. Incidents such as GRU’s involvement in the 2014 
Crimea annexation and the handling of Sergei Skripal’s poisoning 
in 2018 have highlighted this friction, with the FSB expressing dis­
satisfaction over perceived oversteps by GRU. This longstanding 
political rivalry among Russia’s intelligence entities, including the 
SVR, prior to the 2022 Ukraine conflict, suggests that the observed

lack of coordination and integration during the war was, in retro­
spect, an anticipated outcome. Consequently, the initial expecta­
tions of a significant cyber offensive impact, akin to spillover effects 
seen in previous global cyber incidents, may have overlooked the 
practical implications of these internal dynamics, thereby contrib­
uting to the re-evaluation of the puzzle surrounding Russia’s cyber 
operations effectiveness [6]. The landscape of inter-agency compe­
tition, compounded by political rivalries, is full of challenges. This 
unstable dynamic environment can induce uncertainty and instabil­
ity, hampering operational and strategic coordination. To illustrate 
this environment, tension has been observed within the Russian 
intelligence community, particularly between the FSB and the GRU, 
due to alleged excesses of jurisdiction and operational abuse. This 
study adds to the talk of state-sponsored cyber operations by pro­
viding an explanatory lens for coordination deficiencies observed 
among hacking groups allegedly linked to Russia [7]. Furthermore, 
we seek to answer two central research questions (RQs) regarding 
the degree of integration between cyber defence agencies’ opera­
tional and technical/tactical levels and the factors contributing to 
any observed lack of integration:
•	 RQ1: To what extent does integration occur between the techni­
cal and operational divisions within intelligence agencies when 
executing government-offensive policies in cyberspace?
•	 RQ2: What factors impede the integration between technical and 
operational divisions within intelligence agencies in the imple­
mentation of government-offense strategies in cyberspace?
In doing so, we emphasise the critical role of the technical and 
operational levels within intelligence agencies. While the technical 
level focuses on the skilful use of information management tech­
nologies, the operational level primarily addresses the strategic use 
of information for immediate decision-making. These two layers, 
while distinct, often need to be closely integrated for an effective 
response to threat or opportunity. Lack of coordination can lead to 
a significant disconnect between strategic objectives and their oper­
ational execution. This disjunction often stems from the divergence 
between technical capabilities and operational planning – wherein 
the technological approaches do not align with operational plans. 
Such misalignment threatens to widen the gap between what is 
strategically decided and what is practically implemented, resulting 
in technical inefficiencies, leading to operational inefficacies [8]. Our 
research aims to illuminate these coordination challenges and pro­
pose mechanisms for greater integration within state-­sponsored 
cyber operations. Indeed, moving forward, let’s examine the 
Disjointed Cyber Warfare

potential implications of a fragmented intelligence community. It 
erodes the quality of services rendered by agencies. Furthermore, 
the well-known political competition within public agencies can 
produce significant externalities. Navigating the shifting currents 
of rivalries and evolving strategic priorities pose significant chal­
lenges for agency leaders and officers, potentially disrupting the 
effectiveness and integrity of their operations. Historical tensions 
within the Russian intelligence community have often led to strate­
gic misalignments. For example, the FSB has reportedly expressed 
dissatisfaction with GRU’s role in the 2014 annexation of Crimea, 
considering it a violation of its jurisdiction. Similarly, the handling 
of Sergei Skripal´s poisoning in 2018 is said to have intensified fric­
tion between the agencies [9]. The misalignment between strate­
gic objectives and their execution due to internal fragmentation 
can lead to operational inefficiencies and potential vulnerabilities, 
highlighting the need for better integration at technical and oper­
ational levels. We hope to contribute to the broader discourse on 
offensive state-sponsored cyber operations through this lens. The 
­methodology used to answer RQs and better understand such 
operations is multifaceted, in the following order:
•	 We conduct a literature review on cyber operations, intelligence 
agency structures, and inter-agency dynamics.
•	 We analyse open-source intelligence (OSINT) data related to 
Russian cyber activities during the Ukraine conflict.
•	 We employ a case study approach, examining the activities of 
three main Russian intelligence agencies: GRU, SVR, and FSB, 
along with their associated APTs.
•	 We analyse the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of 
specific APTs linked to these agencies, such as Sandworm, Fancy 
Bear, Cozy Bear, Turla, Callisto, and Gamaredon.
2.  The Challenges of Coordination
In the complex landscape of OCO, the effective manage­
ment of challenges heavily relies on the robust establishment of 
cooperation and coordination principles. Cooperation refers to 
sharing resources, information, or skills to achieve common goals 
or tackle shared challenges. Coordination refers to the organisa­
tion of the efforts of the various actors, aimed at ensuring the effi­
cient and effective achievement of the shared objectives. At the 
strategic level, which involves long-term planning and deci­
sion-making aimed at achieving overarching goals, cooperation is 
the key. It involves a concerted effort among various organisations 
and entities, bridging their resources and capabilities. This level of 
Cosimo Melella, Francesco Ferazza, Konstantinos Mersinas
www.acigjournal.com  –––  acig, vol. 4, no. 2, 2024  –––  doi: 10.60097/ACIG/192120
operation is crucial in conflict situations, requiring not just strong 
political determination but also a unified strategic vision to address 
broad, often long-term objectives. In contrast, coordination is criti­
cal at both operational and technical levels. The operational level 
refers to the execution of strategies, focusing on how different 
components of an organisation or entities work together to imple­
ment the strategic plan. This might involve day-to-day manage­
ment of resources, decision-making regarding specific cyber 
operations, and real-time responses to evolving situations. The 
technical level, on the other hand, delves into the specificities of 
cyber warfare, dealing with the actual tools, tactics, and procedures 
used in cyber operations. It includes hands-on tasks, such as soft­
ware development, system penetration, data analysis, and other 
technical aspects of cyber warfare. Coordination at this level 
ensures that the technical actions align with the strategic objectives 
and operational plans. It involves synchronising cyber operations, 
sharing crucial intelligence, and modifying tactics and techniques 
as needed to effectively counteract adversaries’ defensive mea­
sures or react to their coordinated activities on the battlefield. 
Understanding and integrating these levels of operation is essen­
tial in managing the dynamic and intricate nature of cyber conflicts 
and the activities of APTs. Such an integrated approach ensures 
that strategic decisions are effectively translated into operational 
success and technical precision, a critical factor in the domain of 
OCOs. Referring to what has been written about the importance of 
coordination in OCO, the academic studies of McNeil [10], 
Hernandez-Ardieta, 
Tapiador, 
Suarez-Tangil 
[11], 
Heuvel, 
Baltink  [12], and Liebetrau [13] provide further insights into this 
essentiality of coordination in cyberspace. These academic works 
reinforce the idea that to successfully face the challenges of cyber­
space and effectively manage cyber operations; it is fundamental 
to establish solid principles of cooperation at the strategic level and 
coordination at all levels: strategic, operational, and technical. 
McNeil highlights the need for strategic international cooperation, 
emphasising how its absence can limit offensive and defensive 
capabilities in cyberspace. It reflects the importance of lower-level 
coordination among nations to achieve long-term objectives. The 
article by Hernandez-Ardieta, Tapiador, and Suarez-Tangil sheds 
light on the importance of information-sharing models for coordi­
nated cyber defence, recognising the essentiality of coordination at 
the operational and technical levels to ensure alignment between 
technical actions and strategic objectives. Finally, Liebetrau, in his 
article, examines how different countries organise their cyber capa­
bilities, identifying various organisational models and emphasising 
the importance of coordination between military and intelligence 
Disjointed Cyber Warfare

entities, which is essential for addressing cyber conflicts. These 
studies emphasise that information sharing and coordination are 
crucial for improving operational capabilities and security in cyber­
space. They highlight the importance of continuous efforts to 
develop effective frameworks, agreements, and protocols, ensur­
ing that strategic decisions are translated into operational success 
and technical precision in OCOs. Coordination between different 
APTs in achieving similar or different goals depends on the goals 
set by their coordinating intelligence agencies. If the intent is to 
maximise the impact of an operation, it may be appropriate to aim 
simultaneously at the same goal [14]. Conversely, if the operation is 
aimed at stealth, cyber-espionage, or evasion of detection, it is 
more appropriate to target different targets simultaneously [15]. 
Mandiant, which has been monitoring cyber threat intelligence 
activities in various Ukrainian organisations since the beginning of 
the conflict, has reported incidents where the detection of one 
APT’s operation led to the discovery of another APT’s activities. It 
occurs due to data collected by Security Information and Event 
Management (SIEM) systems that identify specific TTPs linked to 
one or more threat actors. Additionally, coordination between APTs 
can be challenging, as it requires high trust and synergy between 
sponsoring organisations. This increased interaction can increase 
the risk of exposure and compromise, negatively affecting the oper­
ation’s success. The coordination between APTs and the achieve­
ment of similar or different objectives will depend on ­several 
factors, including the operation’s objectives, the resources avail­
able to the sponsoring organisations, and the target infrastruc­
ture’s security posture [16]. A case in point of this scenario is the 
Democratic National Committee (DNC) hack in 2016, which involved 
two separate Russian hacker groups: APT28, affiliated with the GRU, 
and APT29, linked to the SVR. This cyber breach was notable for its 
sophistication and volume of sensitive data stolen, including emails 
and other DNC documents [17]. While APT28 and APT29 are com­
monly believed to have coordinated the hack, evidence suggests 
they still needed to synchronise their efforts. For example, APT28 
used a spear phishing campaign to access the DNC’s email system, 
while APT29 used a different method involving a compromised 
VPN. Furthermore, the tools and TTPs used by the two groups var­
ied, indicating a target-based fit. For example, APT28 reportedly 
used X-Agent for data exfiltration, while APT29 used a different tool, 
SeaDaddy. Despite the lack of coordination, APT28 and APT29 suc­
cessfully executed a cyberattack on the DNC. However, this lack of 
coordination may have led to overlooked opportunities or ineffi­
ciencies [18]. In recent decades, and before the invasion of Ukraine, 
Russia has leveraged sophisticated cyber capabilities to conduct 
Cosimo Melella, Francesco Ferazza, Konstantinos Mersinas

global disinformation campaigns, propaganda, espionage, and 
destructive cyberattacks. Russia oversees numerous units that 
carry out these operations under various security and intelligence 
agencies. These Russian security agencies often compete and con­
duct parallel operations on the same targets, complicating specific 
attribution assessments. Over the past two decades, Russia has 
expanded the staffing of its security agencies, thereby developing 
extensive capabilities to undertake a wide range of cyber opera­
tions. No single Russian security or intelligence agency holds sole 
responsibility for cyber operations. Instead, three agencies share 
this role: GRU, SVR, and FSB [19]. The distribution of responsibilities 
between GRU, SVR, and FSB can sometimes lead to overlapping or 
conflicting operations. Each of these agencies maintains its infor­
mation units and strategic goals, which reflect the broader goals of 
their parent organisations. The GRU is traditionally associated with 
military intelligence and has been implicated in numerous cyber 
operations to disrupt or destabilise foreign infrastructure. It 
includes the DNC hack attributed to APT28, which was aligned with 
the GRU’s more aggressive operational stance. Meanwhile, the SVR 
focuses on traditional espionage and foreign intelligence gather­
ing. SVR-related cyber operations, such as those attributed to the 
APT29, usually reflect this goal, targeting foreign governments, 
organisations, and individuals for intelligence gathering, rather 
than disruption. Finally, the FSB, primarily an internal security 
agency, is also involved in cyber operations. These operations often 
have a more defensive slant, focusing on internal security, counter-­
intelligence, and maintaining control over Russia’s information 
space. However, the FSB has also been associated with OCOs, par­
ticularly those targeting dissidents, activists, and other alleged 
threats to Putin’s government. The division of cyber responsibilities 
among these agencies reflects Russia’s cyber strategy’s complex 
and multifaceted nature. However, as has been noted, this division 
can lead to inefficiencies and missed opportunities due to a lack of 
coordination. For example, the different methods and tools used by 
APT28 and APT29 in the DNC hack could have allowed for a more 
thorough or effective operation if there had been more collabora­
tion between the two groups. While there is no indication that the 
GRU, SVR, or FSB will have sole responsibility for these operations, 
there may be increased efforts to coordinate and streamline activi­
ties between these agencies. It could lead to a more unified and 
powerful Russian cyber threat. However, the inherent challenges of 
coordinating between large and complex organisations with differ­
ing goals and operating cultures should not be underesti­
mated [20]. A brief graphical representation of this section is shown 
in Figure 1.

3.  Factors Impacting Coordination
Coordination between technical and operational layers in 
cyberspace faces several challenges affecting the efficiency, secu­
rity, and reliability of communication and collaboration. Firstly, 
different systems, platforms, and protocols can make seamless 
communication and coordination difficult. Ensuring interoperability 
between various devices, applications, and networks so that they 
work together requires standardisation, implementing standard 
Cosimo Melella, Francesco Ferazza, Konstantinos Mersinas
www.acigjournal.com  –––  acig, vol. 4, no. 2, 2024  –––  doi: 10.60097/ACIG/192120
protocols and constant updating. Communication delays can hin­
der real-time coordination, especially in cases where an immediate 
response is needed. Latency, an additional factor, can be caused 
by network congestion, physical distance, or routing inefficiencies. 
Finally, scalability also has a direct effect. As the number of devices, 
users, and systems involved in cyberspace increases, ensuring that 
the infrastructure of one or more agencies can handle this growth 
becomes a challenge. Scalability issues can lead to degraded per­
formance or even system failure [21]. Furthermore, for the above 
reasons, coordination fails between intelligence agencies in cyber­
space (for offensive or defensive purposes [22]). The lack of coor­
dination between the operational and technical/tactical layers 
of these organisations can make it more challenging to carry out 
attacks with a destructive effect. The lack of coordination between 
operational and strategic levels among cyber threat groups can 
lead to counterproductive outcomes, significantly hampering their 
collective effectiveness. When these layers fail to share information 
and align their efforts, they risk not only diminishing the impact of 
their operations but also increasing the likelihood of detection by 
cyber security defences. This misalignment can result in operational 
redundancies, conflicting actions, undermining the overarching 
objectives of the cyber campaign. To enhance operational security 
and effectiveness, establishing robust communication channels 
and coordination mechanisms is essential, ensuring that all actions 
are synergistic and strategically aligned. Cultural and historical dif­
ferences between these agencies hinder effective communication 
and coordination in cyberspace. Added to this are confidentiality 
issues: the need to balance security and privacy with the ability 
to coordinate and share information creates technical limitations. 
This competition creates disjointed efforts, undermining the effi­
ciency of cyberattacks. Intelligence agencies, rather than pursuing 
large-scale destructive attacks through their units, have preferred 
to use their APTs mainly for cyber-espionage purposes, some­
times trying to integrate the cybernetic plan with the kinetic one 
to achieve their operational goals [23]. Cyber operations conducted 
by different intelligence agencies involve a complex set of techni­
cal and operational layers working together. The technical level 
typically involves using advanced technologies, such as malware, 
remote access tools, and other sophisticated hacking techniques, 
to gain unauthorised access to targeted computer systems and 
networks [24]. Especially, cyber espionage operations conducted 
by different intelligence agencies involve a complex set of tech­
nical and operational layers working together. The technical level 
typically involves using advanced technologies, such as malware, 
remote access tools, and other sophisticated hacking techniques, 
Disjointed Cyber Warfare
www.acigjournal.com  –––  acig, vol. 4, no. 2, 2024  –––  doi: 10.60097/ACIG/192120
to gain unauthorised access to targeted computer systems and 
networks. The operational level, on the other hand, encompasses 
the ­execution of the operations themselves. This level involves 
identifying and prioritising targets, choosing appropriate methods 
of attack, and coordinating the actions of operators engaged in the 
operation. To effectively integrate the technical and operational lev­
els, an intelligence agency typically employs highly trained agents 
trained to understand cyber espionage’s technical and operational 
aspects. These operators work together in a coordinated way to 
develop and execute complex attacks on targeted systems and net­
works [25]. On a technical level, the operators use various tools and 
techniques to gain unauthorised access to the target’s computer 
systems and networks. It can involve exploiting vulnerabilities in 
software, using phishing attacks to trick users into giving up their 
login credentials or using social engineering techniques to gain 
access to sensitive information. Once access is gained, agents can 
use various information-gathering tools, such as key logging soft­
ware, to capture passwords and other sensitive information or mal­
ware to monitor the target’s activities and communications [26]. At 
the operational level, operators use their understanding of target 
motivations and behaviour to leverage the information gathered 
to deploy attack tactics. For example, they can use the information 
to influence the target´s decisions or to gather more information 
about other targets. Successful cyber espionage operations require 
high technical and tactical sophistication and a deep understand­
ing of the target’s motivations, behaviours, and vulnerabilities. The 
integration of technical and operational levels is essential for the 
success of these operations and requires a high degree of skill and 
coordination between the operators involved.
4.  Objectives, Skills, and Culture as 
Coordination Challenges
While intra-agency coordination remains achievable 
despite challenges in melding technical and operational levels, 
inter-agency collaboration presents a more complex scenario due 
to divergent organisational cultures, conflicting priorities, infra­
structural disjunctions, and varying degrees of technical and oper­
ational expertise. These dynamics underscore the need for refined 
RQs that capture both internal and external integration facets 
within intelligence agencies’ cyber operations. Thus, we propose an 
updated framing of RQs: 
•	 RQ1: To what extent does integration occur between the technical 
and operational divisions within intelligence agencies, specifically 
Cosimo Melella, Francesco Ferazza, Konstantinos Mersinas
www.acigjournal.com  –––  acig, vol. 4, no. 2, 2024  –––  doi: 10.60097/ACIG/192120
when executing government-offensive policies in cyberspace? 
This question aims to explore the depth and effectiveness of 
internal coordination efforts, shedding light on the synergy 
between technological innovations and operational strategies. 
•	 RQ2: What factors impede the integration between technical and 
operational divisions within intelligence agencies, particularly 
in the context of implementing government-defensive strate­
gies in cyberspace? This inquiry seeks to identify and analyse 
the barriers to effective collaboration, focusing on the internal 
dynamics that challenge the alignment of cyber defence objec­
tives with operational execution. These updated questions aim 
to provide a comprehensive understanding of both internal inte­
gration within agencies and complexities of inter-agency coop­
eration, reflecting the multifaceted nature of cyber operations 
in the intelligence community [27]. A key challenge is that differ­
ent intelligence agencies may have different goals and priorities. 
For example, one agency might focus on gathering information 
about a particular target, while another might be more interested 
in disrupting the target’s activities or using intelligence to influ­
ence decisions [28]. These differing priorities can make it difficult 
to coordinate operations effectively, as each agency may have 
a different approach to intelligence collection and use. In some 
cases, agencies may even have conflicting goals, such as when 
two agencies are interested in a particular target audience but 
have different goals and modus operandi on how to approach the 
task [29]. Another challenge is that different agencies may have 
different technical and operational expertise levels. For example, 
one agency may be more proficient at developing and executing 
complex cyberattacks. At the same time, another may have skill 
sets for gathering information from various sources and deploy­
ing psychological operations [30].
5.  The Principal-Agent Dynamic
Furthermore, there may be a disruption in the principal-­
agent dynamic between the technical/tactical and operational 
levels between APTs working for different intelligence agencies 
and the decision-makers who deal with high-level coordination 
­activities. The ‘principal-agent problem’ in economics models the 
situation where one or more ‘agents’ operate on behalf of the ‘prin­
cipal’ who has hierarchical dominance over the agents. This rela­
tionship involves information asymmetries, since the agents usually 
have access to more information than the principal, and conflicts 
of interest, since agents might not operate in accordance with the 
principal’s benefit. Principals cannot monitor closely the actions

of the agents, and agents have motivations which might not serve 
the principal’s goals. In our case, conflicts can arise by a need for 
more understanding: actors with technical expertise working within 
groups may need to understand decision-makers’ broader goals 
and strategies clearly. On the other hand, decision-makers may 
need help for understanding the technicalities. Furthermore, this is 
why decision-makers (at the strategic level) and those who execute 
these decisions (at the operational level), both essential elements 
of tactical planning, need to spend more time identifying and pri­
oritising their goals. The problem of information sharing in this 
context is aggravating: intelligence agencies (acting as ‘agents’) 
have access to more information and are often reluctant to share 
this information with those working at the coordination level (the 
­‘principals’) or with other engineers from different entities, result­
ing in a lack of coordination and collaboration. Intelligence agencies 
may be reluctant to share information for various reasons, such as 
protecting sources. Disclosure of this information could put these 
sources or specific operations at risk. Similarly, agencies may want 
to protect the specific methods by which they conduct operations 
and collect information. If these techniques become public knowl­
edge, they may become less effective. These bodies may want to 
maintain control over the information they collect to ensure it is 
used appropriately and to have a bargaining edge when influenc­
ing political decisions. Additionally, there may be some resistance 
to information sharing if agencies feel they need more ­recognition 
for their work or are concerned that other agencies may use the 
information to advance their interests at their own expense. These 
problems can lead to hampering the overall effectiveness of the 
intelligence system. Moreover, the principals, that is, the agency-­
coordinating entities at the higher level, do not necessarily share 
their broader strategy with the agents, that is, the agencies. Thus, 
in lack of a ‘broader picture’ (another information asymmetry), 
the aforementioned factors and coordinating challenges can be 
maintained and perpetuated. Even in the case of minimisation of 
information asymmetries, the historical analysis of the agencies 
under examination reveals an often competitive stance amongst 
the agencies. Whether this is a deliberately cultivated environment 
from senior leadership or a phenomenon that has evolved organ­
ically amongst the agencies can be debatable. But, in either way, 
such an environment maintains the aforementioned challenges. 
These differences in expertise and access to information can make 
it difficult to coordinate operations effectively, as agencies may 
need to fully understand each other’s capabilities, limitations, and 
motivations. This setting can lead to misunderstandings or commu­
nication problems, compromising operational success. In summary,

the principal-agent dynamic highlights significant coordination and 
information-sharing challenges within and between intelligence 
agencies operating APTs. These challenges stem from informa­
tion asymmetries and conflicting interests, where technical teams 
may lack insight into broader strategic goals and decision-makers 
may not grasp operational technicalities. Such disparities hinder 
effective cooperation and can compromise operational success. 
Overcoming these obstacles requires improved communication, 
mutual understanding of goals and methodologies, and a commit­
ment to aligning actions with overarching strategic objectives.
6.  Cultural Differences
Different organisational cultures exhibit varying behaviours 
and approaches; these differences might make it difficult for different 
intelligence agencies to work together effectively. There are several 
studies on the effects of cultural characteristics. Empirical research 
identifies a number of cultural dimensions to describe a national or 
regional culture. Such dimensions can be equally applied to organi­
sations, and, for our purposes, can indicate how differences in these 
dimensions can impair coordination between them. While there 
are many of these dimensions, proposed by different research­
ers  [31,  32], we focus on a selected subset, that is, the ones that 
are likely to have the highest impact on the coordination between 
the examined agencies. For our purposes, we consider intelligence 
agencies as entities which have their own characteristics, that is, they 
have measurable ‘scores’ across the following dimensions. One of 
the most relevant dimensions, in this sense, is that which describes 
how trust is gained, for trust is a pivotal aspect of highly confiden­
tial environments. Different organisational cultures might have dif­
ferent ways to attribute trust, and coordinating groups where trust 
is gained in different ways can be tricky. For example, one group 
might find higher trust value in personal relations, such as simply 
having attended the same military academy (relationship-based 
trust), while the other group might find higher trust in performance, 
or a  long successful career with achievements (task-based trust). 
Another important cultural aspect is that of leadership; some organ­
isations might be more hierarchically structured, with strict and 
well-defined vertically ordered ranks, while others might have more 
loose, egalitarian structures which reach decisions via consensus. 
The degree of uncertainty avoidance that an organisation can toler­
ate is also a very important dimension. Some organisations require 
everything to be normed, and deviation from these norms is often a 
cause of ‘neuroticism’, conflict, and confusion. Other organisations 
might be more flexible, being less focused on inflexible principles, 
Disjointed Cyber Warfare
www.acigjournal.com  –––  acig, vol. 4, no. 2, 2024  –––  doi: 10.60097/ACIG/192120
and more open to opportunity and change. Last, but not least, 
another relevant cultural aspect is that of decision-making; some 
organisations might favour a top-down approach, where leading 
individuals make decisions and impose these to subordinates, while 
others take a consensus-based approach. In the light of the above, it 
appears that motivations and access to information of agency enti­
ties in the form of principal-agent dynamics, or cultural differences 
between agencies, can amplify or diminish coordination challenges 
between agencies. In the next section, we present the case stud­
ies of GRU, SVR, and FSB, along with their indicative corresponding 
APTs. The choice to focus on GRU, SVR, and FSB agencies for the 
case study portion of our OCO study was driven by several signifi­
cant factors. Firstly, the context of the recent Russian-Ukrainian con­
flict at the centre of this paper, which has seen a marked increase 
in Russian cyber capabilities, makes these agencies particularly rele­
vant. The GRU, SVR, and FSB have been protagonists in various cyber 
operations in this context. These agencies have distinct but comple­
mentary roles in intelligence and cyber operations. The GRU deals 
primarily with military intelligence, the SVR with foreign intelligence, 
and the FSB with internal security and counter-intelligence. By ana­
lysing the interactions between these agencies, we can gain greater 
insight into Russia’s internal dynamics in cyber operations. Another 
critical aspect is the historic competition and disparities between 
these agencies. These internal differences offer a rich context for 
exploring how they influence coordination and effectiveness in cyber 
operations. Understanding the causes of their lack of coordination 
can reveal key factors that hinder or facilitate greater cooperation. 
Furthermore, our analysis focuses on the impact of this lack of coor­
dination on the effectiveness of cyber operations. If these agencies 
fail to coordinate effectively, this could reduce the impact of their 
cyberattacks and increase the likelihood of detection. By examining 
interactions at operational and technical levels, our study seeks to 
identify ways to improve the overall effectiveness of cyber opera­
tions. Through this study, we intend to deeply explore the competi­
tive and historical dynamics of Russian intelligence agencies, which 
are crucial to a comprehensive understanding of the broader land­
scape of cyber operations. In the following sections we add succinct, 
top-level descriptions of TTPs employed by the analysed APTs, for 
they serve as valuable tools in understanding their behaviour and 
modus operandi.

several significant factors. Firstly, the context of the recent Russian-
Ukrainian conflict at the centre of this paper, which has seen 
a marked increase in Russian cyber capabilities, makes these agen­
cies particularly relevant. The GRU, SVR, and FSB have been protag­
onists in various cyber operations in this context. These agencies 
have distinct but complementary roles in intelligence and cyber 
operations. The GRU deals primarily with military intelligence, the 
SVR with foreign intelligence, and the FSB with internal security 
and counter-intelligence. By analysing the interactions between 
these agencies, we can gain greater insight into Russia’s internal 
dynamics in cyber operations. Another critical aspect is the historic 
competition and disparities between these agencies. These inter­
nal differences offer a rich context for exploring how they influence 
coordination and effectiveness in cyber operations. Furthermore, 
our analysis focuses on the impact of this lack of coordination on 
the effectiveness of cyber operations. If these agencies fail to coor­
dinate effectively, this could reduce the impact of their cyberattacks 
and increase the likelihood of detection. By examining interactions 
at operational and technical levels, our study seeks to identify ways 
to improve the overall effectiveness of cyber operations. Through 
this study, we intend to deeply explore the competitive and histor­
ical dynamics of Russian intelligence agencies, which are crucial to 
a comprehensive understanding of the broader landscape of cyber 
operations. In the following sections we add succinct, top-level 
descriptions of TTPs employed by the analysed APTs, for they serve 
as valuable tools in understanding their behaviour and modus 
operandi.
7.1.  GRU
The Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed 
Forces of the Russian Federation, commonly called the GRU, is 
Russia’s military intelligence agency. The GRU has been implicated 
in some of the best-known cyber operations, and the public profile 
of the units underscores a high operational pace. The GRU would 
also control several research institutes tasked with developing new 
malware. Over the years, researchers and analysts have noted an 
apparent willingness on the part of GRU computer units to con­
duct aggressive espionage operations, sometimes with question­
able operational security and secrecy levels [33]. In particular, Unit 
26165, to which, APTs, such as Fancy Bear and Sandworm, are linked, 
is one of the two Russian groups identified by the US government 
as responsible for hacking the DNC during the Clinton–Trump pres­
idential campaign. Western governments and media have linked 
Unit 26165 to numerous offensive operations against public and 
Disjointed Cyber Warfare
www.acigjournal.com  –––  acig, vol. 4, no. 2, 2024  –––  doi: 10.60097/ACIG/192120
private sector targets in the United States and Europe [34]. Then 
there is Unit 74455, which is linked to some of Russia’s most brazen 
and damaging cyberattacks. Unit 74455 was identified as respon­
sible for the coordinated release of stolen emails and documents 
during the 2016 US presidential election [35]. Focusing primarily on 
systems penetration and intelligence gathering, Unit 74455 appears 
to have a significant offensive cyber capability, including develop­
ing NotPetya malware that hit multiple targets in Ukraine in June 
2017, then spread globally and caused significant damage outside 
Ukraine [36]. Finally, there is Unit 54777, also known as the 72nd 
Special Service Center, which would be responsible for GRU psycho­
logical operations, including online disinformation campaigns [37].
(1) Sandworm: While Sandworm is not Kremlin’s most prominent 
hacker group, it is the most visible one since the beginning of the 
war, and its track record of successful attacks with global impact, 
most notably the NotPetya malware and several attacks on Ukraine 
have made it a severe concern for the Computer Emergency 
Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA). In 2017, the group used 
Wiper NotPetya malware disguised as ransomware to take down 
hundreds of networks between Ukrainian government agencies, 
banks, hospitals, and airports, causing an estimated $10 billion in 
global damage. By presenting destructive attacks as ransomware, 
Sandworm would be able to cover its tracks and make it more dif­
ficult for researchers to attribute the attacks to a state-sponsored 
group. Since the beginning of the war, Sandworm has relent­
lessly targeted Ukraine with various malware strains. Some were 
highly sophisticated, while others exploited known vulnerabili­
ties that made them easier to detect and prevent from spreading. 
Researchers believe Sandworm experimented with malware strains 
to bypass Ukraine’s best defences. Most of the attacks were neu­
tralised in the early stages, and the second blackout researchers 
expected from Sandworm after targeting Ukraine’s power supply 
in 2015 and 2016 never occurred [38]. In April 2022, Sandworm 
attempted to take down a large energy supplier in Ukraine using 
a new iteration of the ‘Industroyer’ malware dubbed ‘Industroyer2’ 
just for ICS systems, as well as a new version of the ‘CaddyWiper’ 
malware to destroy data of the organisations affected. According to 
reports, Industroyer2 has been customised to target high-voltage 
power substations and then use CaddyWiper and other malware 
for data wiping (e.g. OrcShred, Soloshred, and Awfulshred for Linux 
and Solaris systems) and then wipe any trace of the attack [39]. It is 
still unknown exactly how Sandworm compromised the energy sup­
plier’s environment or how it moved from the IT network, accord­
ing to researchers at the computer company ESET, who worked 
Cosimo Melella, Francesco Ferazza, Konstantinos Mersinas

with CERT-UA to secure the network to the ICS environment. ESET 
strongly believes that Industroyer2 was created using the source 
code of Industroyer, exploited by Sandworm in 2016 to shut down 
power in Ukraine. According to CERT-UA and ESET, Sandworm 
planned to initiate the final phase of this attack by distributing the 
malware on April 8, 2022 on Azure servers and automated Windows 
workstations, Linux servers running OrcShred and AwfulShred, 
high voltage power substations and active network equip­
ment. CERT-UA points out, however, that the implementation of 
Sandworm’s evil plan has so far been prevented, thanks to efficient 
operational detection and incident response planning. ESET also 
noted in a technical report on the malware used in the attack that 
‘Sandworm allegedly attempted to distribute Industroyer2 malware 
against high-voltage power substations in Ukraine’. ESET research­
ers further report that Industroyer2 is configurable and includes 
detailed hardcoded configuration, which requires it to be recom­
piled for each new target. ESET points out, however, that given that 
the Industroyer malware family has only been deployed twice, with 
a 5-year gap between each release, Sandworm operators still need 
to develop different versions. The malware sample shows function­
ality similar to Industroyer’s IEC-104 module, primarily a protocol 
used in Europe and the Middle East for TCP communications within 
electrical systems. There are conflicting reports about the impact of 
this operation. While the full impact remains to be seen, this opera­
tion serves as a reminder of Russia’s capabilities to cut off electric­
ity in different parts of Ukraine and its readiness to employ them. 
This activity poses a higher risk to Ukraine’s electricity transmission 
and distribution services [40]. Sandworm is also allegedly respon­
sible for a new round of ransomware attacks hitting targets across 
Ukraine with the new variant of the .NET RansomBoggs ransom­
ware. Also, ESET, in a series of tweets about ransomware attacks, 
claims to have informed CERT-UA of a variant of RansomBoggs that 
it spotted, as the ransomware targeted several local organisations. 
Reports indicate that the exploited .NET malware is new and dis­
tributed similarly to previous campaigns linked to GRU. The ransom 
note (SullivanDecryptsYourFiles[.]txt) shows the authors imper­
sonating James P. Sullivan, one of the main characters in the Pixar 
film Monsters & Co. The executable file is also called Sullivan[.]exe. 
There are similarities to previous Sandworm attacks: a PowerShell 
script used to distribute .NET ransomware from the domain con­
troller is nearly identical to the one seen last April during the 
Industroyer2 attack s against the energy sector, ESET research­
ers explain. The PowerShell script used, which CERT-UA dubbed 
‘PowerGap’, was also used to distribute the ‘CaddyWiper’ malware 
alongside Industroyer2 using the ‘ArguePatch’ loader [41]. ESET 
Disjointed Cyber Warfare

also says the operation resembles a ransomware campaign con­
ducted in October 2022 that targeted Ukrainian and Polish logistics 
companies with the ‘Prestige’ variant. The ransomware’s activity 
targeting Ukrainian organisations named RansomBoggs has not 
been directly observed. However, the PowerShell script used to 
distribute the .NET ransomware known as POWERGAP is tracked. 
This script can enumerate Group Policy Objects using the Active 
Directory service interface, in line with other recent activity involv­
ing NEARMISS, CADDYWIPER, and JUNKMAIL, all delivered via GPO. 
In particular, the activity that exploits these tools together with 
POWERGAP is attributed – at the time of writing – to APT28 too, 
which, like Sandworm, would be under the control of GRU [42].
(2) Fancy Bear: The cyber espionage activity of Fancy Bear, also 
known as APT28, Strontium, or Sofacy, has mainly targeted enti­
ties in the United States, Europe, and the countries of the former 
Soviet Union, including governments and armed forces, the media, 
and dissidents at the present Russian government. In recent years, 
Russia appears to have been using APT28 increasingly to conduct 
intelligence operations commensurate with broader strategic 
military doctrine. APT28 uses the same pattern to hit its victims: 
after compromising a victim organisation, APT28 steals sensitive 
data, whichis then leaked for other political narratives aligned with 
Russian interests [43]. These have included the conflict in Syria, 
NATO–Ukraine relations, the European Union (EU) refugee and 
migrant crisis, and the 2016 US presidential election [44]. Since 
2014, APT28´s online activity has likely supported intelligence 
operations designed to influence the domestic politics of foreign 
nations. These operations have involved taking down and defac­
ing websites, false flag operations using fake hacktivists, and 
data theft later publicly disclosed online. APT28 is also respon­
sible for the attack on the DNC and other entities related to the 
2016 US presidential election cycle. These breaches involved the 
theft of internal data, primarily emails, which were later strategi­
cally leaked through multiple forums and calculatedly propagated, 
almost certainly intended to further particular objectives of the 
Russian government [45]. In a report published on January 7, 2017, 
the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence(ODNI) [46] 
described this activity as an ‘influence campaign’. This influence 
campaign – a combination of network compromises and subse­
quent data leaks – aligns closely with the Russian military´s pub­
licly stated intentions and capabilities. Influence operations, also 
often called information operations, have a long history of inclu­
sion in the Russian strategic doctrine and have been intention­
ally developed, deployed, and modernised through the so-called

Gerasimov doctrine with the advent of the Internet. APT28 is 
believed to have played a significant role in the ongoing conflict in 
Ukraine, mainly through its cyber operations. The group has been 
linked to several cyberattacks against the Ukrainian government, 
including military targets and critical infrastructure, as well as dis­
information campaigns designed to influence public opinion in the 
country [35]. APT28, as early as January 14, 2022, a month before 
the invasion, reported that the Google Threat Analysis Group 
(TAG) would have been the proponent of a phishing campaign 
focused on Ukraine. On March 16, 2022, CERT-UA issued an alert 
highlighting that UAC-0028, the name CERT-UA gave APT28, was 
phishing UkrNet accounts. On March 4, 2022, Microsoft reported 
that it also noticed that the government network in Vinnytsia, 
a  city in west-central Ukraine, was compromised by APT28 
through a vicious spear phishing campaign targeting Ukrainian 
military and Ukrainian government personnel in the region. On 
May 3, 2022, Fancy Bear was then observed targeting its victims 
with a  new variant of infostealer malware, distributed via email 
attachments, while on May 6, 2022, CERT-UA issued a new alert on 
another campaign by ’APT, which allegedly sent malicious emails 
posing as the CERT-UA, containing an attachment in the form of 
a password protected RAR archive ‘UkrScanner.rar’ and inside the 
RAR file, a self-extracting archive (SFX) containing a malware called 
CredoMap. The data collected by the malware was exfiltrated via 
HTTPPOST requests to *.m.pipedream[.]nethostnames [47]. In 
particular, the CERT-UA warned that Sandworm, also linked to 
the Russian government, would collaborate with APT28 in these 
months of the conflict to target and actively exploit the vulnera­
bility known as ‘Follina’ in Microsoft Windows Support Diagnostic 
Tool (MSDT) (CVE-2022-30190) in malspam attacks. According to 
CERT-UA, the malspam messages use subject lines, such as ‘LIST 
of links to interactive maps’ within a malicious Word document 
(e.g. LIST_of_links_in_interactive_maps[.]docx) and have already 
reached more than 500 recipients. The CERT-UA advisory reads 
that attackers continue to exploit the CVE-2022-30190 vulnerability 
and increasingly resort to emails from compromised government-­
domain emails. Ukrainian government experts have traced this 
activity to UAC-0113, a threat actor they say with medium confi­
dence is associated with  Sandworm. In reality, Mandiant keeps 
track of the activity reported publicly as UAC-0113 and believes, it 
is UNC3666, an undefined persistent threat which might be asso­
ciated with APT28, with moderate confidence, and which serves 
explicitly to carry out everyday coordination activities between the 
two APTs for attacking the same targets. UNC3666 has likely tar­
geted Ukrainian organisations as early as December 2021 [48].

7.2.  SVR
The Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) is Russia’s princi­
pal civilian intelligence agency for foreign countries. Its task is to 
collect information using Human Intelligence (HUMINT), Signal 
Intelligence (SIGINT), and Cyber Intelligence (CYBINT) methods.1 
Most analysts conclude that SVR operates forcefully, emphasis­
ing secrecy and detection avoidance [49]. Most cyber operations 
related to the SVR focus on intelligence gathering [50]. The SVR has 
high technical expertise, often trying to achieve and maintain per­
sistence within compromised networks. Some computer analysts 
refer to SVR hackers as Cozy Bear or Turla [45].
(1) Cozy Bear: Cozy Bear, also known as APT 29, CozyDuke, the Dukes 
or PowerDukes, is a threat actor which has been active much earlier 
than the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, and is shown to have strong ties 
with the SVR since 2008. APT29 is also known to have been, together 
with APT28, involved in the US Democratic National Committee 
compromise in 2015. Following the 2016 US presidential election, 
APT29 was found responsible for spear-phishing campaigns target­
ing US-based governmental and non-governmental organisations 
(NGOs). The phishing emails were sent to defence, national security, 
international affairs, and law enforcement personnel. Some of the 
emails even pretended to originate from the Clinton Foundation to 
share election analysis. APT29 has continued to evolve and improve, 
showcasing new TTPs. Undoubtedly, APT29 has quite a diverse 
toolkit of custom-developed tools that continually improves as 
new information is published to the infosec community. This set of 
tools mainly focuses on gaining permanent access to the victim’s 
machine through backdoors and harvesting information, files, cre­
dentials, etc. and their exfiltration. APT29 used a wide range of dif­
ferent programming languages to develop its malware, from pure 
Assembly (present in some components of the MiniDuke malware) 
to C++(CozyDuke) and from C#, VisualBasic .NET (HammerDuke and 
RegDuke) to Python (SeaDuke). The group’s creativity goes even 
further, as they customise and try different technologies, infection 
vectors, infrastructures, and more  [51]. In summary, APT29 rep­
resents a dangerous advanced persistent threat. The group is tech­
nically skilled and capable of adapting to the defences of its chosen 
targets. It often uses techniques and tools that have been identi­
fied in previous attacks. The ‘fingerprints’ of its attack activity are 
becoming well documented and the subject of considerable ongo­
ing scrutiny [52]. Against the backdrop of the war in Ukraine, APT29 
is exploiting a ‘lesser-known’ Windows feature called Credential 
Roaming following a successful phishing attack against a European 
diplomatic entity. The diplomacy-focused targeting is consistent

with Russian strategic priorities and APT29’s historic targeting, as 
reported by Mandiant researcher Thibault Van Geluwe de Berlaere. 
APT29 is known for its intrusions aimed at gathering information in 
line with the strategic objectives of SVR [53]. Some of the collective’s 
cyber activities are publicly monitored under the Nobelium moniker, 
a threat cluster responsible for widespread supply chain compro­
mise through SolarWinds software in December 2020. Google said, 
it identified the use of Credential Roaming during the period APT29 
was present within the victim’s network in early 2022. Then, ‘several 
LDAP queries with atypical properties’ were executed against the 
Active Directory system. Introduced in Windows Server 2003 Service 
Pack 1 (SP1), Credential Roaming allows users to access their cre­
dentials securely on different workstations in a Windows domain. 
According to Microsoft, Credential Roaming stores user credentials 
in ms-PKI-DPAPIMasterKeys and ms-PKI-AccountCredentials in the 
user object. The latter is a multi-valued LDAP property containing 
a sizable binary object (BLOB) containing data and encrypted cre­
dentials. According to the TAG group, one of the LDAP attributes 
queried by APT29 concerned ms-PKI-Credential-Roaming-Tokens, 
which manages blob storage of encrypted user credential tokens 
for roaming [54].
(2) Turla: Turla, also known as Snake, Uroburos, Venomous Bear, 
or Waterbug, is the other group that, together with APT29, has 
links to the SVR, although, it is noteworthy that Microsoft places it 
within a cluster of known threats linked to FSB. Since at least 2007, 
this threat actor has allegedly been responsible for high-profile 
cyberattacks and espionage campaigns against government, mil­
itary and diplomatic entities, research and defence organisations 
in Ukraine, and several NATO states. Turla is also known for its 
sophisticated and stealthy techniques, often using custom malware 
and advanced tools to infiltrate its targets’ networks and remain 
undetected for long periods. Over the years, the collective has 
been involved in several high-profile cyber espionage campaigns, 
including campaigns in the United States, Europe, and the Middle 
East  [55]. Some of the unique tools and malware used by Turla 
include the following: 
Snake/Uroburos: A highly sophisticated root kit used for espionage 
and data exfiltration, capable of infecting both 32-bit and 64-bit 
­systems. It is designed to run on infected systems for extended 
periods undetected.
KopiLuwak: A Javascript-based malware used in targeted attacks, 
which can perform various tasks, such as downloading and 
Disjointed Cyber Warfare
www.acigjournal.com  –––  acig, vol. 4, no. 2, 2024  –––  doi: 10.60097/ACIG/192120
executing additional payloads, communicating with specific com­
mand and control (C2) servers, and data exfiltration. 
EpicTurla (also known as Wipbot or Tavdig): A modular backdoor that 
provides remote access to compromised systems and has been 
used in cyber-espionage campaigns since at least 2012 [56]. In 
a year of conflict, Turla was observed exploiting vulnerabilities in 
the systems of critical Ukrainian organisations and infrastructures 
with malware developed over a decade earlier to deliver reconnais­
sance tools and backdoors to specific targets in Ukraine. Mandiant, 
who has been monitoring APT’s various operations since the begin­
ning of the war, said that the malware used corresponds to a vari­
ant of a malware called ANDROMEDA (aka Gamarue), uploaded to 
VirusTotal back in 2013. Since the start of the Russian military inva­
sion of Ukraine in February 2022, the collective was allegedly linked 
to a series of phishing and credential reconnaissance activities tar­
geting various entities in the country. Among the incidents analysed 
by Mandiant, in one, an infected USB stick was used in a Ukrainian 
organisation as early as December 2021, leading, once inserted into 
the systems, to the distribution of ANDROMEDA on different hosts, 
thanks to the launch of a malicious link (.LNK) masquerading as 
a folder inside the USB drive [57]. The threat actor then repurposed 
one of the dormant domains of ANDROMEDA’s defunct C2 infra­
structure – re-registering the domain in January 2022 – to profile 
the victim by launching the KOPILUWAK dropper. Two days later, on 
September 8, 2022, the attack moved to its final stage with the exe­
cution of a .NET-based implant called QUIETCANARY (aka Tunnus), 
resulting in the exfiltration of all files created after January 1, 2021. 
Mandiant also allegedly identified a spyware application for Android 
masquerading as a ‘Process Manager’ service to stealthily steal 
sensitive information stored on infected devices. Interestingly, this 
app – has the package name ‘com.remote.app’ – establishes contact 
with a remote command and control server, 82.146.35[.]240, which 
has been identified as infrastructure belonging to Turla. When the 
application runs, a warning about the permissions granted to the 
application is displayed. Permissions include screen lock and unlock 
attempts, global device proxy settings, screen lock password expi­
ration settings, storage encryption settings, and disabling cameras. 
Once the app has been activated, the malware runs in the back­
ground, abusing broad permissions to access device contacts, call 
logs, track device location, send messages, access external storage, 
take pictures, and record audio. The collected information is in JSON 
format and transmitted to the remote server. Also, unknown at this 
stage is the exact initial access vector used to distribute the spyware 
and the intended goals of the campaign. The rogue Android app

also attempts to download a legitimate application called Roz Dhan 
(meaning ‘daily wealth’ in Hindi), which has over 10 million down­
loads and allows users to earn cash rewards for completing surveys 
and questionnaires. In July 2022, however, TAG revealed that Turla 
would create another malicious Android app; this time, however, 
to support pro-Ukrainian hacktivists to launch Distributed Denial-
of-Service (DDoS) attacks against Russian sites. This activity by Turla 
dovetails with what has been written so far to support the group’s 
casualty profiling efforts coinciding with the Russo-Ukrainian war 
and SVR interests, helping the agency gather information of inter­
est to the Russian government [58].
7.3.  FSB
The Federal Security Service, or FSB, is Russia’s ­principal 
internal security agency, responsible for internal security and 
counterintelligence. The FSB’s tasks are protecting Russia from 
foreign cyber operations and monitoring domestic cybercrimi­
nal groups, a mission undertaken jointly with Department K of 
the Ministry of Internal Affairs [59]. In recent years, the FSB has 
expanded its remit to include foreign intelligence gathering and 
OCOs. Today’s state-sponsored hacker groups linked to the FSB are 
Callisto, EnergeticBear, Gamaredon, TeamSpy, Dragonfly, Havex, 
CrouchingYeti, and Koala. SBU intelligence analysts say that the 
FSB has two primary centres overseeing information security and 
cyber operations. The first is the 16th Center, which houses most 
of the FSB’s intelligence capabilities. The second is the 18th Center 
for information security, which oversees operations within national 
borders, but also conducts operations abroad. Like the GRU, the 
FSB oversees dedicated training and research institutes, which 
directly support the agency’s offensive activities. Most of the opera­
tions appear to be reconnaissance or clandestine surveillance [60]. 
In 2021, Ukrainian intelligence released information and record­
ings about Crimean-based 18th FSB Center officers as part of the 
Gamaredon hacker group. Media reports indicate that this FSB unit 
is capable of developing advanced malware, and modifying known 
malware to imitate other APTs to hide their activities. Here we 
limit our analysis to the two main APTs linked to FSB: Callisto and 
Gamaredon.
(1) Callisto: Callisto has been an APT focused on cyber espionage 
at least since 2015. Over the years, this group has targeted vari­
ous organisations, including government institutions and military 
officials in Eastern Europe and the South Caucasus. The APT uses 
spear-phishing campaigns and social engineering tactics to inject 
Disjointed Cyber Warfare
www.acigjournal.com  –––  acig, vol. 4, no. 2, 2024  –––  doi: 10.60097/ACIG/192120
malware into its targets. The group has also been observed to 
use remote access trojans (RATs) and credential-stealing malware 
to exfiltrate sensitive information from their victims. Callisto (aka 
COLDRIVER) is suspected to be a Russian APT which – although not 
publicly linked with any Russian intelligence service – has, in past 
operations, been shown to have objectives which align closely with 
the strategic interests of the FSB. Callisto mainly focuses on specific 
Western countries, namely, the United States and Eastern European 
countries [61]. During the conflict in Ukraine, the group master­
minded several phishing campaigns aimed at stealing credentials, 
targeting areas of military and strategic research, such as NATO 
entities and defence entities based in Ukraine, as well as NGOs and 
think tanks. Additional targets include former intelligence officials, 
experts on Russian affairs, and Russian citizens abroad. While the 
SBU, the Security Service of Ukraine, has publicly associated Callisto 
with the Gamaredon group – which we discuss in the next section 
– through a set of hacks attributed to the FSB and essentially focus­
ing on operations in Ukraine since the start of the Russian invasion 
in February 2022, other security companies do not support this 
link [62]. In particular, the IT security company SEKOIA.IO has con­
ducted numerous technical investigations, not finding any overlap 
between the activities of Callisto and Gamaredon, nor any coordina­
tion or cooperation activity between the two APTs, indicating a lack 
of intra-agency coordination. They instead suggest that these are 
two groups operating on different targets and purposes. Based on 
what SEKOIA.IO investigated, domains aligned with Callisto’s past 
activities. Further investigations resulted in a more extensive infra­
structure of more than 80 domains, including domain typosquatting 
activities. Since many of these domains were already known and the 
IP address resolution was already attributed to Callisto’s activities, 
SEKOIA.IO only associated these domains with Callisto with high 
confidence. In campaigns observed in the past, Callisto sent mali­
cious PDF attachments to their victims. The first page of the PDF 
simulated an error in the PDF renderer engine, prompting the vic­
tim to open a link that led to a malicious web page. This web page 
was tasked with collecting the victim’s credentials using EvilGinx. 
Placing the phishing link in a PDF, rather than in the body of the 
email, prevents the link from being parsed by email gateways and 
is an effective tactic to remain undetected from an attacker´s per­
spective. SEKOIA.IO conducted open-source research on typosquat­
ted domains to identify targets. Six private companies based in the 
United States and Eastern Europe, and four s NGOs were identified, 
all involved in supporting Ukraine. Most of the targeted private 
organisations engage in activities related to military equipment, mil­
itary logistics, or humanitarian support for Ukraine, including a US 
Cosimo Melella, Francesco Ferazza, Konstantinos Mersinas

company that supplies humanitarian logistics and possibly tactical 
equipment to Kyiv. Other industries include information technology 
and computer security. SEKOIA.IO notes that all the targets identi­
fied so far through the investigation, namely, the industrial and mil­
itary entities affected and the individuals involved in Russian affairs, 
are in line with Calisto’s interests. Callisto also targets support which 
is not directly related to Ukraine. Among Calisto’s malicious domains 
discovered, three have caught the attention of analysts, namely, 
mvd-redir[.]ru and dns-mvd[.]ru (high confidence), which are 
most likely a typosquatting of the Russian Interior Ministry, and lk-­
nalog-gov[.]ru (with low confidence), the Russian Federal Tax 
Service. Because Callisto has been observed to target Russian 
individuals overseas, SEKOIA.IO finds it plausible that Callisto also 
engages in domestic surveillance activities. Another, less plausible, 
hypothesis would be a false flag manoeuvre to raise doubts about 
the attribution of the infrastructure. SEKOIA.IO found another 
potential victim that matches Callisto’s known targeting. The 
domains sangrail-share[.]com and sangrail-ltd[.]com are typosquat­
ting Sangrail Inc., a private security company, registered in the 
United Kingdom on July 31, 2019, by Ian Walter Baharie. That name 
was also used to register AC21, a British private intelligence firm 
focused on African politics [63]. Interestingly, this name appeared in 
a 17-year-old data leak that exposed a list of several MI6 officers on 
cryptome.org, a website dedicated to information leaks. That obser­
vation matches Microsoft’s assessment of Callisto targeting former 
intelligence officers. It should be assessed that this kind of intru­
sion is aimed at a targeted collection of information contributing 
to the Russian efforts to interrupt the supply chain of military rein­
forcements for Kyiv. Nonetheless, SEKOIA.IO estimates that Callisto 
contributes to intelligence gathering for Russian intelligence on 
identified evidence related to war crimes or international justice 
proceedings, likely to anticipate and build a counter-narrative about 
future allegations. Among Callisto’s targets, there would also be 
NGOs and European and international institutions, evidence that 
this type of activity could enter the sphere of competence of the SVR 
and would indicate competitive activity between this agency and 
the FSB.
(2) Gamaredon: Gamaredon’s activity as an APT has been observed 
since 2013. It is believed to have ties with FSB, specifically Unit 71330. 
Although Gamaredon and Dragonfly are two separate APTs, both 
may be related to Unit 71330. While Gamaredon mainly focuses 
on cyber espionage and intelligence gathering, Dragonfly  (also 
known as EnergeticBear or Crouching Yeti) is reportedly notorious 
for sophisticated and multi-stage attacks aimed at compromising 
Disjointed Cyber Warfare

industrial control systems (ICS) and control systems of supervi­
sion and data acquisition (SCADA). Furthermore, while both groups 
may share TTPs, such as the use of spear-­phishing emails as an ini­
tial attack vector, there is no direct evidence to suggest that they 
are related or operate jointly. Gamaredon uses a variety of tech­
niques and tools to compromise its targets, including, as already 
mentioned, spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments, 
social engineering attacks, and exploitation of known software vul­
nerabilities (n-days). Some of the malware and tools used by the 
Gamaredon group include Pteranodon, Jupyter, and PowerShell-
based tools [64]. In more detail, Gamaredon uses PowerShell 
scripts to automate various tasks, such as malware distribu­
tion, privilege escalation, and data exfiltration. Since the Russian 
invasion of Ukraine, the group remains one of the critical cyber 
threats to Ukrainian cyberspace. Gamaredon would operate from 
Sevastopol in Russian-occupied Crimea, acting on orders from the 
FSB’s Center for Information Security in Moscow. The group began 
operations in June 2013, just months before Russia annexed the 
Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine. In its recent information-gath­
ering campaigns against Ukraine, Gamaredon used malware writ­
ten in PowerShell, known as GammaLoad and GammaSteel. These 
data exfiltration tools manage to capture files of specific exten­
sions, steal user credentials, and take screenshots of the victim’s 
computer. These two pieces of malware are not new and were pre­
viously used by Gamaredon to target Ukraine’s government and 
security services. Hackers use phishing emails to gain initial access 
to the victim’s network. These emails contain malicious LNK files 
distributed in RAR archives. Only users with Ukrainian IP addresses 
can open these files. Hackers send phishing emails from domains 
associated with legitimate organisations, such as the Security 
Service of Ukraine, and the names of the malicious files included 
are usually associated with the war in Ukraine. Gamaredon’s recent 
activity is characterised by the multi-stage distribution of malware 
payloads used to maintain persistence. These payloads represent 
similar variants of the same malware, each designed to behave 
the same way as the others. According to CERT-UA, Gamaredon’s 
TTPs would have evolved during the war, improving its tactics and 
retraining the malware variants used to go undetected. CERT-UA 
said [41] that Gamaredon is responsible for the most significant 
cyberattacks in Ukraine (even higher than those carried out by 
Sandworm), recording more than 70 incidents related to the group 
in 2022. Gamaredon also attacks allies of Ukraine. Latvia confirmed 
a phishing attack on its defence ministry in late January 2022, link­
ing it to the group. Ukrainian cybersecurity officials described 
their attacks as intrusive and daring, and said the group’s primary

purpose is to conduct targeted cyber intelligence operations [54]. 
Case study analysis of OCOs conducted by the Russian GRU, SVR, 
and FSB agencies highlights a complexity and sophistication that 
transcends the execution of conventional cyberattacks. In the con­
text of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, however, it emerged how 
the APTs linked to these agencies exploited their distinctive skills 
to implement operations, highlighting a level of internal coordina­
tion, which, precisely because of the inevitable tensions and diver­
gences, significantly influenced the effectiveness and the extent 
of their actions in cyberspace. The case study investigation not 
only enriches our understanding of the operational TTPs peculiar 
to the Russian cyber offensive but also highlights how the lack of 
coordination can limit the overall impact of operations in the dig­
ital domain. Due to this lack of uniform coordination, the ability to 
operate highlights a strategic dimension that can surprisingly work 
against Russian offensive capabilities in cyberspace.
8.  Conclusions
This evolving, descriptive paper scrutinises the intricate 
coordination within intelligence agencies, with a particular empha­
sis on the Russian landscape. The study is methodically structured 
around two principal RQs that guide the exploration of this com­
plex domain. RQ1 seeks to unravel: ‘To what degree is integration 
between technical and operational levels achieved within intelli­
gence agencies responsible for executing offensive government 
policies in cyberspace?’ This inquiry casts light on the multifaceted 
nature of coordinating cyber operations that engage numerous 
state-endorsed APTs managed by various intelligence units. The 
coordination challenges identified encompass a spectrum of tech­
nical dilemmas, including system compatibility, software intricacies, 
network issues, and timing delays. Additionally, it examines stra­
tegic complications, such as the intersection and potential conflict 
of objectives and methodologies among different agencies, which 
could escalate into issues of territorial and power disputes. RQ2 
examines: ‘What elements hinder the integration between technical 
and operational levels in intelligence agencies tasked with enacting 
government defensive strategies in cyberspace?’ This query delves 
into the impediments to effective inter-agency cooperation, high­
lighting factors like varying organisational cultures and operational 
dynamics. Issues such as disparities in trust-building, leadership 
styles, decision-making processes, and management of uncertain­
ties are explored, as these can lead to misalignments in objectives 
and misunderstandings. The paper also addresses the critical ‘prin­
cipal-agent’ dynamic, wherein intelligence agencies (agents) have 
Disjointed Cyber Warfare

greater informational access than decision-makers (principals), 
leading to potential reluctances in information sharing and nega­
tively impacting strategic decision-making and intelligence opera­
tions. The research uncovers the profound rivalry among Russian 
intelligence agencies, notably FSB, SVR, and GRU, marked by their 
overlapping roles and internal competitions. This environment, 
coupled with the necessity for cohesive coordination in cyber oper­
ations, unveils a host of technical, strategic, and human-centric 
challenges [65]. While this study has focused on specific organi­
sational, cultural, and operational factors impeding coordination 
between intelligence agencies, it is important to acknowledge 
that there may be additional elements at play. These could include 
geopolitical considerations, budgetary constraints, and techno­
logical disparities. The rapidly evolving nature of cyber threats 
and technologies may also contribute to coordination challenges, 
as agencies may struggle to keep pace with new developments 
and adapt their strategies accordingly. Furthermore, the broader 
political landscape and national security priorities can significantly 
influence inter-agency dynamics. Changes in government admin­
istration, shifts in foreign policy, or emerging global threats may 
alter the balance of power and responsibilities among intelligence 
agencies, potentially exacerbating existing coordination issues or 
creating new ones. As a work in progress, this research paves the 
way for a multitude of future inquiries. These prospects span vari­
ous methodologies and themes within the cyber intelligence field, 
encompassing the study of organisational behaviours in intelli­
gence agencies, the analysis of collaborative mechanisms between 
different agencies, and the exploration of strategies to effectively 
navigate the complex dynamics inherent in state-­sponsored cyber 
operations. In conclusion, while the coordination of APTs across 
multiple intelligence agencies holds significant potential to enhance 
the impact of cyber operations, it is entangled with a series of for­
midable challenges. Addressing these challenges necessitates an 
all-encompassing grasp of the nuances in cyber operations, an 
acknowledgment of the cultural and operational variances among 
agencies, and adept management of the ‘principal-agent’ dynamic. 
Only through a comprehensive approach to these factors can intel­
ligence entities fully harness the capabilities of coordinated cyber 
operations [2].
