Suspected Iran-Nexus TAG-56
Uses UAE Forum Lure for
Credential Theft Against US
Think Tank
CTA-IR-2022-1129
CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS
From Insikt Group
November 29, 2022
This report covers threat activity that is highly likely related to a broader campaign led by a suspected
Iran-nexus threat activity group, TAG-56. Insikt Group discovered this threat activity via threat-hunting
techniques. This research is pertinent to individuals and organizations that cover Iranian cyber
operations, IT security employees, members of think tanks, non-governmental organizations,
journalists, and governments.
Executive Summary
In early November 2022, Insikt Group identified a phishing and follow-on credential theft attack highly
likely led by an Iran-nexus threat activity group directed against the US-based Washington Institute
think tank. The credential theft component masquerades as a Microsoft registration form for the 2022
Sir Bani Yas Forum hosted by the government of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The threat activity is
highly likely indicative of a broader campaign that makes use of URL shorteners to direct victims to
malicious pages where credentials are stolen. This tradecraft is common among Iran-nexus advanced
persistent threat (APT) groups like APT42 and Phosphorus.
Insikt Group identified 5 domains highly likely used to host credential theft pages. The credential theft
examples associated with this research were submitted to urlscan throughout 2022. The most recent
submission was from the UAE on November 3, 2022. As of this writing, it is highly likely that this threat
activity is related to an ongoing campaign. Insikt Group tracks this activity under the temporary group
designator TAG-56.
Threat Analysis
Initial Discovery
On November 3, 2022, Insikt Group identified a suspicious urlscan submission from a user in the UAE
that returned a fake Microsoft registration form for the 2022 Sir Bani Yas Forum as noted in Figure 1.
The intended target of the attack is a senior fellow of the Washington Institute, a US-based think tank
focused on US foreign policy in the Near East. The submission data revealed that the victim likely
received a spearphishing message that, when clicked, would redirect them to a URL with the apex
domain name — mailer-daemon[.]net — where the spoofed registration page is hosted.

The domain “mailer-daemon[.]net” was registered on October 11, 2022, via Namecheap and uses
WHOIS privacy protection. The domain has resolved to 162.0.232[.]252 since October 11, 2022. The
reverse DNS for 162.0.232[.]252 is “web-hosting[.]com”, which is associated with Namecheap's shared
hosting services.
Insikt Group identified 4 further domains, listed in Table 1 below, which use an identical domain naming
convention as mailer-daemon[.]net. All but 1 domain, “mailer-daemon[.]org”, use Namecheap's shared
hosting services. The domain “mailer-daemon[.]org” was registered using GoDaddy. Open-source
reporting reveals similar domains, specifically “mailerdaemon[.]me” and “mailer-daemon-message[.]co”,
were used by members of the Phosphorus APT group to lead attacks throughout 2020 and 2021.

The Fake URL Shortener
A fake URL shortener, “tinyurl[.]ink”, which spoofs the legitimate service TinyURL (tinyurl[.]com), was
identified as part of our research. The fake URL shortener was used to deliver a lure document — “Iran
nuke.docx” — titled "ANOTHER FLAWED IRAN DEAL AND THE NEXT PHASE OF US POLICY", which, as
the title implies, concerns Iran's nuclear program. The document, shown in Figure 2, is benign and was
likely used by the attackers to lower the precautionary behavior of the intended target. In a June 2022
report regarding an Iranian APT campaign that targeted US and Israeli government officials, Check
Point Research noted that benign documents were sent to targets to initiate conversations.

As part of the delivery of “Iran nuke.docx”, TAG-56 operatives used the fake URL shortener in
conjunction with the legitimate shortening service tinyurl[.]com as depicted in Figure 3. The attack
chain started with the operatives delivering a message using the legitimate URL shortener
(tinyurl[.]com) against a suspected target; if the target clicked on the link, they were redirected to the
spoofed equivalent (tinyurl[.]ink). Another submission to urlscan from Israel revealed that TAG-56 used
tinyurl[.]com to engage with a suspected target using the “mailer-daemon[.]live” domain. At the time of
analysis, “mailer-daemon[.]live” resolved to another IP address owned by Namecheap: 198.54.116[.]118.

We do not know how TAG-56 disseminated any of the links associated with this research, although it is
highly likely that spearphishing, or potentially an encrypted chat platform, was used for delivery. Some
Iran-nexus operators, such as those associated with APT42, have been known to send links directly to
victims' WhatsApp or Telegram accounts and engage in chats to manipulate them through social
engineering.

Server Configuration
The Namecheap server configuration of “tinyurl[.]ink” revealed another notable overlap to threat activity
reported by Check Point Research: the attackers used a shared web host provided by Namecheap to
establish their infrastructure, an aspect of TAG-56’s tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that
was also observed in the campaign reported by Check Point Research. In that campaign, the
attacker-controlled infrastructure also included a fake URL shortener, “litby[.]us”. This suggests that
TAG-56 operators prefer to acquire purpose-built infrastructure as opposed to establishing their own.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS
Check Point Researchers also cited that the HTML of the URL shortener (litby[.]us) revealed direct links
to a cluster of threat activity attributed to the Phosphorus APT in 2020. The domain “de-ma[.]online”
underlined in Figure 4 has not had an active DNS “A” record since November 2020.
Figure 4: HTML code revealing links to de-ma[.]online domain (Source: Check Point Research)
Insikt Group identified the likely reuse of code in the HTML of the Sir Bani Yas spoofed registration
page. A JavaScript function specifically lists a variable "passwd.trim()=="SaudiG20", which is likely
not related to the Sir Bani Yas forum and is more likely associated with the G20 meeting hosted by
Saudi Arabia in 2020.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS
The Sir Bani Yas forum spoofed login page also contained a redirect that included the string
"continue-to-settings.php". The same string was identified in another submission made to urlscan
on August 6, 2021. This submission revealed a malicious login page for Yahoo mail (another case of
credential theft), but the apex domain used for the attack was “continuetogo[.]me”. This domain was
referenced in a report by Google’s Threat Analysis Group in October 2021 and is associated with APT35.
Threat researchers from multiple cybersecurity vendors have previously revealed strategic and
technical overlaps between APT35, Charming Kitten, TA453, and APT42 (along with its forerunner
UNC788).

Mitigations
●
Establish robust policies and carry out social engineering and anti-phishing awareness exercises
to help detect and prevent attacks.
●
Use strong passwords and enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) where possible to limit the
potential damage of credential theft.
●
Monitor for domain abuse, such as typosquat domains spoofing your organization, through the
Recorded Future Brand Intelligence (BI) module. The SecurityTrails extension is available to any
customer that has a subscription to the Threat Intelligence (TI) or BI modules. The LogoType
source and alerting is exclusive to the BI module, though the TI module does have access to the
data via the Advanced Query Builder.
●
“Cold-calling” is a common method Iranian social engineering operators use to engage with
victims. This includes direct messaging on social media platforms as well as on encrypted chats.
Be on the lookout for signs of inauthentic or reused material and attempt to directly verify with
the source when possible.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS
Outlook
TAG-56 depicts many of the known TTPs associated with groups like APT42 and Phosphorus. This
includes the domain naming conventions associated with attacker-controlled infrastructure, the use of
recycled code, and the intended victim of the credential theft operation. The use of recycled HTML
code is presumably a recurrent aspect of TAG-56's tradecraft, which notwithstanding the increased
chance of detection by threat researchers, is still likely providing the attackers sufficient return on
investment to not warrant a shift in TTPs.
The victimology of the threat activity associated with APT42 and Phosphorus is widely reported in open
sources (1, 2, 3), as think tanks provide strategic-level information of intelligence value to their
presumed handlers. The targeting overlap identified with TAG-56 supports our assessment that this
threat cluster has strong overlaps with the aforementioned APT groups.
