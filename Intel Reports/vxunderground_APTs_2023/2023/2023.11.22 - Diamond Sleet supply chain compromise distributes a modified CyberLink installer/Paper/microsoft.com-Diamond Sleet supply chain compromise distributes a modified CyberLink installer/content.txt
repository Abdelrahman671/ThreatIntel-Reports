Diamond Sleet supply chain compromise distributes a modified
CyberLink installer
⋮ 11/22/2023
By	Microsoft Threat Intelligence
Microsoft Threat Intelligence has uncovered a supply chain attack by the North Korea-based threat actor
Diamond Sleet (ZINC) involving a malicious variant of an application developed by CyberLink Corp., a software
company that develops multimedia software products. This malicious file is a legitimate CyberLink application
installer that has been modified to include malicious code that downloads, decrypts, and loads a second-stage
payload. The file, which was signed using a valid certificate issued to CyberLink Corp., is hosted on legitimate
update infrastructure owned by CyberLink and includes checks to limit the time window for execution and evade
detection by security products. Thus far, the malicious activity has impacted over 100 devices in multiple
countries, including Japan, Taiwan, Canada, and the United States.
Microsoft attributes this activity with high confidence to Diamond Sleet, a North Korean threat actor. The second-
stage payload observed in this campaign communicates with infrastructure that has been previously
compromised by Diamond Sleet. More recently, Microsoft has observed Diamond Sleet utilizing trojanized open-
source and proprietary software to target organizations in information technology, defense, and media.

To address the potential risk of further attacks against our customers, Microsoft has taken the following steps to
protect customers in response to this malicious activity:
Microsoft has communicated this supply chain compromise to CyberLink 
Microsoft is notifying Microsoft Defender for Endpoint customers that have been targeted or compromised
in this campaign
Microsoft reported the attack to GitHub, which removed the second-stage payload in accordance with its
Acceptable Use Policies
Microsoft has added the CyberLink Corp. certificate used to sign the malicious file to its disallowed
certificate list
Microsoft Defender for Endpoint detects this activity as Diamond Sleet activity group.
Microsoft Defender Antivirus detects the malware as Trojan:Win32/LambLoad.
Microsoft may update this blog as additional insight is gained into the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)
used by the threat actor in this active and ongoing campaign.
Who is Diamond Sleet?
The actor that Microsoft tracks as Diamond Sleet (formerly ZINC) is a North Korea-based activity group known to
target media, defense, and information technology (IT) industries globally. Diamond Sleet focuses on espionage,
theft of personal and corporate data, financial gain, and corporate network destruction. Diamond Sleet is known
to use a variety of custom malware that is exclusive to the group. Recent Diamond Sleet malware is described in
Microsoft’s reporting of the group’s weaponization of open source software and exploitation of N-day
vulnerabilities. Diamond Sleet overlaps with activity tracked by other security companies as Temp.Hermit and
Labyrinth Chollima.

Activity overview
Microsoft has observed suspicious activity associated with the modified CyberLink installer file as early as
October 20, 2023. The malicious file has been seen on over 100 devices in multiple countries, including Japan,
Taiwan, Canada, and the United States. While Microsoft has not yet identified hands-on-keyboard activity carried
out after compromise via this malware, the group has historically:
Exfiltrated sensitive data from victim environments
Compromised software build environments
Moved downstream to additional victims for further exploitation
Used techniques to establish persistent access to victim environments
Diamond Sleet utilized a legitimate code signing certificate issued to CyberLink Corp. to sign the malicious
executable. This certificate has been added to Microsoft’s disallowed certificate list to protect customers from
future malicious use of the certificate:
Signer: CyberLink Corp. 

Issuer: DigiCert SHA2 Assured ID Code Signing CA 

SignerHash: 8aa3877ab68ba56dabc2f2802e813dc36678aef4 

CertificateSerialNumber: 0a08d3601636378f0a7d64fd09e4a13b

Microsoft currently tracks the malicious application and associated payloads as LambLoad.
LambLoad
LambLoad is a weaponized downloader and loader containing malicious code added to a legitimate CyberLink
application. The primary LambLoad loader/downloader sample Microsoft identified has the SHA-256 hash
166d1a6ddcde4e859a89c2c825cd3c8c953a86bfa92b343de7e5bfbfb5afb8be.
Before launching any malicious code, the LambLoad executable ensures that the date and time of the local host
align with a preconfigured execution period.

The loader then targets environments that are not using security software affiliated with FireEye, CrowdStrike, or
Tanium by checking for the following process names:
csfalconservice.exe (CrowdStrike Falcon)
xagt.exe (FireEye agent)
taniumclient.exe (Tanium EDR solution)
If these criteria are not met, the executable continues running the CyberLink software and abandons further
execution of malicious code. Otherwise, the software attempts to contact one of three URLs to download the
second-stage payload embedded inside a file masquerading as a PNG file using the static User-Agent ‘Microsoft
Internet Explorer’:

hxxps[:]//cldownloader.github[.]io/logo.png
The PNG file contains an embedded payload inside a fake outer PNG header that is, carved, decrypted, and
launched in memory.

When invoked, the in-memory executable attempts to contact the following callbacks for further instruction. Both
domains are legitimate but have been compromised by Diamond Sleet:

hxxps[:]//zeduzeventos.busqueabuse[.]com/wp-admin/js/widgets/sub/wids.php
The crypted contents of the PNG file (SHA-256:
089573b3a1167f387dcdad5e014a5132e998b2c89bff29bcf8b06dd497d4e63d) may be manually carved using
the following command:
To restore the in-memory payload statically for independent analysis, the following Python script can be used to
decrypt the carved contents.

To crypt and verify:
Both the fake PNG and decrypted PE payload have been made available on VirusTotal.
Recommendations
Microsoft recommends the following mitigations to reduce the impact of this threat. Check the recommendations
card for the deployment status of monitored mitigations.
Use Microsoft Defender Antivirus to protect from this threat. Turn on cloud-delivered protection and
automatic sample submission on Microsoft Defender Antivirus. These capabilities use artificial intelligence
and machine learning to quickly identify and stop new and unknown threats.
Enable network protection to prevent applications or users from accessing malicious domains and other
malicious content on the internet.
Enable investigation and remediation in full automated mode to allow Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to
take immediate action on alerts to resolve breaches, significantly reducing alert volume.
Take immediate action to address malicious activity on the impacted device. If malicious code has been
launched, the attacker has likely taken complete control of the device. Immediately isolate the system and
perform a reset of credentials and tokens.
Investigate the device timeline for indications of lateral movement activities using one of the compromised
accounts. Check for additional tools that attackers might have dropped to enable credential access, lateral
movement, and other attack activities. Ensure data integrity with hash codes.
Turn on the following attack surface reduction rule: Block executable files from running unless they meet a
prevalence, age, or trusted list criterion.
