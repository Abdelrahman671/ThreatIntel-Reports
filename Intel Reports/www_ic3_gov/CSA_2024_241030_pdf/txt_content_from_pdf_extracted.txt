New Tradecraft of Iranian Cyber Group Aria 
Sepehr Ayandehsazan aka Emennet Pasargad 
Summary 
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), U.S. Department of Treasury, and Israel National Cyber 
Directorate are releasing this Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) to warn network defenders of new cyber 
tradecraft of the Iranian cyber group Emennet Pasargad, which has been operating under the company 
name Aria Sepehr Ayandehsazan (ASA) and is known by the private sector terms Cotton Sandstorm, 
Marnanbridge, and Haywire Kitten. The group exhibited new tradecraft in its efforts to conduct cyber-
enabled information operations into mid-2024 using a myriad of cover personas, including multiple cyber 
operations that occurred during and targeting the 2024 Summer Olympics – including the compromise of a 
French commercial dynamic display provider. ASA has also undertaken a project to harvest content from IP 
cameras and used online resources related to Artificial Intelligence. Since 2023, the group has exhibited 
new tradecraft including the use of fictitious hosting resellers to provision operational server infrastructure 
to its own actors as well as to an actor in Lebanon involved in website hosting. Recently released reporting 
from Microsoft indicates this group has demonstrated interest in election-related websites and media 
outlets, suggesting preparations for future influence operations. 
This CSA provides the threat group’s tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), including its leveraging of 
online resources related to Artificial Intelligence, and indicators of compromise (IOCs). The CSA also 
highlights similar activity from a previous FBI advisory that was published on 20 October 2022. This new 
advisory’s information and guidance are derived from FBI investigative activity and technical analysis of 
this group’s intrusion activity against U.S. and foreign organizations and engagements with numerous 
entities impacted by this malicious activity. 
The authoring agencies recommend all organizations follow guidance provided in the Mitigations  section to 
defend against the Iranian cyber group’s activities.  
If you suspect your organization has been targeted or compromised by the Iranian cyber actors, the 
authoring agencies recommend immediately contacting your local FBI field office  for assistance. 
For more information on Iranian state-sponsored malicious cyber activity, see CISA’s Iran Cyber Threat  
webpage.

TLP:CLEARThreat Actor Details 
Details on Threat Group and Prior Activity 
FBI previously reported in a Private Industry Notification1 (PIN) that Emennet Pasargad2, 3 has been 
conducting hack-and-leak operations against organizations primarily in Israel. FBI assesses these 
operations are intended to undermine public confidence in the security of the victim’s network and data, as 
well as embarrass victim companies and targeted countries. These hack-and-leak campaigns involve a 
combination of hacking/theft of data and information operations that impact victims through financial 
losses and reputational damage. Similar to the Emennet campaign that targeted the 2020 U.S. 
Presidential election4, FBI judges the group's recent campaigns include a mix of computer intrusion activity 
and exaggerated or fictitious claims of access to victim networks or stolen data to enhance the 
psychological effects of their operations.  
Since the publication of this PIN, FBI has acquired new information on cyber tradecraft the group has 
employed in recent cyber operations impacting numerous countries, including Israel, France, Sweden, and 
the U.S. Further details regarding the ”Anzu Team” cyber-enabled information operation against Sweden 
have been outlined in public statements made by Swedish government authorities.5,6 Recently released 
information from Microsoft indicates this group has been actively scouting election-related websites and 
media outlets, suggesting preparations for more direct influence operations as Election Day nears.7  
New Attribution Details 
FBI obtained reliable information in mid-2024 indicating Emennet Pasargad has more recently been using 
the Iranian company name Aria Sepehr Ayandehsazan (ASA, Iranian Registration Number 504415) as a 
nominal cover, including for human resources and financial-related purposes.

New Infrastructure Tradecraft 
FBI also acquired information indicating that since approximately mid-2023, ASA has used several cover 
hosting providers for infrastructure management and obfuscation. These two providers are ”Server-Speed” 
(server-speed[.]com) and ”VPS-Agent” (vps-agent[.]net8). Whereas actors typically procure virtual 
infrastructure from hosting resellers, ASA set up its own resellers and procured server space from Europe-
based providers, including the Lithuania-based company BAcloud and Stark Industries Solutions/PQ 
Hosting (located in the United Kingdom and Moldova, respectively). ASA then leverages these cover re-
sellers to provision operational servers to its own cyber actors for malicious cyber activities. FBI has also 
observed ASA using these cover re-sellers to provide technical support to identified Lebanon-based 
individuals, including with hosting for HAMAS-affiliated or themed websites. For example, FBI assesses the 
website alqassam[.]ps - a website associated with the military wing of HAMAS - was supported by both ASA 
and its contacts in Lebanon. ASA has also provided hosting support for Lebanon-based actors operating 
the website almaq.org.  
FBI assesses these cover hosting providers were set up by ASA to centralize and manage provisioning of 
operational infrastructure, while providing plausible deniability that malicious infrastructure was being 
assigned by a legitimate hosting provider. FBI previously observed ASA use ”Server-Speed” from 
approximately April 2023 until May 2024, when the actors pivoted to using the entity ”VPS-Agent.”

Continuing Cyber-Enabled Information Operations 
The authoring agencies have continued to observe ASA conducting cyber-enabled information operations 
over the past year. In particular, following the October 7, 2023, HAMAS attack against Israel, ASA used 
various cover personas such as "Cyber Flood" and "Contact-HSTG." In its “Contact-HSTG” operation, ASA 
attempted to contact family members of Israeli hostages, likely in an effort to cause additional 
psychological effects and inflict further trauma on family members. An example of this messaging is shown 
below: 
 
 
SMS translation: 
“Family 
This the message from Al-Qasam 
We offered your government hostage exchange deal, but 
It did not accept it. 
This is our message: 
Releasing all the Zionists hostages in exchange 
To all Palestinians prisoners  
In order to know what is the condition of all your hostages  
Keep in touch with us” 
 
ASA was also responsible for a cyber-enabled influence operation in December 2023 that impacted a US-
based Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) streaming company. The operation, which used the persona name 
"For-Humanity," leveraged unauthorized access to IPTV streaming services to disseminate crafted 

 
  FBI | Treasury | INCDTLP:CLEAR 
Page 6 of 16  |  Product ID: AA24-233A 
TLP:CLEARmessaging pertaining to the Israel-HAMAS military conflict. The authoring agencies warn that future ASA 
cyber operations may either directly target, or collaterally impact, US organizations. 
The authoring agencies assess that, since April 2024, ASA has used the online persona “Cyber Court” to 
promote the activities of several purported hacktivist groups conducting malicious activity against various 
countries as a means of protesting the Israel-HAMAS conflict in Gaza. Using “Cyber Court,” ASA promotes 
the hacking activities of cover-hacktivist groups - run by ASA itself - including “Makhlab al-Nasr,” “NET 
Hunter,” “Emirate Students Movement,” and “Zeus is Talking.” “Cyber Court” posted updates regarding 
these groups' purported activities on its Telegram channel (@cybercourt_io) as well as its website 
cybercourt[.]io9. ASA has also been developing an information operation campaign named ”Sample,” 
intended to intimidate Israelis via crowdsourcing reporting to positively identify specified individuals, such 
as members of Israeli law enforcement. 
 
(Content related to ”Sample” information operations campaign) 
In July 2024, the actors used "VPS-agent" infrastructure to compromise a French commercial dynamic 
display provider, attempting to display photo montages denouncing the participation of Israeli athletes in 
the 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games. This cyberattack was coupled with disinformation maneuvers 
including publication of a fake news article onto a French collaborative media website and the spread of 
threat messages to several Israeli athletes and their entourage under the banner of a fake French far-right 
group 'Regiment GUD', impersonating the real French far-right group 'GUD'. 
 
IP Camera Targeting Activity 
ASA also undertook a significant effort to enumerate and obtain content from IP cameras in Israel, 
including hours after the October 7, 2023, HAMAS attack. ASA enumerated IP addresses running the Real 
Time Streaming Protocol (TCP Port 554), primarily in Israel but also in Gaza and Iran. ASA made images 
and content from Israeli cameras available for clients to access via several servers beginning in October 
2023, including 5.230.56[.]148 and 77.91.74[.]158 – the latter IP being used between January and

Harvesting of Open Source Information 
Also following October 7, 2023, ASA attempted to identify information concerning Israeli fighter pilots and 
UAV operators by searching for information across numerous platforms including Pastebin and LinkedIn. 
ASA also used a Python script to identify location data from Instagram and correlate the data with the 
service openstreetmap.org. ASA uses numerous online services for identifying people, reverse-image 
searching, and username checks through open source software including knowem.com, facecheck.id, 
socialcatfish.com. The actors also use online resources such as ancestry.com and familysearch.org in their 
operations. ASA will also search for information concerning previously leaked data sets, including using the 
resource ghostproject.fr. 
Incorporation of Artificial Intelligence into Operations 
The aforementioned “For-Humanity” operation is well-known for its incorporation of generative Artificial 
Intelligence (an AI-generated news anchor) as part of its messaging efforts. This is consistent with a greater 
ASA effort to incorporate AI-related services into its operations including using the Remini AI Photo 
Enhancer, Voicemod (voicemod.net) and Murf AI (murf.ai) for voice modulation, and Appy Pie for image 
generation.  
 
Technical Details 
Note: This advisory uses the MITRE ATT&CK® for Enterprise  framework, version 15.1. See the MITRE

Tool. 
Overview of Observed Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures 
The following sections outline cyber TTPs used by the ASA group during its current and historical cyber 
operations. 
ASA will likely seek opportunities where they can achieve a high number of compromises with minimal 
effort by targeting hosting providers that would offer access to other entities, or targeting a specific content 
management system used by entities in a specific sector.  
Reconnaissance, Initial Access, Persistence, and Credential Access 
ASA leverages numerous types of online datasets to conduct research against its targets, including both 
individual users and organizations. When targeting individuals , ASA uses websites to identify email 
addresses associated with particular domains, conduct username checks against social media, and 
reverse image and email searching. When conducting target reconnaissance and enumeration against 
organizations, ASA uses open source resources such as Shodan, IP2location, and 
subdomainfinder.c99[.]nl. 
For initial access and exploitation, ASA uses commercially available tools such as Masscan, Acunetix, Burp 
Suite, and SQLMap. 
Resource Development 
ASA has used the aforementioned cover hosting resellers ”Server-Speed” and ”VPS-Agent” to procure 
operational infrastructure. The actors also heavily leverage commercial VPN service providers such as 
Private Internet Access, Windscribe, ExpressVPN, Urban VPN, and NordVPN. 
Credential Access 
ASA has accessed victim infrastructure via automated password-guessing attempts as well as online 
resources for cracking password hashes. 
Command and Control 
ASA has used an exploitation tool for gathering information about an end point and running remote 
commands. 
ASA has also used the file 'Google Chrome Installer.msi', which is a Microsoft Software Installer package 
file. This file originally contained the instructions and information needed to install a security patch for the 
Google Chrome Web browser (version 126.0.6478.255). The msi file has been altered to run an 
executable after the Google Chrome install/update. This executable was compiled with the name bd.exe 
and was compiled by the threat actor under a project name of 'bd'.  
The 'bd' executable is a remote access trojan (RAT) program that is heavily obfuscated. This program will 
collect basic system information about the infected computer and connect to a web-server that is specified 
when the program is run on the command line, when an appropriate de-obfuscation key is also passed on 
 
  FBI | Treasury | INCDTLP:CLEAR 
Page 10 of 16  |  Product ID: AA24-233A 
TLP:CLEARthe command line. As encoded in this specific MSI package, the de-obfuscation key is '8765' and the web-
server address is 'connect.il-cert.net'. Once the malicious MSI package is run, Google Chrome will be 
installed on the victim computer and then the RAT is executed. This malicious program will check in to the 
web-server and await instructions to be passed to it via responses to the requests 'bd' issues.

Mitigations 
The authoring agencies recommend all organizations implement the mitigations listed below to improve 
their cybersecurity posture based on the Iranian cyber group’s activities.  
These mitigations align with the Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs) developed by CISA 
and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The CPGs provide a minimum set of 
practices and protections that CISA and NIST recommend all organizations implement. CISA and NIST 
based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity frameworks and guidance designed to protect against the most 
common and impactful threats, tactics, techniques, and procedures. Visit CISA’s Cross-Sector 
Cybersecurity Performance Goals  for more information on the CPGs, including additional recommended 
baseline protections. 
The authoring agencies recommend all organizations implement the following mitigations: 
 Closely review any successful authentications to your network or company accounts from Virtual 
Private Network services such as Private Internet Access, Windscribe, ExpressVPN, Urban VPN, and 
NordVPN.  
 If your organization’s information was previously compromised, take appropriate measures to 
ensure security measures are in place to protect against the leveraging of any exfiltrated data to 
conduct further malicious activity against your network. 
 Employ regular updates to applications and the host operating system to ensure protection against 
known vulnerabilities. 
 Establish, and backup offline, a "known good" version of the relevant server and a regular change 
management policy to enable monitoring for alterations to servable content with a file integrity 
system. 
 Employ user input validation to restrict local and remote file inclusion vulnerabilities. 
 Implement a least-privileges policy on the Webserver to: 
o Reduce adversaries’ ability to escalate privileges or pivot laterally to other hosts. 
o Control creation and execution of files in particular directories. 
 
  FBI | Treasury | INCDTLP:CLEAR 
Page 15 of 16  |  Product ID: AA24-233A 
TLP:CLEAR If not already present, consider deploying a demilitarized zone (DMZ) between your organization’s 
Web-facing systems and corporate network. Limiting the interaction and logging traffic between the 
two provide a method to identify possible malicious activity. 
 Consider reputable hosting services for websites and content management systems (CMS), if you 
need assistance in configuring and maintaining your external facing applications. 
 Consider employing a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to block inbound malicious traffic. 
 Review the logs generated by security devices for signs that your organization’s external networks 
are being scanned for vulnerabilities. 
 Ensure a secure configuration of Webservers. All unnecessary services and ports should be 
disabled or blocked. All necessary services and ports should be restricted where feasible. This can 
include whitelisting or blocking external access to administration panels and not using default login 
credentials. 
 Use a reverse proxy or alternative service to restrict accessible URL paths to known legitimate 
ones. 
 Conduct regular system and application vulnerability scans to establish areas of risk. While this 
method does not protect against zero-day attacks, it will highlight possible areas of concern. 
 Disable CMS features if they are not needed, and configure them to: 
 Disable remote file editing 
 Restrict file execution to specific directories 
 Limit login attempts applications. 
 
Validate Security Controls 
In addition to applying mitigations, the authoring agencies recommend exercising, testing, and validating 
your organization's security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK for 
Enterprise framework in this advisory. The authoring agencies recommend testing your existing security 
controls inventory to assess how they perform against the ATT&CK techniques described in this advisory. 
To get started: 
1. Select an ATT&CK technique described in this advisory (see Table 1 to Table ). 
2. Align your security technologies against the technique. 
3. Test your technologies against the technique. 
4. Analyze your detection and prevention technologies’ performance. 
5. Repeat the process for all security technologies to obtain a set of comprehensive performance 
data. 
6. Tune your security program, including people, processes, and technologies, based on the data 
generated by this process.
