COVID-19 Email Phishing Against US Healthcare 
Providers 
Summary 
Following a global increase in malicious cyber activity exploiting fear 
derived from the COVID-19 pandemic, the FBI was notified of targeted 
email phishing attempts against US-based medical providers. These 
attempts leveraged email subject lines and content related to COVID-
19 to distribute malicious attachments, which exploited Microsoft 
Word Document files, 7-zip compressed files, Microsoft Visual Basic 
Script, Java, and Microsoft Executables. The FBI is providing indicators 
of compromise related to these phishing attempts to assist network 
defenders in protecting their environments. Additionally, the FBI is 
providing the attached list of hashes related to additional COVID-19 
phishing. 
 
 
Technical Details 
On 18 March 2020, network perimeter cyber security tools associated 
with US-based medical providers identified email phishing attempts 
from domestic and international IP addresses. The emails contained 
subjects related to the COVID-19 pandemic and included malicious 
files as attachments. These attachments were in the form of Microsoft 
Word Document files, 7-zip compressed files, Microsoft Visual Basic 
Script, Java, and Microsoft Executables. The capabilities of these 
malicious attachments are unknown, but they would have likely 
TLP:WHITE  
TLP:WHITE 
created an initial intrusion vector to enable follow-on system exploitation, persistence, and 
exfiltration.

Information Requested: 
If you or your company are targeted by a phishing campaign, please provide the FBI with a copy of 
the email with the full email header and a copy of any attachments. Please do not open the 
attachment if you or your organization does not have the capability to examine the attachment in a 
controlled and safe manner. Additionally, if you or your company is a victim of a cyber intrusion 
related to email phishing, please retain any logs, image(s) of infected device(s), and memory capture 
of all affected equipment, if possible, to assist in the response by the FBI. 
Recommended Mitigations 
 Be wary of unsolicited attachments, even from people you know. Cyber actors can "spoof" 
the return address, making it look like the message came from a trusted associate.  
 Keep software up to date. Install software patches so that attackers can't take advantage of 
known problems or vulnerabilities. 
 If an email or email attachment seems suspicious, don't open it, even if your antivirus 
software indicates that the message is clean. Attackers are constantly releasing new viruses, 
and the antivirus software might not have the signature.  
 Save and scan any attachments before opening them.  
 Turn off the option to automatically download attachments. To simplify the process of 
reading email, many email programs offer the feature to automatically download 
attachments. Check your settings to see if your software offers the option, and disable it.

TLP:WHITE 
 Consider creating separate accounts on your computer. Most operating systems give you the 
option of creating multiple user accounts with different privileges. Consider reading your 
email on an account with restricted privileges. Some viruses need "administrator" privileges 
to infect a computer. 
 Apply additional security practices. You may be able to filter certain types of attachments 
through your email software or a firewall.
