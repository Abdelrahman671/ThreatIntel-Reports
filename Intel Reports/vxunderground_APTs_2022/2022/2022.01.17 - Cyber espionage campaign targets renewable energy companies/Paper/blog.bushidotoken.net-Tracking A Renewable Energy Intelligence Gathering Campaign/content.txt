Tracking A Renewable Energy Intelligence Gathering Campaign
blog.bushidotoken.net/2022/01/tracking-renewable-energy-intelligence.html
 
For my first research blog of 2022, I analysed a suspected intelligence gathering campaign targeting
renewable energy and industrial technology organisations, with a particular focus on Bulgaria. This long-
running espionage campaign leveraged multiple credential harvesting pages to target the email accounts
of employees at a number of organisations between 2019 and is ongoing in 2022. The attackers use the
same 'Mail Box' phishing kit and host many of the pages on them infrastructure, supported by also
compromising some legitimate websites.
This research was conducted using OSINT techniques such as query public sandbox submissions and
passive DNS scan results. From this up to 40 individuals at target organisations from a variety of
sectors were identified, but there was a focus on a few such as renewable energy, environmental
protection organisations, and industrial technology. This research using OSINT alone is unable to acquire
the full story, but hopefully can paint a picture of the motivation of the adversary behind this campaign.
Some of the targets include high-profile organisations such as operational technology (OT) and industrial
control system (ICS) vendors like Schneider Electric and Honeywell, as well as Chinese
telecommunications giant Huawei, semiconductor manufacturer HiSilicon, Telekom Romania, and US
universities such as the University of Wisconsin, California State University, and Utah State University.
2/7
As mentioned above, one of the focuses of the campaign appeared to be renewable energy and
environmental protection organisations. This includes the Kardzhali Hydroelectric Power Station
(vec[.]nek[.]bg) and CEZ Electro (cez[.]bg), both located in Bulgaria, as well as the California Air
Resources Board (arb[.]ca[.]gov), Morris County Municipal Utilities Authority (mcmua[.]com), the Taiwan
Forestry Research Institute (tfri[.]gov[.]tw), the Carbon Disclosure Program (cdp[.]net), and Sorema, an
Italian plastic recycling firm. There was also a small cluster of activty in 2019 linked to the same
infrastructure targeting multiple banks in Bulgaria too.

Analysis
4/7
This campaign was linked via its use of a custom 'Mail Box' phishing kit which simply collects the
password of any user that visits it. The majority of the phishing pages have been hosted on *.eu3[.]biz,
*.eu3[.]org, *.eu5[.]net hostnames (all owned by Zetta Hosting Solutions, AS44476). Some of the phishing
pages were hosted on compromised websites, several of them located in Brazil (*.com[.]br). Many of the
domains used by the adversary include phrases such as "update", "activate", or "support" and use the "-"
multiple times.
 
The Mail Box phishing kit looks very generic and unsophisticated. The lures that lead to these credential
harvesting pages were never recovered during this research. However, from visiting the second stage of
the kit, the lures are likely using a generic "Your Mail Box storage is full" style phishing email. The landing
page for this kit was always called "index.php" and the target's email address is appended to the end of
the phishing URL.
Attribution
Two clusters of activity did overlap with some of the campaign artefacts. This includes campaigns
attributed to two advanced persistent threat (APT) groups: APT28 (also known as FancyBear and
attributed to the Russian GRU) and Konni (a group linked to the North Korean RGB). On 14 January
2022, Google TAG researchers disclosed several hostnames that use the same infrastructure as this
campaign. The APT28 hostnames used to phish the credentials of users in Ukraine also used "eu3[.]biz"
hostnames and Zetta Hosting Solutions (AS44476). It is currently unknown, however, whether the 'Mail
Box' phishing kit was used and the domains lack the use of the "-" multiple times. On 3 January 2022,
Cluster25 disclosed a Konni RAT campaign targeting Russian diplomats also using Zetta Hosting
Solutions (AS44476) for command and control (C2) domains. However, the Konni RAT used "c1[.]biz"
instead of the other main three hostnames that were observed in this campaign. Based on these links
alone, however, it would not be sufficient to say this campaign is connected to either APT. [1, 2]
 
Attribution using these campaign artefacts and OSINT reports alone was not possible. However, it can be
inferred that the adversary behind these attempts appears to be interested in Bulgaria, for starters, plus
critical infrastructure, renewable energy, environmental protection agencies, and recycling technology.
Supplemental targets such as ICS/OT organisations and educational institutions would compliment this
intelligence gathering campaign, if access could be obtained at these entities. From this it could be
suggested that the adversary behind this campaign is potentially a major source of fossil fuels and is
doing research on the renewable energy sector as a threat to its income.
