The distinctive rattle of APT SideWinder
Introduction
In February 2023, Group-IB’s Threat Intelligence team released a technical report about previously unknown phishing
attacks conducted by the APT group SideWinder: Old Snake, New Skin: Analysis of SideWinder APT activity
between June and November 2021. As always, Group-IB customers and partners were the first to get access to the
report through the interface of Group-IB’s Threat Intelligence platform.
One of them was Bridewell, a leading cyber security services company based in the UK and a long-standing MSSP
partner of Group-IB in Europe. Our colleagues from Bridewell have been using Group-IB’s Threat Intelligence, Digital
Risk Protection, and Attack Surface Management solutions to support the cybersecurity services they offer to its
customers.
Bridewell’s in-house threat intelligence experts read Group-IB’s report on SideWinder and came up with their own
significant findings about SideWinder. The Bridewell team shared this information with our Threat Intelligence unit,
which led to this joint blog post. By bringing together the research capabilities of both companies, we developed and
described new hunting methods so that we could track one of the most prolific APT groups more efficiently.
Group-IB and Bridewell’s joint research describes how to use publicly available tools to monitor known SideWinder
infrastructure and reveals new malicious servers that could be used in future attacks.
This blog post provides details of previously unknown infrastructure belonging to APT SideWinder. In addition,
Group-IB and Bridewell researchers share hunting rules for Shodan to help cybersecurity specialists, threat hunters,
and corporate cybersecurity teams pre-empt and prevent SideWinder attacks.
Join the Cybercrime Fighters Club
The global fight against cybercrime is a collaborative effort, and that’s why we’re looking to partner with industry peers
to research emerging threats and publish joint findings on our blog. If you’ve discovered a breakthrough into a
particular threat actor or a vulnerability in a piece of software, let us know at blog@group-ib.com, and we can
mobilize all our necessary resources to dive deeper into the issue. All contributions will be given appropriate credit
along with the full backing of our social media team on Group-IB’s Threat Intelligence Twitter page, where we
regularly share our latest findings into threat actors’ TTPs and infrastructure, along with our other social media
accounts.
Acknowledgements: We would like to thank Dmitry Kupin for contributing to this blog post.

Key findings
SideWinder’s servers can be detected using several hunting rules described in this blog post.
Group-IB and Bridewell detected 55 previously unknown IP addresses that SideWinder could use in future
attacks.
The identified phishing domains mimic various organizations in the news, government, telecommunications,
and financial sectors.
SideWinder uses the identified servers as A records for domains that mimic government organizations in
Pakistan, China, and India. These domains are listed in the “Who are SideWinder’s potential targets?” section
of this blog post.
We discovered an APK sample for Android devices. The sample is similar to one mentioned in Group-IB’s
blog post SideWinder.AntiBot.Script.
Tracking SideWinder’s infrastructure
Description of hunting rules
For several years, SideWinder has been using a unique method of deploying and maintaining its malicious servers.
The APT’s infrastructure is distinct in that servers always return a response with the 404 status code and the Not
Found content when the root page is accessed.
3/29
Malicious content is returned only if the victim follows a special link received through either phishing emails or
phishing posts on social media (for example in dedicated Facebook groups). SideWinder’s network infrastructure can
be tracked using the search engines Shodan and Censys if unique parameters are set correctly.
Our research focuses on 119 IP addresses, which can be divided into two categories: the first one comprises the
APT’s known IP addresses, while the second category covers the group’s IP addresses that have not been publicly
revealed before. A table with all network indicators can be found at the end of this blog post.
Shodan hunting rules
SideWinder’s infrastructure can be tracked by using the hunting rules described below in Shodan. We describe
infrastructure links based on these queries.
ssl.jarm:"3fd3fd0003fd3fd21c3fd3fd3fd3fd703dc1bf20eb9604decefea997eabff7" HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found Server:

Using these hunting rules, Group-IB and Bridewell specialists discovered 119 IP addresses that they attributed to
SideWinder, 64 of which were either known to us or mentioned in public descriptions of the group’s attacks. The other
55 IP addresses belonging to SideWinder have not been described before.
Known IP addresses
Based on the data obtained using the hunting rules, the following IP addresses and domains were identified. These
are publicly known addresses used by SideWinder and are mentioned here to show that the hunting rules used are
accurate.

226617
Analysis of the group’s infrastructure by Bridewell specialists revealed a malicious APK file, 226617, which was
uploaded to VirusTotal on March 23, 2023 at 09:34:02 UTC from Sri Lanka (the city of Colombo, source: the Web).
The Group-IB team analyzed the sample.
The APK file 226617 is an Android application disguised as the game Ludo.
17/29
18/29
19/29
The application is a downloader type of malware that downloads the encrypted payload at hxxps://games[.]srv-
app[.]co/669/1/1970/2/0/0/1764305594/2X1R9Tw7c5eSvLpCCwnl0X7C0zhfHLA6RJzJ0ADS/files-
82dfc144/appxed. The payload is a DEX file, launched using the class DexClassLoader.
20/29
The link is Base64-encoded and encrypted using the AES-256 ECB algorithm with the key {7e 51 73 44 54 49 ac a1
fe 99 25 f3 25 29 58 e3 5a 45 7c cd 89 d4 87 78 34 3f b2 df c2 60 2c 21} (32 bytes).
Example of the link decrypted in CyberChef:
In addition, the malware has an autostart functionality when the targeted mobile device loads. It is worth noting that
the application partially matches and has similar functionalities to the code of the application Secure
VPN_3.9_apkcombo.com.apk (SHA-1: c6effe7fcd87f643aebc427e127dd7b00865eafd), which was discovered by
Group-IB Threat Intelligence experts in as early as 2021.

Hosting infrastructure
This graph shows the distribution of malicious domains by hosting service provider, for providers known to be used by
SideWinder.
SideWinder often registers domains whose URL addresses mimic various organizations in Pakistan and China. In
June 2022, Group-IB specialists published a blog post (SideWinder.AntiBot.Script) in which they described the
group’s resources whose URLs mimic Pakistani organizations. It is worth noting that website contents are sometimes
drastically different from what the name suggests.
Who are SideWinder’s potential targets?
The domains discovered by Bridewell and Group-IB specialists suggest that SideWinder could have planned attacks
against financial and government organizations, as well as companies specialized in e-commerce and mass media in
Pakistan and China.

Group-IB has notified relevant organizations in Pakistan and China about the domains indicated  above.
Conclusion
SideWinder is among the most active and prolific threat actors out there. According to Group-IB, between June and
November 2021 the group may have targeted as many as 61 organizations in Asia. 
While investigating the threat actors, Group-IB’s and Bridewell’s threat intelligence specialists identified and attributed
a large part of the group’s infrastructure, namely 55 domains and IP addresses. In addition, our analysis revealed
phishing domains imitating news, finance, media, government, and telecommunications companies.
A close look at the infrastructure used by any group will almost always help with writing hunting rules that can be then
used to learn about that group’s attacks in the making and respond to them preemptively. The network indicators
provided in this blog post can be used to protect against SideWinder proactively and to search for new infrastructure
used by the group.
Like many other APT groups, SideWinder relies on targeted spear phishing as the initial vector. It is therefore
important for organizations to deploy business email protection solutions that detonate malicious content.
To enrich indicators of compromise and stay up to date with relevant threats, it is more effective to use threat
intelligence solutions.
If your company’s specialists analyze the activity of this or any other APT group, we would be happy to conduct a
joint analysis and publish it on our blog.
