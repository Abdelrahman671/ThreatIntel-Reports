CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS
Analysis cut-off date: July 25, 2024
Executive Summary
Insikt Group has identified a highly agile and adaptable cybercriminal group operating under the
moniker “Marko Polo”. Our research has resulted in three previous public-facing Insikt Group reports (1,
2, 3). Marko Polo, which primarily operates on social media, has developed a sophisticated network of
scams — using information stealer malware (“infostealers”; “stealware”) to target individuals and
organizations worldwide — often impersonating legitimate brands in online gaming, virtual meeting and
productivity software, and cryptocurrency. Following Insikt Group investigations into other projects
attributed to Marko Polo, like Astration and Vortax, Insikt Group analysis has uncovered over 30 new
and distinct scams, 50 unique malware payloads, dozens of malicious domains, and hundreds of
fraudulent social media accounts linked to the Marko Polo operation. Insikt Group assesses that Marko
Polo is actively expanding and diversifying its efforts, leading to an increase in the volume and cadence
of attributed scams; however, this tempo results in greater public visibility, researcher attention, and
operational security risks for Marko Polo.
Based on the widespread nature of the Marko Polo campaign, Insikt Group suspects that likely tens of
thousands of devices have been compromised globally — exposing sensitive personal and corporate
data. This poses significant risks to both consumer privacy and business continuity. Almost certainly
generating millions of dollars in illicit revenue, this operation also highlights the negative economic
effects of such cybercriminal activities. Insikt Group also notes that the primary targets of the scams
identified in this report — online gaming personalities, cryptocurrency influencers, and technology
professionals — are usually considered to be more technologically savvy, with better cybersecurity
hygiene, than the average internet user. Despite this, these users are still susceptible to Marko Polo
scams — indicating both the maturity of such scams and the broader effectiveness of social
engineering as an attack vector. Individuals and enterprises may face direct financial losses, increased
insurance costs, and reputational damage from breaches attributed to Marko Polo scams.
Marko Polo’s ability to pivot across different platforms and adapt its campaigns makes it a persistent
criminal threat. This adaptability requires individuals and businesses to cast a much wider net, investing
in more proactive cybersecurity strategies that address the underlying threats posed by Marko Polo —
such as social engineering and infostealer malware. The relative success of operations like Marko Polo
underscores the evolving nature of cyber threats. For executives and observers alike, this highlights the
need for robust security controls that limit a user’s exposure to infection. Businesses should ensure that
employees are only downloading approved software — especially for meetings and productivity, as
outlined in this report.
The Marko Polo operation represents a significant and ongoing risk to both individual consumers and
businesses worldwide. Its adaptability, reach, and financial success make it a prime example of the
evolving threat landscape that requires continuous vigilance and investment in advanced security
measures.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS
Key Findings
●
Over 30 Unique Social Media Scams Identified: Insikt Group has uncovered more than 30
distinct social media scams attributed to Marko Polo, in addition to over 20 compromised Zoom
meeting software builds, software cracks, and poisoned torrent downloads. These scams
represent a significant threat to both individual users and businesses as many of them are still
active, as of this writing.
●
Spearphishing Targeting Cryptocurrency Users and Influencers: Marko Polo has been
leveraging spearphishing tactics on social media to specifically target cryptocurrency users and
influencers, leading to major financial losses. This highlights the group’s focus on high-value
targets within the digital finance sector.
●
Diversified Malware Toolkit: Marko Polo employs a wide range of malware, including
HijackLoader, Stealc, Rhadamanthys, and Atomic macOS Stealer (AMOS), demonstrating its
ability to adapt and diversify its attack methods in cross-platform attacks. This variety makes it a
versatile and persistent threat.
●
Reach and Impact: Marko Polo’s operations have likely compromised tens of thousands of
devices worldwide, resulting in millions of dollars in illicit revenue. The group’s ability to operate
on such a large scale poses a serious risk to both personal data security and corporate integrity.
●
Increased Risk to Businesses and Consumers Alike: The proliferation of Marko Polo’s scams
and malware means that both average internet users and enterprises are at risk. Consumers
could face identity theft and financial losses, while businesses face potential data breaches,
reputational damage, and financial effects.
●
Long-term Implications: The adaptability and resilience of the Marko Polo operation underline
the need for continuous vigilance and advanced security measures. Both individuals and
organizations must prioritize cybersecurity awareness and defenses to protect against this
evolving threat landscape.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS
Background
Insikt Group has been tracking a series of interconnected scams on social media for approximately six
months. These scams are diverse in nature, impersonating Web3 projects, massively multiplayer online
(MMO) games, productivity software, virtual meeting software, and more. Over the course of several
investigations, Insikt Group is confident in its clustering and attributions of said scams to a single threat
actor, dubbed Marko Polo. Insikt Group assesses that Marko Polo primarily leverages spearphishing on
social media to proliferate its scams. Marko Polo explicitly targets cryptocurrency users, resulting in
major financial losses. Insikt Group has identified scam reports indicating that Marko Polo operators
have stolen victims' life savings.
Insikt Group identified a series of posts on dark web and special-access sources suggesting that Marko
Polo is a financially motivated “traffer team”. Traffer teams are groups of organized individuals who
redirect victims' traffic to malicious content operated by other threat actors. Marko Polo is only one
active traffer team among dozens in the cybercriminal underground, demonstrating the scale of this
ecosystem. Marko Polo is a primarily Russian-, Ukrainian-, and English-speaking group, with
administrators and operators likely located in the post-Soviet states.

Scams Attributed to Marko Polo
PartyWorld and Party Royale (MP-1)
PartyWorld is a self-proclaimed free-to-play “lootr shootr” online video game that primarily
impersonates legitimate games — including Fortnite and Party Icon — and is marketed via social media
(@PartyWorldOGIX). Insikt Group first identified PartyWorld in June 2024 via social media reports of
cryptocurrency scamming and infostealer malware delivery. Insikt Group assesses that PartyWorld is
almost certainly a rebrand of Party Royale (@PartyRoyaleOGX) — a previous scam linked to Marko
Polo. PartyWorld is boosted by Marko Polo operators that control fake social media accounts —
purchased in bulk or harvested from the victims of account takeover (ATO) fraud.
Figure 2: Marko Polo infection chain (Source: Recorded Future)
Marko Polo operations follow a distinct infection chain to lure victims that generally begins with
engagements via direct messages on various social media and NFT platforms, such as Discord and
OpenSea. When approaching a potential victim, the operator, typically acting in the capacity of a human
resources or talent acquisition representative, attempts to lure the user with a job opportunity, directing
the user to go to the malicious website and obtain the project’s software. In this case, upon visiting the
PartyWorld website — partyworld[.]io — users are prompted to download the PartyWorld client for
either Windows OS or macOS. For Windows OS users, the PartyWorld website contacts Dropbox
(dropbox[.]com/scl/fi/rqnd52uvolzt7t4ayefki/PartyWorld.exe?rlkey=v79iq914kkosuacpk
yyio3pzs&st=b4m0fnx7&dl=1) to download the PartyWorld.exe client.
For macOS users, the PartyWorld website contacts ask-ashika[.]com to download the
PartySetup.dmg installation file. In mid-July 2024, the PartyWorld macOS build was moved from
ask-ashika[.]com to punitrai[.]com. On or around July 25, 2024, the PartyWorld macOS build was yet
again moved to rafaelsuarezlopez[.]com. Insikt Group notes that rafaelsuarezlopez[.]com is hosted on a
different IP address than the previous two download locations, suggesting that Marko Polo is actively
pivoting its infrastructure to avoid long-term tracking. This pivot may be related to ongoing reports of

service disruptions to bulletproof hosting (BPH) services preferred by Marko Polo operators, such as
SUNHOST (AS216319) and AEZA (AS210644).
As seen in Table 2, the Windows OS build of PartyWorld delivers HijackLoader, Stealc, and
Rhadamanthys. For macOS, PartyWorld delivers AMOS.

has clustered the PartyWorld scam as MP-1.
Pivoting from the IP address associated with ask-ashika[.]com and punitrai[.]com (77.91.77[.]175), Insikt
Group identified a second suspicious domain that also delivers an AMOS build of PartyWorld
(wealthgenixs[.]com), which contacts the above AMOS C2. This finding allowed Insikt Group to pivot to
other domains hosted on the same IP address, uncovering dozens of domains that deliver payloads
related to other Marko Polo scams, beginning with Vorion.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS
Vorion, Vortax, and Vixcall (MP-2)
Vorion was a rebrand of the Vortax meeting software scam, which was the primary subject of a June
17, 2024, Insikt Group report. As with Vortax, Vorion (@vorionai) was an infostealer payload disguised
as a self-proclaimed virtual meeting software that largely spread on social media via spearphishing. The
Marko Polo operators assigned to Vorion focused their targeting efforts on cryptocurrency influencers
— impersonating legitimate Web3 projects and engaging influencers directly with nonexistent job
offers. The operators would persuade the target to download Vorion via vorion[.]io. The operators
would also provide the target with a “Room ID” — similar to the Vortax scam — which would unlock the
payload download on the Vorion website. Insikt Group identified several victims of Vorion. In mid-June
2024, Marko Polo likely abandoned the Vorion scam.
According to Recorded Future Malware Intelligence, the most recent AMOS build (Recorded Future
Malware Intelligence Data) of Vorion (VorionLauncher.dmg) was hosted on hoskinmetrologie[.]com
and contacted the 147.45.43[.]136 AMOS C2 at the /joinsystem endpoint. Insikt Group was not able to
procure a Windows OS build of Vorion at the time of writing, as the project had been deprecated.
However, Insikt Group believes that the Vorion Windows OS payloads are likely Stealc and
Rhadamanthys, similar to Vortax.
On July 24, 2024, Insikt Group identified that Vorion had yet again rebranded to Vixcall (@VixcallApp).
The website for Vixcall — vixcall[.]app — shares the same design as Vortax and Vorion, including
requiring a Room ID to procure the Windows OS and macOS Vixcall downloads.

Insikt Group notes that previous macOS downloads for Vortax (VortaxSetup.dmg) and Vorion
(VorionLauncher.dmg) were previously hosted at plumbonwater[.]com, but pivoted to new hosting
infrastructure following Insikt Group identification in June 2024. These previous builds, prior to
implementing multipart/form-data encoding in its C2 POST requests, used the plaintext build ID vor.
Based on this build ID, among other indicators, Insikt Group clustered the Vortax and Vorion scams as
MP-2.

Insikt Group further investigated the hosting infrastructure, structure, artifacts, and design of the Vixcall
website and uncovered a possibly related scam called PDFUnity. According to its website —
pdfunity[.]com — PDFUnity is a self-proclaimed enterprise-focused productivity software. As of July
24, 2024, the PDFUnity website is offline; therefore, Insikt Group is unable to procure downloads and
make an attribution to MP-2. However, based on several unique cascading style sheets (CSS) and
scalable vector graphics (SVG) artifacts found on the Vortax, Vorion, Vixcall, and PDFUnity websites,
Insikt Group believes that they are related.

VDeck, VMSphere, VmMeetHub, and VmAxis (MP-3)
VDeck, similar to Vortax, is a self-proclaimed meeting software that is primarily spread on social media
(@VDeck_app) via spearphishing. The operators assigned to VDeck focus their targeting efforts on
cryptocurrency influencers, impersonating legitimate Web3 projects and engaging influencers directly
with fraudulent job offers. The operators would persuade the target to download VDeck via vdeck[.]io
or vdeck[.]app. The operators would also provide the target with a “Room ID” — similar to the Vortax
scam — which would unlock the download on the VDeck website. Insikt Group found several Room IDs
in scam reports on social media — including VDAMA29583 and VDF157MA, among others — but all were
inactive. However, unlike Vortax, Vorion, Vixcall, and other Marko Polo scams, the VDeck website allows
visitors to create their own Room ID — allowing Insikt Group to bypass these roadblocks and procure
VDeck downloads for both Windows OS and macOS.

Insikt Group believes that MP-3 is attempting to avoid researcher attention by locking VMSphere,
VmMeetHub, and VmAxis downloads behind Room IDs, given the relative ease of bypassing such a
requirement for VDeck. These Room IDs — differing from Vortax, which were permanently set keys —
are now temporary in nature, set by the operator, and linked to a specific target. All of the Room IDs
identified by Insikt Group on social media are now invalid.
Further investigation into the domains listed in Table 9 revealed connections to another Marko Polo
scam — Voico. Voico is discussed at length below, along with related scams such as Callzy, GoHeard,
Up-Connect, and Vicall, all of which Insikt Group has attributed to MP-3.

Insikt Group discovered five additional scams linked to Up-Connect and GoHeard: Yous, WooSpeech,
Vicall, Voico, and Callzy.
The Yous scam was likely only operated for a short period of time, maintaining only one domain —
yous[.]ai — which was first identified in September 2022. It is unclear when the domain went offline,
but it is currently defunct. The WooSpeech scam was also short-lived, with its website —
woospeech[.]top — only existing from March 17 to March 19, 2024. This implies that Yous and
WooSpeech could have served as testing for MP-3 before MP-3 pivoted to longer-term operations.
Insikt Group believes that MP-3 pivoted its operations to focus on three recent scams, which were
primarily spread via social media: Vicall (@VicallApp), Voico, and Callzy (@AppCallzy). Voico was the
only scam without a dedicated social media account, using the @AppCallzy handle instead.

Table 14: Callzy website infrastructure (Source: Recorded Future Data)
As of July 24, 2024, Insikt Group believes that the Vicall scam was abandoned by MP-3 in mid-July
2024, with Marko Polo instead opting to pursue Voico and Callzy full-time. In addition to the original
77.91.77[.]175 IP address first identified in the PartyWorld scam, Insikt Group discovered two active
Marko Polo domains that deliver AMOS builds named after the Voico and Callzy scams (Table 15).
These AMOS builds communicate with known Marko Polo AMOS C2s. Based on this finding, in addition
to all of the evidence presented above, Insikt Group can definitively assess that Up-Connect, GoHeard,
Yous, WooSpeech, Voico, Vicall, and Callzy are all linked to Marko Polo.

NightVerse (MP-4)
NightVerse is a self-proclaimed “cyberpunk” Web3 metaverse game that is primarily active on social
media (@nightversegame), Telegram (@NightverseGame), and Discord. Cyberpunk genre games
incorporate technological and scientific concepts into a dystopian future landscape. As of July 24,
2024, NightVerse claims to be “launching soon” on its official website — nightverse[.]game (Intelligence
Card). NightVerse does not currently have a client available for download; however, Insikt Group was
still able to identify two NightVerse AMOS builds currently hosted on domains linked to Marko Polo.
These two builds contact different AMOS C2 domains.

(Source: Recorded Future Data)
Insikt Group notes that one AMOS build (NightVerseSetup.dmg) in Table 16 was previously hosted at
faruvinnovations[.]com. This previous build, prior to implementing multipart/form-data encoding in its
C2 POST requests, used the plaintext build ID NIGHT and communicated with the AMOS C2
77.221.151[.]54. Based on these indicators, Insikt Group has clustered NightVerse as MP-4.
Further investigation of nightverse[.]game revealed possible connections to another website,
gamepilot[.]ai (Figure 8). As of July 24, 2024, the latter is offline; therefore, Insikt Group is unable to
make a determination as to the nature of these connections and whether gamepilot[.]ai delivered AMOS
at any point.

Nortex (MP-4)
Nortex (@NortexLab) is a self-proclaimed “decentralized all-in-one application for Web3 maximalists”
that allegedly functions as a messaging service, productivity software, social network, and more —
impersonating the legitimate Web3 project SendingMe (sending[.]me). In reality, Nortex does not
perform any of these functions. Upon visiting its website — nortexapp[.]xyz — Nortex downloads a
client for either Windows OS or macOS. On Windows OS, Nortex delivers HijackLoader and Stealc,
whereas it delivers AMOS on macOS. Similar to VDeck and Vortax, the Windows OS build of Nortex is
downloaded via Dropbox and pulls its configurations from showpiecekennelmating[.]com. The macOS
build of Nortex pulls its download from allieat[.]com, which is hosted on the same IP address
(77.91.77[.]175) linked to all of the scams above. The macOS build communicates with a known Marko
Polo AMOS C2.

build ID sneprivate and communicated with the AMOS C2 IP address 77.221.151[.]54. This build
resembles the Telegram handle and common abbreviation of Marko Polo subteam Slavic Nation (“sne”;
“sneland”); therefore, Insikt Group has attributed Nortex to MP-4. Based on the additional shared use of
the night build ID, which overlaps with NightVerse, Insikt Group can also tentatively attribute
NightVerse to MP-4.

Rune Online (MP-5)
Rune Online is a self-proclaimed Web3 massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) that
impersonates legitimate games, including RuneScape and Rise Online World. Rune Online has a
significant social media presence relative to other Marko Polo scams. Rune Online maintains accounts
on LinkedIn (Rune Online), social media (@RuneMMORPG), Instagram (@runeonlineworld), and a
Discord server (discord[.]gg/runeonline). Rune Online also claims to operate a Twitch channel
(twitch[.]com/riseonlineworld), but this is the legitimate account for Rise Online World.
Upon visiting the Rune Online website — runeonlineworld[.]io — users are prompted to download the
Rune Online client for either Windows OS or macOS. Similarly to VDeck, the Rune Online Windows OS
build is retrieved from Dropbox
(dropbox[.]com/scl/fi/wcl6nos8lteixi75fbm73/RuneOnlineWorld.exe?rlkey=mtt6ewrq4r2o

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS
Mitigations
●
Enhance Endpoint Protection: Deploy advanced endpoint detection and response (EDR)
solutions to monitor for and block the execution of known malware families associated with
Marko Polo — such as HijackLoader, Stealc, Rhadamanthys, and AMOS. These specific tools, in
combination with social media scams, are immediate indicators of a Marko Polo attack.
●
Web Filtering and Monitoring: Deploy web filtering solutions to block access to known malicious
domains linked to Marko Polo — including all of the domains listed in this report — as well as
suspicious downloads, especially those related to cracked “freemium” software.
●
Network Segmentation: Apply network segmentation to limit the spread of malware and reduce
the impact of initial access. Segment high-value assets, such as systems storing financial data
or intellectual property, to prevent lateral movement.
●
Behavioral Analysis: Use behavioral analysis tools to detect unusual activities, such as
unexpected file downloads, command execution, or connections to suspicious IP addresses
flagged in this report.
●
Continuous Threat Intelligence Monitoring: Regularly update threat intelligence feeds with the
latest indicators of compromise (IoCs) related to Marko Polo. Ensure that security teams are
aware of the latest TTPs employed by the group.
●
User Awareness and Training: Implement ongoing cybersecurity awareness training for
employees, emphasizing the risks associated with phishing, social engineering, and suspicious
downloads. Include specific modules on the risks posed by cryptocurrency-targeted attacks
leveraged by Marko Polo.
●
Incident Response Planning: Develop and regularly update incident response plans, ensuring
they include scenarios involving initial access brokers. Conduct tabletop exercises to simulate
potential Marko Polo-style attacks.
●
Collaboration and Information Sharing: Collaborate with industry peers, threat intelligence
organizations, and law enforcement agencies to share information on Marko Polo and similar
threats. Engage in cross-sector initiatives to improve collective defenses against advanced
cybercriminal groups.
●
Supply-Chain Security: Strengthen supply-chain security by assessing the cybersecurity
posture of partners and vendors. Ensure that third-party relationships do not introduce
vulnerabilities, especially given Marko Polo’s ability to pivot quickly across different attack
vectors.
●
Strategic Threat Modeling: Regularly update threat models to account for evolving tactics used
by Marko Polo. Incorporate long-term scenarios in which the group continues to rebrand,
diversify its attack methods, and collaborate with other threat actors. Plan for the potential
escalation of the group’s activities, including more sophisticated and targeted attacks.
●
Enhanced Regulatory Compliance: Stay ahead of evolving regulatory requirements related to
data protection and cybersecurity. Ensure that your organization’s practices align with both
domestic and international standards, particularly in industries like finance, where Marko Polo’s
attacks could have severe consequences.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS
●
Recorded Future: Insikt Group recommends using Recorded Future Malware Intelligence to
identify build IDs, C2 infrastructure, staging domains, and other malicious indicators associated
with the Marko Polo scams described above. Leveraging Recorded Future Malware Intelligence
and Recorded Future Network Intelligence can better identify and cluster infostealer activity,
providing initial indications of infections, victimology, and pivoting scams. Insikt Group also
recommends leveraging Recorded Future Identity Intelligence to ensure that organizations are
not victimized by information stolen as part of a Marko Polo scam. Leveraging all of these tools,
in combination with signatures for the malware outlined in this report, like AMOS, will provide
coverage against Marko Polo.
Outlook
Insikt Group assesses that the Marko Polo cybercriminal group will almost certainly continue to be
highly reactive, adaptive, and resilient in the face of potential disruptions. Marko Polo has demonstrated
an exceptional ability to pivot quickly when detected by researchers, frequently rebranding and
renaming its scams, updating its hosting infrastructure, and shifting tactics to evade scrutiny. This
adaptability not only makes Marko Polo a persistent threat but also signals that it will likely continue
evolving its methods to stay ahead of cybersecurity defenses.
For average internet users, this means an increased risk of exposure to well-crafted, sophisticated
scams — especially those involved in cryptocurrency. Marko Polo’s use of spearphishing, drive-by
compromise, and watering hole attacks indicates that even the most cautious users could be vulnerable
to infostealer infection and subsequent cryptocurrency theft. As traditional indicators of phishing and
scams become less reliable — due to Marko Polo’s continuous rebranding — users will need to remain
vigilant and skeptical of unexpected communications, even from seemingly legitimate sources.
For enterprises, the implications are equally significant. Marko Polo’s likely role as an initial access
broker suggests a growing risk to corporate networks. Logs and access credentials harvested from
initial attacks could be sold to other threat actors, leading to further breaches, ransomware attacks, or
data exfiltration. This poses a long-term threat to corporate security, particularly if preventative
measures are not continuously updated. The group’s resilience and adaptability also mean that
enterprises must prepare for a continuously evolving threat landscape. Advanced threat detection,
response capabilities, and ongoing cybersecurity training for employees will be critical to defending
against this threat.
Strategically, both individuals and organizations alike should prioritize continuous monitoring and
leverage threat intelligence to stay informed about Marko Polo’s activities. Proactive identification of
evolving tactics will be key to mitigating risks. The ongoing threat posed by groups like Marko Polo
underscores the importance of collaboration between public and private sectors to enhance the
collective defense against such adaptable adversaries.
Marko Polo represents a long-term, evolving threat to both individual users and enterprises. The group’s
adaptability, combined with its likely role as an initial access broker, implies that its operations will

continue to pose significant risks. Proactive cybersecurity strategies and continuous vigilance will be
essential to defend against the ongoing and future activities of this agile threat actor.
