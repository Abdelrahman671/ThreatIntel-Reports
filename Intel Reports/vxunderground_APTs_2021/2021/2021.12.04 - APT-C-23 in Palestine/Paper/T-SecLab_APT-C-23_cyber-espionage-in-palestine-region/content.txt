Company Name page # 2
In the daily threat hunting, we found a very interesting thing. We hunted a 
“Raw Threat Intelligence.docx” file. We found the “Commander 
Mohammed Dahlan and The Egyptian Intelligence Meeting (MoM) 
Leakage( الـــمصريـــه-الـــمخابـــرات-و-دحـــالن-محـــمد-الــقائــد-اجــــتماع-تســريــب)” file. This 
file contains link for downloading the APK File. You can find jeosandbox’s 
result in the link. After in-depth analysis, we found that the cyber 
espionage targeted Palestinian region. In addition, we discovered the 
APT-C-23 attack. 
WEAPONS ANALYSIS SUMMARY 
By analyzing the downloaded samples, we get the C2 server(kh.njrat.info).  
Using pivoting analysis, we hunted different types of samples, such as PE, VBS, 
APK, Python.
