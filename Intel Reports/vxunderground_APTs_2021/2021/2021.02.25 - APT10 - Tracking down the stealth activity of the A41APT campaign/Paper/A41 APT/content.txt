１．A41APT Campaign Overview
A41APT Campaign Overview
�Period of Activity: March 2019 to January 2021
�Target: Japan (Japanese companies including overseas branches)
�Infection Vector: SSL-VPN abuse (Could not observed spear-phishing)
�Implants: DESLoader, SodaMaster, P8RAT and FYAntiLoader etc.
�Characteristics: Very tough to detect attacker’s intrusion

We call this threat campaign A41APT from the hostname feature 
“DESKTOP-A41UVJV” that is continuously used during the initial intrusion.

３．Characteristics of Intrusion
Intrusion method in A41APT campaign
25
Scheduled task registration
AD Server
C2 Server
DESLoader
Payload
In Memory
Legitimate PE
OR
PowerShell
Server
Event log deletion
Credential
Dumping
Server*
Laptop
・・・
Penetration via SSL-VPN 
using vulnerabilities or stolen 
credentials
Initial Intrusion
Internal Recon.
Lateral Movement
Persistence of 
malware
C2
Communication
Trace Removal
Perform a port scan to search 
for open RDP or SMB port. 
Then, connect to RDP with an 
administrator account.
Persistence by scheduled task 
registration to execute the 
legitimate PE
Communicate with C2 server 
via DESLoader’s payload or 
PowerShell remoting
Delete the event log after 
communication with C2 is 
finished.
*We have also observed cases where traces have been removed from other compromised servers as well.
・・・
Characteristics of Compromise
1. Initial intrusion using SSL-VPN products
2. Network scanning and credential theft
3. PowerShell remoting to remove event logs
4. Persistence of malware by scheduled task
26
３-１．Initial intrusion via SSL-VPN (e.g. session hijacking)
27
•
In October 2019, an attacker used the hostname DESKTOP-A41UVJV to hijack sessions to 
enter the internal network via SSL-VPN product, Pulse Secure.
•
JPCERT also reported a similar attack targeting SSL-VPN [4].
•
In some cases, attackers used credentials that they had stolen in the past intrusion.
３-2．Network scanning and credential theft
28
▪After the intrusion by SSL-VPN, perform 
internal network scanning to find open port 
RDP (3389/TCP) and SMB (445/TCP).
▪
Use an administrator account to deploy RDP 
to servers with free RDP.
e.g. server types that are frequently 
compromised by RDP
AD server
File server
Anti Virus management server 
Backup server
Print server
FAX server
Network scanning and RDP
Credential theft
▪Run csvde.exe, a CSV export command line 
tool provided by Microsoft.
▪Execute AdFind provided by joeware.
▪Dump of SYSTEM/SECURITY/SAM hive, etc.
https://www.joeware.net/freetools/tools/adfind/
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-
pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/cc732101(v=ws.11)
３-3．PowerShell remoting to delete event logs
29
•
Event log: the end of a PowerShell 
remoting session
•
Windows PowerShell.evtx
EID: 403
•
The "C2 address" and the "*.nls file 
name" are changed, but the rest is the 
same
⇒probably common tools execution
３-４．Persistence of malware by scheduled task
30
▪Registered a task scheduler that executes a legitimate executable file that loads DESLoader
every 15 minutes.
▪It is unlikely that the same scheduled task name is created on the compromised hosts.
e.g. Improperly registered scheduled tasks observed in the past

４．Threat Actor’s Infrastructure
Threat Actor’s Infrastructure
33
1. The hostname used for the intrusion via SSL-VPN
2. Characteristics of the C2 infrastructure
Hostname used for the initial intrusion via SSL-VPN
34
▪Tendency to use distinctive hostnames and attempt intrusions 
while changing IP addresses
✔Host names used in breaches observed in the past
▪Tendency to use an IP for intrusion that is different from the C2 server’s IP

▪For C2, there is a tendency to use IP addresses and not to use domains.
▪From the observed C2 IP addresses, there is little bias toward country and AS, and we 
observed that there is a tendency not to reuse IP addresses repeatedly.
Characteristics of the C2 infrastructure
35
５．Consideration of Threat Actor’s Attribution
Considerations for attribution of A41APT
37
1. Relevance to APT10
2. Relevance to BlackTech
１．Relevance to APT10
38
*Compared to SodaMaster in 2020, only two commands are supported.
▪
Two ways linked to APT10:
▪
Confirmed the existence of an early version of 
SodaMaster (x86) in March 2019, which was involved 
in an attack against Turkey and attributed to APT10 
(mentioned [5])
▪
xRAT observed in A41APT campaign has common 
TTPs with BlackBerry Cylance reports in 2019 was 
confirmed [6].

２．Relevance to BlackTech

▪Identified common features between 
SodaMaster and 
TSCookie [7].
▪The same information is collected 
from the compromised host in the 
initial stage
– Username
– Computer name
– Current process ID
▪Observed existence of two malware, 
SodaMaster and TSCookie, on 
multiple compromised hosts

Wrap up：Features of this campaign
43
✔Targeting the kryptonite of EDR/FSA detection
•
Malware is written on the disk by the attacker's manual operation via SSL-VPN instead of malware-
originated intrusion from Spear phishing email (legitimate file, loader, encrypted file)
•
Intrusion from group affiliates, including overseas companies
•
Malware is mostly placed on servers, and the number of compromised servers are very small.
•
Most of the malware detected in the same period have different C2 addresses, so there is little tendency 
to use the same samples.
✔After the intrusion, some rough operations were seen.
•
Heavy usage of network discovery using RDP
•
Common traces deletion method of event logs
•
Recorded attacker's hostname in event log

A41APT campaign is very stealthy and difficult to detect, but it is not undetectable.
The compromised target has shifted from endpoint to server, and the intrusion route has also 
shifted from spear phishing to abusing SSL-VPN. Security measures need to be reviewed in 
your organization to respond to change in attack method.
By refining daily security operations and thoroughly reviewing the security holes in each 
organization's environment, it may be possible to detect and protect attacks from even small 
anomalies.
