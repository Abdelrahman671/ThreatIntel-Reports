WIPALL Malware Leads to #GOP Warning in
Sony
By Trend Micro ⋮
Our previous blog entry discussed the “destructive” FBI security advisory and an analysis about the
WIPALL malware family and its direct connection to the massive Sony Pictures hack. In this blog post, we
will further discuss other WIPALL malware variants and their main routines that link to the #GOP warning
seen in infected computers of Sony Pictures employees. Below is an overview of the infection chain to be
discussed in this entry:
BKDR64_WIPALL.F Disables McAfee’s Services
The WIPALL variant BKDR_WIPALL.C shares the same coding as the previously discussed variant,
BKDR_WIPALL.B. In the case of BKDR_WIPALL.C, the dropped copies are named as igfxtrays{2 random
characters}.exe and executes several copies of itself with specific parameters (-a, -m, -d, -s), which
contain its main routines.

Figure 1. Main malware routines of BKDR_WIPALL.C
It is a notable observation that BKDR_WIPALL.C checks if the infected system is 64-bit. If found to be
running on a 64-bit system, the malware drops kph.sys (KProcessHacker driver) and its component
ams.exe (detected as BKDR64_WIPALL.F).
We noticed that BKDR64_WIPALL.F replaces McAfee’s real-time scanner, mcshield.exe with another file
located in its current directory, while the original mcshield.exe is placed in the system32 directory. In turn,
when McAfee’s service executes, the replacement file will be executed instead of the legitimate real-time
scanner component, effectively disabling the antivirus’ operation.

Figure 2. BKDR64_WIPALL.F obtains the Image Path of McShield.exe from the registry’s list of services:
HKLM\CurrentControlSet\services\McShield
Figure 3. BKDR64_WIPALL.F moves the legitimate mcshield.exe to the System32 folder and replaces it
with another mcshield.exe located in the malware’s current directory
BKDR64_WIPALL.F installs KprocessHacker as a driver service and uses it to terminate the following
running processes related to McAfee’s antivirus application (also listed in the infection chain above). This
is an added measure in order to ensure the malware’s smooth execution.
mcshield.exe

UdaterUI.exe
McTray.exe
shstat.exe
FrameworkService.exe
VsTskMgr.exe
mfeann.exe
naPrdMgr.exe
Based on our analysis, the malware BKDR64_WIPALL.F may have used a driver service because it has
a higher privilege than a typical user-mode application. This is to ensure that the processes will be
terminated.

Tracing Back to #GOP
This attack, along with the one we discussed in our previous blog entry, were both found to trace back to
the hacker group named #GOP or “Guardians of Peace.”
The BKDR_WIPALL.A infection chain (via its component BKDR_WIPALL.E)  leads to an HTML file
displaying the message with the files back.jpg and index.wav. All of these are encrypted and embedded
in the component iissvr.exe (detected as BKDR_WIPALL.E).
Similarly, the infection chain for BKDR_WIPALL.D (via its component BKDR_WIPALL.C)  displays the
#GOP message in an image file dropped as walls.bmp.

There have been reports linking these attacks to North Korea as the culprit, and some claim that the
Sony hack may have been an inside job. While nothing is confirmed at the moment, we advise users to
exercise vigilance in their online to ensure private data stays that way.
