Security Brief: TA450 Uses Embedded Links in PDF
Attachments in Latest Campaign
⋮ 3/21/2024
March 21, 2024
Joshua Miller and the Proofpoint Threat Research Team 
What happened 
Proofpoint researchers recently observed new activity by the Iran-aligned threat actor TA450 (also known
as MuddyWater, Mango Sandstorm, and Static Kitten), in which the group used a pay-related social
engineering lure to target Israeli employees at large multinational organizations. TA450 is known for
targeting Israeli entities particularly since at least October 2023 with the start of the Israel-Hamas war and
this continues that trend with a focus on global manufacturing, technology, and information security
companies. 
In the phishing campaign, which started 7 March and continued through the week of 11 March 2024,
TA450 sent emails with PDF attachments that contained malicious links. While this method is not foreign
to TA450, the threat actor has more recently relied on including malicious links directly in email message
bodies instead of adding in this extra step. Proofpoint researchers observed the same targets receive
multiple phishing emails with PDF attachments that had slightly different embedded links. The links were
to a variety of file-sharing sites, including Egnyte, Onehub, Sync and TeraBox. The emails also used a
likely compromised .IL sender account, which is consistent with this threat actor’s recent activity.  
2/4
As seen in Figures 1 and 2, if a target opened the attachment and clicked on the included link, it would
lead to the download of a ZIP archive containing a compressed MSI that ultimately would install
AteraAgent, remote administration software that is known to be abused by TA450.

Attribution 
Proofpoint researchers attribute this campaign to TA450 based on known TA450 tactics, techniques, and
procedures, campaign targeting, and malware analysis. In January 2022, the United States Cyber
Command attributed this group to Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security. 
Why it matters 
3/4
This activity is notable for several reasons, including that it marks a turn in TA450’s tactics. While this
campaign is not the first observed instance of TA450 using attachments with malicious links as part of the
threat actor’s attack chain, it is the first time Proofpoint researchers have observed TA450 attempt to
deliver a malicious URL in a PDF attachment rather than directly linking the file in an email. Additionally,
this campaign is the first time Proofpoint has observed TA450 using a sender email account that matches
the lure content. For example, this campaign used an email account of salary[@]
<compromisedorg>co[.]il, which is in alignment with the various pay-themed subject lines. 
Finally, this activity continues TA450's trend of leveraging Hebrew language lures and compromised .IL
accounts to target Israeli individuals belonging to large multinational companies, maintaining a
heightened risk for organizations with this type of footprint.
