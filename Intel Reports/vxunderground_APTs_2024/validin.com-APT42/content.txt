Expanding APT42 Intelligence with Validin

Introduction
In this blog post, we’ll use indicators from a recent threat report as a starting point for further enrichment in the Validin
platform to find additional likely-related infrastructure.
On May 1, 2024, Mandiant published a threat report detailing the activities and techniques used by APT42, an Iranian
state-sponsored cyber espionage actor. The Mandiant team provided 148 domains in the Virus Total collection
included with the report. The threat report detailed websites that:
Pose as legitimate services, news outlets, and NGOs
Imitate login pages from reputable technology companies
Poste as “mailer daemons”
Pose as URL shortening services
The threat actor uses this infrastructure to assist with credential harvesting and malware deployment.
Let’s see what else we can find with Validin!
Initial Bulk Enrichment
Given the relatively large starting point, we’ll use Validin’s bulk search feature, which is available to all Professional
and Enterprise users and designed to assist with bulk analysis workflows.
We start by copying the indicators from the Virus Total collection into the indicators text box:

Copying indicators from a threat report into Validin’s bulk analysis textbox.
Note: the Mandiant team did a great job organizing these indicators by usage, and that would be a great way to work
through collections to find related behavior. However, we’ll enrich all indicators in this post at once for brevity.
Upon clicking “Next,” we notice that every indicator on the list has already been tagged as malicious by Validin. This
is because these indicators were added to the Maltrail project shortly after the report was published. Validin includes
a direct link to both the source report and the Maltrail project, which contains indicators from other published research
from APT42.
3/9
Validin provides direct links to reported threat intelligence sources whenever possible.
By clicking “Search All,” Validin performs DNS queries against all supplied indicators and then displays a side-by-side
activity timeline for every domain in the initial report. From this view, we can begin iterating and expanding awareness
of additional likely actor-controlled infrastructure.
Identifying Hosting Patterns
The first thing I notice when looking at the hosting patterns is that the activity timelines do not line up very uniformly.
Indeed, Mandiant reports that one cluster of domains has been active since 2019, another since 2021, and another
since 2022. Even within these clusters, domain activity is not tightly coordinated on the time scale.
4/9
Many domains are only active very briefly and during non-overlapping time windows.
Some of the IP addresses show up multiple times. A few are parking or cloud proxies (like Cloudflare), but others
have a fairly limited history. After time filtering, we see some patterns like the following:
5/9
IP history shows many domains used for relatively brief and non-overlapping periods.
On my first pivot, I see a domain that isn’t highlighted as known-malicious by Maltrail, like elated-supportive-
exultation[.]top pivoting through 135.181.203[.]1. That domain was registered the same day the Mandiant report was
published, so we’ve used Validin to find bleeding-edge indicators.
Continuing this process, I build a short list of IP addresses that look like they’ll provide good pivots:
78.47.209[.]46
94.131.11[.]228
135.181.203[.]1
176.9.145[.]182
192.95.36[.]226
209.133.196[.]67
217.20.117[.]39
Then I add those indicators back to the the bulk search list (under “Add Indicators”) to re-run the bulk analysis
workflow:

Adding IP indicators to the bulk search list.
This will enable two things:
1. I’ll be able to visualize the potential pivots on the timeline view quickly
2. I’ll be able to see, in the timeline view, which indicators I’ve already added as pivots
Some of the IPs are a goldmine of new indicators:
7/9
Finding unreported domains through PDNS pivots using IP hosting history.
The PDNS history for 209.133.196[.]67 shows domains with similar short-lived usage patterns, naming
conventions, and themes to other domains in the ground truth clusters.
After adding new indicators to the start of the bulk analysis workflow, I re-run the workflow to look for domains or IPs
that I can reasonably assume to be part of the same cluster of activity.
Enrichment Additions
After several iterations of this process, I’ve added 77 additional effective second-level domains (E2LDs) that I have
reasonable confidence are related based on the patterns revealed in their PDNS history. I’ve also added 39 IP
addresses that the threat actor appears to have had control over at one point or another.
Conclusion
The Validin platform facilitates threat research and validation through an easy-to-navigate UI, bulk analysis features,
and deep, precise DNS history. This combination enables researchers to quickly learn about domain and IP history,
understand activity patterns, and discover new infrastructure.
