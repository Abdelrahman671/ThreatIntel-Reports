Introduction 
At the beginning of October 2020 we found copy of a malicious document potentially 
to be attributed to an APT group known with the name of APT34 / OilRig. The 
attribution, based on several elements found within the malicious document, was 
firstly reported by a security researcher through a social network.  
The above-mentioned document, which also had a name potentially compatible with 
the interests and objectives pursued by the threat actor in question, can be uniquely 
identified by the following indicators: 
 
Type 
Value 
SHA256 
File Name 
7007f35df3292a4ecd741839fc2dafde471538041e54cfc24207d9f49016dc77 
Azerbaijan-Turky Military Negotiation.doc 
 
According  the extracted evidences, the author “signed” this malicious document 
leaving his/her username within the document metadata. This nickname was  already 
widely known within the Cyber Threat Intelligence field because attributed to a member 
of the already mentioned threat group.  
Indeed this nickname is Iamfarhadzadeh, linked to Mohammad Farhadzadeh, believed 
to be a member of the hacking unit identified by the community as APT34 / OilRig. 
Considering this threat and proceeding further with our analysis we extracted several 
evidences that highlighted a connection with a common cyber-crime adversary. In 
particular the execution of the hidden macro permitted to download a copy of a 
malicious executable identified as a variant of AgentTesla that, to the best of our 
information, has no ties to the already reported threat actor.  
These evidences headed our research team to dig further in order to understand who 
was behind this campaign and why that nickname was left within the meta-content.  
Our first hypothesis was a deliberate attempt to deceive security researchers pushing 
them to attribute the malicious campaign to a cyber-espionage operation by releasing 
a malicious document linked to a socio-politic event.

Insights 
Our investigation covered a quite extended timeframe and permitted to continuously 
monitor the attackers activities and, with a wider point of view, what is lately 
happening within the cyber-crime panorama and how these cyber criminals act.  
To better clarify, we tracked and observed the use of tools to quickly create new 
phishing campaigns aimed to steal data and information that could be sold on the dark 
market or used to directly cause an economic loss to their victims. 
In details, the analyzed document, contains a hidden macro that through the 
subroutine auto_run runs automatically the obfuscated VBA code downloading a 
malicious payload from the following URL 
Type 
Value 
URL 
https://cannabispropertybrokers.com/pop/8OwWKrFQ0gQoKt9.exe 
     
         
 
 
to be later implanted within the victim’s temp folder.  Following same evidences about 
the encoded URL as observed during the analysis the extracted payload matched 
exactly with AgentTesla payloads.   
This means that once executed the malware is able to record keystrokes, to collect user 
clipboard data, to get screenshots from the victim machine and to send all to the 
attacker command and control.

Actor Profile 
The analysis gave us also the opportunity to establish an attacker “fingerprint”, to 
deeply track it, to study all its actions and to learn about tools and methods it used to 
start and deploy a new malware campaign and operations.  
We identified infected victims but also all information related the attacker’s host. We 
got evidences that the actor was likely a member of a cyber-crime team with a low 
knowledge about packers, evasion techniques and malware in general. Furthermore, 
we observed that he repeatedly executed his own malicious payloads over his 
machines from which the campaigns are operated.  
Among all data about the threat actor, we collected several IP addresses used by 
attacker as bridges in order to pack malicious documents and spread phishing waves. 
All of these servers are reachable via RDP services.  
A quite funny part of our investigation involved also evidences about Skype and ICQ 
accounts of the crew that are currently used for sharing and exchanging compromised 
assets and emails with other cyber-criminals.  
It is interesting to note that, during the preparation phases of the campaigns, the 
threat actor seemed to act by choosing potential targets on the basis of very specific 
address lists, probably cataloged on the basis of the sector of interest.  
For example, while preparing campaigns aimed at compromising entities operating in 
Oil&Gas sector, the collected evidences suggest a web browsing activity performed by 
the adversary towards websites dedicated to news about industrial groups operating 
in this sector.  
One of these websites, which cybercriminals rely on to acquire information about the 
Oil&Gas industry, is ognnews.com, showed within the screenshot reported here below:

In other cases members of the crew search directly in darkweb websites dedicated to 
the provision of phishing kits and lists of email addresses to be included among 
potential targets. We tracked at least 8 different underground forums consulted by the 
group for purchasing compromised assets and get tools to obfuscate malware. In 
particular, threat actor seems to prefer buy and use a malware core which can be 
referred to as OriginLogger. OriginLogger in conjunction with the use of an online PE 
crypter, called Cassandra, generates malicious payloads internally matching 
AgentTesla's signatures.

Furthermore, in order to have a clearer view about the spread of the threat, an ad-hoc 
signature has been internally created for the malware family in question, starting from 
the sample identified by the following hash: 
Type 
Value 
sha256 
cda07296d20a239bdb9cb5a2c9a814f69811bc85ced8bf32e998b906a413f416 
 
This signature made it possible to obtain a good level of detection with a low false 
positive rate. As the image below reports, starting from the second week of October 
2020, the group began to heavily spread “OriginLogger plus Cassandra” payloads, 
internally reaching a number of unique detections exceeding the 500 hits from mid-
October until dropping around only 10 to December 1, 2020 (this is probably as a 
consequence of the increase in the global detection rates of the variants in question).

Threat actor targeted many entities and organizations across different industrialized 
countries, including Italy. The operations involved as well many individual users.  
We counted around at least 300 Italian email addresses as targets of phishing 
campaigns operated by this adversary from mid-October 2020. Among the most 
impacted sectors we observed industry, manufacturing, transports, energy and 
oil&gas.  
According to the collected evidences below are reported details about to the countries 
where victims of these phishing campaigns are located:

Our internal Threat Intelligence Research Team links the threat actor in question with 
a criminally-motivated organization operating from Nigeria. The techniques, tactics 
and procedures observed overlaps with a threat actor described in a research paper by 
NTT, dated October 2020, available at URL  
https://hello.global.ntt/-/media/ntt/global/insights/gtic-monthly-threat-report/gtic-
monthly-threat-report-october-2020.pdf 
In this paper, NTT researchers described malicious campaigns and BEC operations 
perpetrated by an actor operating from Nigeria, they named OZIE Team. As many of 
the characteristics of the adversary we tracked overlap with what is reported in the 
aforementioned document, we assert, with a medium degree of confidence, that the 
threat actor in question is part of or is potentially close to the OZIE gang.
