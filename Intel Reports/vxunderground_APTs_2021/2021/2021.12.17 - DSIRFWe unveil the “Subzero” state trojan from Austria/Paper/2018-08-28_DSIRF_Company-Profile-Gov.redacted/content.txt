Evidence is becoming primarily digital.
Technical obstacles make it increasingly difficult for governments 
and law enforcement agencies to de-anonymise and access data
from suspects.
The Rationale
Encrypted channels allow criminals to exchange information
and hide from law enforcement surveillance.

Predictive Policing
100 hours of accessible CCTV 
footage can be analysed for faces of
criminals in just 10 hours by our 
algorithms
images of terrorists or of any person
of interest can be checked against
social networks, blogs and other 
digital sources and databases
learning from criminal activities in the
past, our algorithms derive risky areas 
and predict strategies of outlaws to
make police work more effective
