APT31 intrusion set campaign
Summary
In January 2021, ANSSI was informed of a large campaign of attacks against French entities linked to the APT31
intrusion set.
The investigations carried out by ANSSI led to the analysis of the intrusion set’s entire chaine of infection. In turn,
the knowledge acquired was used to monitor malicious activity and proactively identify already infected victims.
One characteristic of this intrusion set lies in its use of an anonymisation infrastructure consisting of a set of com-
promised routers organised as a mesh network. This network is orchestrated using a malware named Pakdoor by
ANSSI.
It has not been possible to identify any targeting criteria used by the intrusion set, whether sectoral or thematic.
A reasonable hypothesis is that the use of this intrusion set follows an opportunistic approach to breach the infor-
mation systems of French entities and then proceeds to exploiting this initial access to reach its goals.
Following the publication of indicators of compromise on the CERT-FR’s website on July 21st 2021 1, this report
lays out the technical information related to this campaign of attacks: chain of infection (section 1), analysis of the
attack infrastructure (section 2) as well as the observed victimology (section 3).

1.10. Exfiltration
During its campaign, the intrusion set was able to exfiltrate user databases, emails and sensitive business data.
1.10.1. Creation of email accounts
In order to exfiltrate data from a MICROSOFT Exchange server, the intrusion set might use the impersonation func-
tion (or ApplicationImpersonation role). This allows a service account to be granted access to several mailboxes. To
do this, the APT31 intrusion set creates accounts named « HealthMailbox<*> » (where * represents seven alphanu-
merical characters) on MICROSOFT Exchange servers.
These accounts then attempt to masquerade as legitimate HealthMailbox accounts which take the following format:
« HealthMailbox<GUID> ».
1.10.2. Domain Name System (DNS)
The intrusion set uses COBALT STRIKE to exfiltrate the data collected through the DNS protocol.
1.10.3. Server Message Block (SMB)
The intrusion set uses the SMB remote file sharing protocol to exfiltrate large amounts of data.

2. Anonymisation infrastructure
2.1. Targeted equipment
The infrastructure used during this campaign consists of a network of compromised machines, more specifically of
Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) routers. These are mainly PAKEDGE, SOPHOS and CISCO branded routers.
About a thousand IP addresses used by the attacker during this campaign have been discovered 7. 623 of these
addresses have been linked to one brand and one particular model of routers. This could be determined through
the analysis of the exposed services. However, this analysis alone is not sufficient in itself to formally precisely
determine which devices were used. Several devices can indeed exist behind a single IP address. A statistical analysis
of this subset of IP addresses does, however, reveal an over-representation of certain brands of router.
2.1.1. Pakedge
PAKEDGE routers represent 64% of the compromised routers identified. Among these routers, the folowing models
were identified:
• Pakedge RE-1
• Pakedge RE-2
• Pakedge RK-1
• Pakedge RK-2
2.1.2. Other routers
Although PAKEDGE routers make up a significant proportion of the routers identified, the following brands were
also observed:
• SOPHOS CYBEROAM;
• CISCO (models RV042 and RV042G).
The method used by APT31 to breach these devices has not been identified. The hypotheses are as follows :
• The different brands of routers share a firmware which may present vulnerabilities. For example, the vul-
nerability affecting Realtek Managed Switch Controller could be found in several models of router by different
brands, including PAKEDGE and CISCO 8.
• Different vulnerabilities were exploited on each type of router.
7. For confidentiality reason, these IP cannot be shared.

2.2. Pakdoor
In order to manage the infected routers and allow them to communicate with each other, a sophisticated back-
door, named Pakdoor by ANSSI, was installed on every machine. Its analysis can be found in the report « APT31:
Pakdoor ».
2.3. Representation of the anonymisation infrastructure
Using elements provided by ANSSI partners, together with the Pakdoor code analysis, it is possible to depict the
anonymisation infrastructure as follows:

APT31 intrusion set campaign
2.4. Use of the anonymisation infrastructure
The threat actor’s command and control infrastructure (C2) is based on the anonymisation infrastructure. Indeed,
some Cobalt Strike Beacon C2 domains were linked to breached routers 9.
APT31 also uses this infrastructure to conduct scans and web browsing. It would appear that the threat actor uses
this infrastrcuture as its main anonymisation layer of all of its communications.
3. Victimology
An analysis of the different targets of this campaign reveals that victims were targeted broadly. It is therefore likely
that for this campaign, the APT31 intrusion set was opportunistic in its approach to selecting targets.
