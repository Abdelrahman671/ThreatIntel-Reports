This summary provides an overview of reports on APT and financial attacks 
on industrial enterprises that were disclosed in H2 2023, as well as the related 
activities of groups that have been observed attacking industrial organizations 
and critical infrastructure facilities. For each topic, we have sought to summarize 
the key facts, findings, and conclusions of researchers that we believe may be 
of use to professionals addressing the practical issues of cybersecurity 
for industrial enterprises.  
Among many APT-related stories, three stand out. Two of them involve attack 
vectors that resulted in gaining access to the automated control system 
and these attacks led to a physical effect – an attack on a Ukrainian energy 
company and attacks on an Israeli-made Unitronics PLC. 
The third story – an attack on industrial companies using MATA tools – is 
interesting due to the high complexity of the tools used by the attackers, 
a fascinating story about the lateral movement of attackers within the network 
of a compromised organization, and the intrigue that arose when attributing 
the tools to the known APT groups. 
Korean-speaking activity 
Lazarus attacks  
Сampaign targeted the defense industry and nuclear engineers 
Kaspersky researchers discovered a Lazarus campaign beginning in 2023 
that targeted the defense industry and nuclear engineers.  
They use Trojanized apps, especially backdoored VNC apps, to access 
enterprise systems. In this campaign, Lazarus tricks job seekers on social media 
into opening malicious apps for fake job interviews. To avoid detection 
by behavior-based security solutions, this backdoored application operates 
discreetly, activating only when the user selects a server from the Trojanized 
VNC client's drop-down menu. Upon opening this initial infection vector, 
the application proceeds to launch additional payloads into memory and retrieve 
further malicious code.  
Kaspersky researchers observed an additional payload known as LPEClient, 
which has been previously employed multiple times by the Lazarus group. 
Furthermore, it employs sophisticated C2 communication methods and disables 
application behavior monitoring of security solutions by unhooking user-mode 
syscalls. The use of an updated version of COPPERHEDGE as an additional 
backdoor was identified, exhibiting a complex infection chain. In addition,

the presence of a malware variant specifically designed to transfer targeted 
files to a remote server was observed. This particular malware serves 
the purpose of exfiltrating specific files chosen by the Lazarus group 
and sending them to their designated remote server.  
Our telemetry confirms numerous instances of compromised companies. 
The majority of affected entities are directly involved in defense manufacturing, 
encompassing radar systems, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), military vehicles, 
vessels, weaponry, and companies related to the navy. Furthermore, in one 
of the cases, the username associated with the initial infection vector was 
identified. Through conversations with the victim, Kaspersky researchers found 
out that this individual was a nuclear engineer based in Hungary who received 
the malicious file after getting into contact with a suspicious account 
via Telegram and WhatsApp.  
Attacks with LightlessCan backdoor  
Researchers at ESET detected a malware campaign involving a previously 
unknown backdoor named LightlessCan. The Lazarus Group managed 
to compromise an aerospace company in Spain. The initial vector of attack was 
a spear phishing email in which the hackers pretended to be recruiters 
from Meta and sent messages to developers via LinkedIn Messaging. 
LightlessCan backdoor Windows functions include the ability to mimic 
the functionality of many native Windows commands like ping, ipconfig, 
systeminfo, sc, net, and more. ESET speculated that in developing LightlessCan, 
Lazarus may have reverse-engineered closed-source system binaries to add 
additional functionality to the RAT. The threat actor also rigged LightlessCan 
in such a manner that its encrypted payload can only be decrypted using 
a decryption key specific to the compromised machine. The goal is to ensure that 
the payload decryption is only possible on target systems and not in any other 
environment, Kálnai noted, such as a system belonging to a security researcher. 
Operation Blacksmith 
A new Lazarus group campaign dubbed “Operation Blacksmith” by Cisco Talos 
researchers has been using at least three new DLang-based malware strains 
in attacks on organizations worldwide from manufacturing, agriculture, 
and physical security sectors since as early as March 2023. This campaign 
consists of continued opportunistic targeting of enterprises globally 
that publicly host and expose their vulnerable infrastructure to n-day 
vulnerability exploitation, such as CVE-2021-44228 (Log4j). Two of the malware 
variants are RATs, one of which, NineRAT” uses Telegram bots and channels

for C2 communications. The non-Telegram-based RAT is tracked by researchers 
as DLRAT, and the DLang-based downloader is tracked as BottomLoader. 
Researchers observed an overlap between the TTPs used in this campaign 
and those of Onyx Sleet (aka PLUTONIUM and Andariel).  
Attack on a Russian missile engineering company 
SentinelLabs researchers reported that two APT threat actors gained 
persistent access to the internal systems of a Russian missile and satellite 
developer. ScarCruft was responsible for the compromise of the company’s 
email systems, while Lazarus compromised the network using a Windows 
backdoor called OpenCarrot. The analyzed OpenCarrot variant implements over 
25 backdoor commands with a wide range of functionality representative 
of Lazarus group backdoors. According to research, these findings establish 
connections between two distinct DPRK-affiliated threat actors, suggesting 
the potential for shared resources, infrastructure, implants, or access 
to victim networks. 
Andariel attacks 
AhnLab Security Emergency Response Center (ASEC) researchers analyzed 
recent attacks carried out by Andariel against universities, ICT, electronic 
equipment, shipbuilding, and manufacturing companies in South Korea. 
A characteristic of the attacks is the use of new malware developed 
in the Go language, including Goat RAT and DurianBeacon. The latter 
also features a version developed in the Rust language. One of the attacks 
detected by ASEC in February 2023 is said to have involved the exploitation 
of security flaws in an enterprise file transfer solution called Innorix Agent 
to distribute backdoors such as Volgmer and Andardoor, as well as 
a Golang-based reverse shell known as 1th Troy. 
A major cyber espionage campaign in which Andariel APT group hacked a wide 
range of companies and stole sensitive defense information in South Korea was 
reported. The investigation is being led by the Seoul Police Department 
with the involvement of the U.S. FBI. Officials believe that the hackers managed 
to steal information about laser weapons used to support the operation 
of the national air defense system. The agencies believe the intrusions were part 
of a larger cyber campaign that resulted in a total data breach of more 
than 1.2 TB, including corporate, government and personal data.  
Andariel was able to successfully hack 14 organizations, also participating 
in attacks using ransomware, which were carried out from a loosely monitored 
South Korean proxy server used by hackers 83 times from December 2022

to March 2023 from Pyongyang's Ryugyong-dong district. The server was used 
to access the websites of firms and institutions, with the group taking 
advantage of a South Korean hosting service that rents servers to unidentified 
clients. Among those compromised were large companies in the field 
of communications, information security and IT, technology centers, universities 
and research institutes engaged in advanced developments and technologies, 
pharmaceutical companies, defense enterprises, and financial organizations. 
Attacks on defense contractors with the use 
of updated MATA framework 
Kaspersky experts discovered a new, active campaign of the MATA cluster 
malware compromising defense contractors in Eastern Europe. The campaign 
spanned over six months and remained active until May 2023 and featured three 
new generations of the MATA.  
One of them is an evolution of previous MATA generation 2. Second, 
the malware we dubbed “MataDoor”, has been rewritten from scratch 
and may be considered as generation 4, and then generation 5 has been 
rewritten from scratch as well. All of them introduce several modifications 
to its encryption, configuration, and communication protocols.  
The actor demonstrated high capabilities of navigating through and leveraging 
security solutions deployed in the victim’s environment. In situations where 
no communication line to a desired target host was possible, the actor used 
a USB propagation module capable of bridging the air-gapped networks. 
Attackers used many techniques to hide their activity: rootkits and vulnerable 
drivers, disguising files as legitimate applications, using ports open 
for communication between applications, multi-level encryption of files 
and network activity of malware, setting long wait times between connections 
to control servers – this and much more shows how sophisticated modern 
targeted attacks can be.   
From the very first versions of MATA the experts have had some doubt as which 
APT it belongs to. This doubt grew with the latest MATA generations. On one 
side, there are obvious arguments that tie the MATA family to the Lazarus 
group. At the same time, the latest MATA generations have more techniques 
similar to ones used by Five Eyes APT groups.

Middle East-related activity 
Dark Caracal attacks 
While tracking Dark Caracal's activity, Kaspersky researchers discovered 
an ongoing campaign targeting public and private sector entities in multiple 
Spanish-speaking countries. Dark Caracal is known to have been conducting 
cyber-espionage campaigns since at least 2012. The group’s campaigns target 
governments, military entities, utilities, financial institutions, manufacturing 
companies, and defense contractors worldwide. Thousands of victims suffered 
from Dark Caracal – valuable data is found to have been stolen, including 
intellectual property and personally identifiable information. This group has been 
referenced as a “cyber mercenary threat group” due to the variety of targets 
and apparent targeting of multiple governments throughout its campaigns. 
Since 2021, the activity of this group has been reported focusing 
on Spanish-speaking countries. 
Ballistic Bobcat/Charming Kitten attacks 
ESET researchers uncovered a sophisticated cyber-espionage campaign carried 
out by suspected Iranian-aligned threat actor Ballistic Bobcat (aka APT35, 
APT42, Charming Kitten, TA453, and PHOSPHORUS). The group used a new 
backdoor named Sponsor to target organizations in Brazil, Israel, and the UAE: 
the targeted entities include automotive, manufacturing, engineering, financial 
services, media, healthcare, technology, and telecoms sectors. The Sponsor 
backdoor is written in C++ and designed to collect information about the host 
and process commands received from a remote server, the results of which 
are sent back to the server. 
According to the report, the latest campaign, codenamed Sponsoring Access, 
involves gaining initial access by exploiting known vulnerabilities in Microsoft 
Exchange servers. In one of the incidents described by ESET, an Israeli company 
was compromised by an attacker in August 2021, and the delivery of tools 
for the next stage (PowerLess, Plink, and a number of open source 
post-exploitation tools written in Go) was implemented over several months. 
As experts concluded, Ballistic Bobcat continues to find opportunities to exploit 
unpatched vulnerabilities on Microsoft Exchange servers accessible 
from the network using a new and diverse arsenal of tools.

Imperial Kitten/Yellow Liderc/Tortoiseshell attacks 
According to PwC researchers, threat actor Yellow Liderc (aka Imperial Kitten, 
Tortoiseshell, TA456, and Crimson Sandstorm) has launched watering-hole 
attacks to distribute IMAPLoader malware, which exploits Windows utilities 
to identify target systems and deploy additional payloads. The targets 
of the campaign include maritime, shipping and logistics organizations across 
the Mediterranean; nuclear, aerospace, and defense industries in the U.S. 
and Europe, and IT-managed service providers in the Middle East. While new 
attacks involved compromising legitimate websites with malicious JavaScript 
designed to exfiltrate data, the threat actor has also used a fraudulent 
Microsoft Excel document as an initial attack vector. 
After the PwC report, CrowdStrike reported that the same actor referred 
to as Imperial Kitten has been targeting transportation, logistics, and technology 
sectors in the Middle East, including Israel, since the onset of the Israel-Hamas 
conflict. The group’s activity is characterized by the use of social engineering, 
particularly job recruitment-themed content, to deliver custom .NET-based 
implants. The attackers use compromised websites to profile visitors using 
bespoke JavaScript and exfiltrate the information. In addition to the use 
of watering holes, the threat actor also uses one-day exploits, stolen credentials, 
and phishing, and targets upstream IT service providers for initial access. 
OilRig attacks 
ESET researchers analyzed a series of new OilRig (aka APT34, Lyceum, Crambus, 
or Siamesekitten) downloaders that the threat actor used in 2022 campaigns 
to target organizations in Israel, including a healthcare organization, 
a manufacturing company, and a local governmental body. All targets were 
previously affected by multiple OilRig campaigns. The new downloaders named 
SampleCheck5000 (SC5k v1-v3), OilCheck, ODAgent, and OilBooster, 
are notable for using legitimate cloud storage and cloud-based email services 
for C2 communications and data exfiltration as a way to hide malicious 
communication and mask the group’s network infrastructure: 
Microsoft OneDrive, Exchange Online and Office 365 through via Microsoft 
Graph and Outlook API, as well as Microsoft Office Exchange Web Services 
(EWS). These downloaders share similarities with MrPerfectionManager 
and PowerExchange backdoors, other recent additions to OilRig’s toolset 
that use email-based C&C protocols.

Peach Sandstorm/APT33 attacks 
According to Microsoft, the threat actor Peach Sandstorm (aka APT33, Elfin, 
and Refined Kitten) targeted organizations in the defense industrial base sector 
using a new backdoor called FalseFont. This is a custom backdoor that allows 
attackers to remotely access infected systems, launch additional files, and send 
information to its C2. This malware strain was first observed in the wild around 
early November 2023. The development and use of FalseFont is consistent 
with Peach Sandstorm activity observed by Microsoft over the past year, 
suggesting that Peach Sandstorm is continuing to improve their tradecraft.  
Chinese-speaking activity 
TEMP.Hex and UNC4698 USB attacks 
Researchers at Mandiant reported a threefold increase in attacks involving 
USB drives in the first half of this year. In one such campaign, threat actor 
TEMP.Hex (aka HoneyMyte) used USB drives to distribute the Sogu malware, 
designed to steal sensitive information from host systems. They believe 
that TEMP.Hex is using Sogu to collect information of economic and national 
security interest to China. TEMP.Hex is targeting a variety of sectors, 
including construction and engineering, business services, government, health, 
transportation, and retail organizations in Europe, Asia, and the U.S. 
Another threat actor tracked as UNC4698 is also using USB drives to spread 
the SnowyDrive malware, which creates a backdoor on infected systems, 
providing attackers a way to remotely interact with the device and issue 
commands. The backdoor supports many commands that perform 
file operations, data exfiltration, reverse shelling, command execution, 
and reconnaissance. It also spreads to other USB drives and over the network. 
The malware uses DLL search order hijacking to load a malicious DLL 
via legitimate executables such as Notepad++, Microsoft Silverlight, 
VentaFax Software, and CAM UnZip Software. UNC4698 is targeting oil 
and gas organizations in Asia. 
Space Pirates attacks 
Positive Technologies released a report on new large-scale attacks on 
organizations in Russia and Serbia carried out by the Chinese-speaking Space 
Pirates group tracked by researchers since 2022. The main goal of the group 
is espionage and data theft. The group has expanded the areas of interest. 
Over the past year, at least 16 organizations in Russia and one (a ministry)

in Serbia have become victims, including state and educational institutions, 
enterprises of the aviation, rocket-space, and agricultural industries, the 
military-industrial and fuel-energy complex, and infosec companies. 
An Acunetix scanner was found on one of the control servers. This indicates 
a likely attack vector through the exploitation of vulnerabilities, which has not 
been observed before. The group also targeted PST mail archives.  
The Godzilla web shell and obfuscated Neo-reGeorg tunnel were found 
on the C2 server. The group also began to use ShadowPad malware. In almost 
every investigation, there were traces of Deed RAT being used, which is still 
under development. When investigating the incident, a 64-bit version of this 
malware was found on one of the infected devices, which is almost the same 
as the 32-bit version. Two new plugins were found on computers infected 
with Deed RAT. The first one is called Disk and is used to work with disks. 
The second plugin is called Portmap, which was based on the ZXPortMap utility. 
The plugin is used for port forwarding and supports three network commands. 
During one of the investigations, a previously unknown sample of malware 
was found which was delivered through the already installed Deed RAT 
and subsequently named Voidoor. The life cycle of this malware included 
interaction through GitHub and the voidtools forum. The latter together 
with the analysis of GitHub repositories led researchers to the hacker's blog 
on the Chinese Software Developer Network. Positive Technologies researchers 
assume with a certain degree of confidence that the author is one 
of the malware developers (if not the only one). 
APT31 attacks 
Kaspersky ICS CERT identified over 15 implants and their variants planted 
by the APT31 (aka Judgment Panda and Zirconium) threat actor in a series 
of attacks against industrial organizations in Eastern Europe designed to steal 
sensitive data. The malware is typically installed using DLL hijacking and covers 
its tracks by using the RC4 algorithm to encrypt data until just prior to being 
injected. The malware includes a worm component able to infect removable 
drives and steal sensitive data, including data on an air-gapped device. 
Other implants include Variants of FourteenHi backdoor, MeatBall backdoor, 
Implant using Yandex Cloud as C2, and implants used to upload files to Dropbox.

UNC4841 attacks 
Following up on earlier research into the exploitation of a remote command 
injection vulnerability affecting the Barracuda Email Security Gateway (ESG) 
appliance (CVE-2023-2868) by UNC4841, Mandiant researchers provided further 
detail on TTPs used by the threat actor.  
UNC4841 deployed new malware designed to maintain presence at a small 
subset of high priority targets compromised either before the patch 
was released or shortly afterwards. This includes use of the SKIPJACK 
and DEPTHCHARGE backdoors and the FOXTROT/FOXGLOVE launcher.  
The threat actor targeted a wide variety of verticals: primary targets include 
national governments, high-tech and IT entities, local governments, telecoms 
providers, manufacturing entities, and colleges and universities. 
The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) provided 
additional IoCs associated with the exploitation of this vulnerability. 
Flax Typhoon attacks 
Microsoft researchers report that a newly discovered Chinese-speaking threat 
actor dubbed Flax Typhoon targeted dozens of organizations in Taiwan. Flax 
Typhoon has been active since mid-2021 and has targeted government agencies 
and education, critical manufacturing, and information technology organizations 
in Taiwan. The purpose of the attacks is cyber-espionage. 
The group seeks to maintain access to organizations across a broad range 
of industries for as long as possible. Flax Typhoon uses minimal malware, primarily 
relying on “living-off-the-land” techniques. The attackers obtained initial access 
by exploiting known vulnerabilities in public-facing servers (in VPN, web, Java, 
and SQL applications) and deploying web shells, including China Chopper.  
The threat actor is thought by some researchers to have been operating since 
mid-2021. However, Taiwanese threat intelligence group TeamT5 has disputed 
this, dating the group’s activities back to at least 2020 and giving it 
the temporary code name SLIME13. 
Volt Typhoon attacks 
The Black Lotus Labs team at Lumen Technologies linked the threat actor 
Volt Typhoon (aka BRONZE SILHOUETTE) to a botnet called KV-botnet used 
to target routers, firewalls, and VPN devices to camouflage malicious traffic 
within legitimate traffic. The targeted devices include Netgear ProSAFE 
firewalls, Cisco RV320s, DrayTek Vigor routers, and Axis IP cameras.  
  
  
 
 
 
APT AND FINANCIAL ATTACKS ON INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATIONS  
IN H2 2023

© 2024 AO KASPERSKY LAB 
 
The KV-botnet has been used in attacks targeting telecoms and ISPs, 
a U.S. territorial government entity in Guam, a renewable energy firm in Europe, 
and U.S. military organizations, though researchers classify the majority 
of the KV infections as opportunistic.  
Beginning in August 2023, researchers observed an uptick in the exploitation 
of new bots for KV-botnet. This cluster infected SOHO devices associated 
with a handful of high value networks. While no prebuilt functions in the original 
binary to enable targeting of the adjacent LAN were discovered, there was 
the ability to spawn a remote shell on the SOHO device. This capability could 
have been used to either manually run commands or potentially retrieve 
a yet-to-be discovered secondary module to target the adjacent LAN. 
Redfly attacks 
A new threat actor was discovered by Symantec dubbed Redfly that infiltrated 
the national power grid of an Asian country using the ShadowPad Trojan. 
The report states that the attackers managed to steal credentials 
and compromise several computers on the organization's network, 
and that this attack is the latest in a series of espionage intrusions against 
the country's critical national infrastructure.  
The ShadowPad variant disguises itself as VMware files and directories 
on infected machines and establishes persistence by registering a service 
that starts when Windows starts. In addition to ShadowPad, Redfly was seen 
deploying PackerLoader, a tool for downloading and executing shellcode, 
and a keylogger, which was installed under different names on different 
machines. The group acted quite methodically and consistently changed 
permissions for the driver, which was later used to create file system dumps 
and download credentials from the Windows registry. Hackers used a tool 
to dump credentials from LSASS, and a scheduled task was used to execute 
Oleview for side-loading and lateral movement. To install a keylogger 
on a compromised machine, the attackers tried to dump credentials 
using ProcDump.  
According to Symantec, the most obvious motive of the group is espionage. 
Identified tools and infrastructure used in the recent campaign targeting 
the national power grid overlaps with previously reported attacks attributed 
to a cluster of APT41 activity (aka Brass Typhoon, Wicked Panda, Winnti, 
and Red Echo).

Attacks on semiconductor companies in East Asia 
Semiconductor companies in East Asia (Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore) 
have been targeted using messages purporting to come from the Taiwan 
Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC).  
The attacks used the HyperBro backdoor, which leveraged a digitally signed 
CyberArk binary (fv_host.exe, renamed by malicious actors to vfhost.exe) 
for DLL side-loading, resulting in the in-memory execution of a Cobalt Strike 
beacon. The C2 address hardcoded into the Cobalt Strike implant was disguised 
as a legitimate jQuery CDN, allowing it to bypass firewall protection.  
In the second attack variant, hackers used a compromised Cobra DocGuard 
web server to download an additional McAfee binary (mcods.exe) and a malicious 
file (which is loaded in the mcods.exe using DLL side-loading), and an encrypted 
Cobalt Strike shellcode. In this case, the hackers deployed a previously 
undocumented Go-based backdoor called ChargeWeapon designed to collect 
and transmit victim’s data to the C2 in Base64 encoded form. 
EclecticIQ researchers have attributed the campaign to a China-linked threat 
actor due to its use of HyperBro, which has been almost exclusively used 
by Lucky Mouse (aka APT27, Budworm, and Emissary Panda). They also found 
tactical overlaps with RedHotel and Earth Lusca. 
Russian-speaking activity 
Attacks with DroxiDat/SystemBC 
An unknown actor targeted an electric utility in Africa with Cobalt Strike 
beacons and DroxiDat, a newer variant of the SystemBC payload. This attack 
occurred in the third and fourth week of March 2023 as part of a small wave 
of attacks across the world. In one of several related incidents, Nokoyawa 
ransomware was detected, which is linked with zero-day exploitation 
and a potential link to a group that deployed the Hive ransomware. To date, 
the group behind Nokoyawa ransomware activity has not seen publicly available 
precise political attribution, but appears to be used by an older Russian-speaking 
crimeware group/ransomware affiliate (probably Pistachio Tempest or FIN12). 
APT29/Midnight Blizzard/Nobelium attacks 
Microsoft researchers report that Midnight Blizzard (aka Nobelium) has been 
using Microsoft Teams chats to target individuals in government, NGOs, 
IT services, technology, discrete manufacturing, and media sectors.  Overall,

the current investigation indicates this campaign has affected fewer 
than 40 unique global organizations.  
The attackers used compromised Microsoft 365 accounts to create domains 
that masquerade as organizations offering tech support. They then use these 
domains to send chat messages with links to web pages where they try to phish 
recipient’s credentials, specifically MFA code. 
The FortiGuard Incident Response team reported that in October 2023, 
a U.S.-based biomedical manufacturing organization was compromised 
due to a critical CVE-2023-42793 TeamCity vulnerability that the publicly 
accessible exploit had been released for on September 27, 2023. TeamCity 
is a product by JetBrains used to manage and automate software compilation, 
building, testing, and release.  
The attack was initially exploited using a custom-built exploit script written 
in Python. The threat actor used the TeamCity exploit to install 
an SSH certificate, which they used to maintain access to the victim’s 
environment. After executing the discovery commands, the actor downloaded 
a DLL file, AclNumsInvertHost.dll, on the TeamCity host and again used 
the TeamCity RCE vulnerability to create a Windows-scheduled task 
referencing the DLL file for persistence.  
The AclNumsInvertHost.dll library and multiple other DLL files pulled 
from the threat actors' webserver matched on a Yara rule for a known 
malware family called GraphicalProton that was historically linked to APT29 
(aka the Dukes, CozyBear, and NOBELIUM/Midnight Blizzard/BlueBravo). 
Given the technique crossover with previously reported activity 
and the identification of the GraphicalProton payload, FortiGuard believes 
with medium confidence that this attack was part of a new 
BlueBravo/APT29 campaign. 
In a joint advisory published on December 13, the FBI, the Cybersecurity 
& Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the NSA, the Polish Military 
Counterintelligence Service (SKW), CERT Polska (CERT.PL), and the UK National 
Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) warned that APT29 has been exploiting 
an authentication bypass vulnerability (CVE-2023-42793) in TeamCity. 
The agencies have alerted dozens of companies in the U.S., Europe, Asia, 
and Australia after discovering hundreds of compromised devices.

Attacks exploiting WinRAR vulnerability 
The vulnerability CVE-2023-38831 in WinRAR, a Windows file archiving utility, 
is the high-severity bug which has been exploited since early 2023. 
RARLabs released WinRAR 6.23 in August to address the vulnerability. 
Sandworm attacks 
Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) observed multiple government-backed 
hacking groups exploiting the vulnerability CVE-2023-38831. In April 2023, 
TAG reported on FROZENBARENTS (aka SANDWORM) targeting the energy 
sector and continuing hack-and-leak operations. In an early-September attack, 
Sandworm hackers delivered Rhadamanthys infostealer malware in phishing 
attacks using fake invitations to join a Ukrainian drone training school. 
Rhadamanthys is a commodity infostealer that collects and exfiltrates browser 
credentials and session information among other things. It operates 
on a subscription-based model and can be rented out for as low as 
$250 for 30 days.  
APT28 attacks 
The APT28 group (aka Frozenlake, Fancy Bear, Strontium, or Sednit) also used 
the flaw to deliver malware targeting energy infrastructure in Ukraine 
via a phishing campaign that used a decoy document inviting targets to an event 
hosted by Razumkov Center, a public policy think tank in Ukraine.  
Proofpoint also reported the use of the vulnerability CVE-2023-38831 
by TA422 (aka APT28). According to Proofpoint researchers, TA422 used 
the vulnerabilities as initial access against government, aerospace, education, 
finance, manufacturing, and technology sector targets likely to either disclose 
user credentials or initiate follow-on activity.  
In September 2023, the actor sent malicious emails spoofing geopolitical entities 
and using the BRICS Summit and a European Parliament meeting as subject lures 
to entice targets to open the emails. The researchers also observed 
that between September 2023 and November 2023, the attackers sent lures 
to targets which included a link that, if clicked, initiated a chain of malicious 
activity from Mockbin service.  
In November 2023, TA422 abandoned the use of Mockbin for initial filtering 
and redirection in favor of direct delivery of InfinityFree URLs.

Mysterious Werewolf  
Researchers from Cyble Research and Intelligence Labs (CRIL) uncovered 
a targeted spear phishing attack on a Russian semiconductor supplier. 
The phishing email was disguised as an official communication from the Ministry 
of Industry and Trade of Russia, the email contained a deceptive archive file 
named resultati_sovehchaniya_11_09_2023.rar. 
The threat actors behind this attack also used this vulnerability. 
The malicious .NET payload, the Athena agent of the Mythic C2 framework, 
is equipped with an extensive tool of pre-installed commands tailored 
to perform various actions on the targeted systems. Athena comes loaded 
with features, such as Crossplatform for Windows, Linux, and OSX, SOCKS5 
Support, Reverse Port Forwarding, Reflective loading of Assemblies, Modular 
loading of commands, and much more. In this case, it was configured to use 
Discord as the C2 communication channel.  
The BI.ZONE Cyber Threat Intelligence team also tracked this activity cluster 
dubbed Mysterious Werewolf and uncovered another attack in the campaign, 
this time targeting industry facilities in Russia. Attackers posed as the Russian 
Ministry of Industry and Trade and used phishing emails that contained archives 
named Pismo_izveshcanie_2023_10_16.rar with malicious CMD files that 
exploited the CVE-2023-38831 vulnerability to launch a PowerShell script 
and ultimately download an Athena agent. The attackers used a dynamic DNS 
service and post-exploitation frameworks, as well as a scheduled task to run 
the agent every 10 minutes. 
Other APT28/Fancy Bear attacks 
CERT-UA reported a targeted cyberattack against a critical energy 
infrastructure facility in Ukraine. The attackers sent emails designed to lure 
targets into downloading a seemingly innocent archive file. This archive 
contained malicious scripts that hijacked the computer and exfiltrated sensitive 
data using services such as mockbin.org and mocky.io.  
Zscaler researchers analyzed the key components of this attack and another 
campaign dubbed StealIt with similar TTPs that align with the APT28 (Fancy 
Bear) threat actor. According to researchers, the attackers stole and exfiltrated 
NTLMv2 hashes using customized versions of Nishang's Start-CaptureServer 
PowerShell script and executed various system commands. Threat actors 
focused on targeting regions including Australia, Poland, and Belgium 
in this campaign.

Since March, Microsoft researchers have observed phishing attacks by TA422 
(aka APT28, Forest Blizzard, Strontium, Fancy Bear, and Fighting Ursa) targeting 
government, energy, transportation, and non-governmental organizations 
in the U.S., Europe, and the Middle East.  
The threat actor is exploiting two vulnerabilities. The first (CVE-2023-23397) 
is a Microsoft Outlook elevation of privilege vulnerability. The vulnerability 
doesn’t require any user interaction. Palo Alto researchers have observed 
the threat actor exploiting this vulnerability over the past 20 months to target 
at least 30 organizations in 14 countries including in the energy, transportation, 
and telecommunications sectors, and the military industrial base. The campaigns 
all used Ubiquiti networking devices to harvest NTLM authentication messages 
from victim networks. Microsoft initially patched the Outlook vulnerability 
in March, warning that it was being actively exploited, and has since updated 
its guidance for customers.  
The use of the second vulnerability – CVE-2023-38831 – was reported 
by Proofpoint (see above).  
Other Sandworm/Hades attacks 
According to Mandiant researchers, Sandworm (aka Hades) carried out 
a cyberattack on a Ukrainian electric utility that began in June 2022 
and culminated in October 2022, causing a power blackout. The initial access 
vector into the IT environment wasn’t identified.  
At first, the attackers deployed the Neo-REGEORG webshell on a server 
exposed on the public internet. After one month, the hackers executed 
the Golang-based GOGETTER tunneler to proxy encrypted communications 
for the command and control server using the Yamux open-source library.  
Sandworm gained access to the OT environment through a hypervisor 
that hosted a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) management 
instance for the victim’s substation environment and maintained access 
for up to 3 months.  
The attack culminated in activity that had a physical effect. 
First, Sandworm used an ISO CD-ROM image file to run the native ABB utility 
scilc.exe, likely to run malicious commands written in the SCIL (Supervisory 
Control Implementation Language) by ABB – that would switch off 
the substations on October 10, 2022.  
Based on the file timestamp analysis, Mandiant believes the actors needed 
2 months to develop the OT capability. Loading the ISO image was possible

because the virtual machine that the MicroSCADA was running on had 
the autorun feature enabled, allowing CD-ROMs, physical or virtual (e.g. an ISO 
file), to run automatically. The scilc.exe utility is part of the MicroSCADA 
software suite, and Sandworm used it to run SCIL commands that the server 
would convert to IEC 101/104 commands and relay them to the remote terminal 
units in the substation. According to the researchers' findings, the compromised 
MicroSCADA server was running an end-of-life software version that allowed 
default access to the SCIL-API. Using a native binary in the attack indicates 
the hackers’ shift to living-off-the-land (LoL/LOTL) techniques that rely 
on more lightweight and generic tools, which make threat activity more difficult 
to detect. 
Then, on October 12, 2022, Sandworm deployed a new version 
of the CADDYWIPER data-destroying malware, perhaps in an attempt 
to hamper analysis of the intrusion. Mandiant did not reveal the location 
of the targeted energy facility, or the length and scale of the blackout. 
Other 
RedEnergy attacks  
Zscaler ThreatLabz researchers discovered .NET RedEnergy malware used 
in attacks on enterprises in the energy, oil and gas, telecom, and machinery 
industries. The malware allows attackers to steal information from various 
browsers, and also has ransomware functionality (Stealer-as-a-Ransomware). 
The attackers use the FAKEUPDATES tactic to deceive victims and force them 
to download RedEnergy malware disguised as browser updates. The attackers 
used LinkedIn pages to target victims and redirect them to a fraudulent URL 
using quite authoritative profile pages, including Philippines Industrial Machinery 
Manufacturing Company and several organizations in Brazil.  
The malware operates through multiple stages, starting with the execution 
of disguised malicious executables. It establishes persistence, communicates 
with DNS servers, and downloads additional payloads from remote locations. 
RedStealer communicates with servers over HTTPS, stores itself in the Windows 
startup directory, and creates a start menu entry. The researchers also found 
suspicious activity related to the File Transfer Protocol (FTP), which suggests 
that it’s used by attackers to steal data. After a successful attack, a module 
is used to encrypt data with the addition of the .FACKOFF! extension 
to encrypted files, deleting backup copies along the way.

QR code phishing campaign 
Researchers at Cofense identified a phishing campaign that uses malicious 
QR codes to steal Microsoft account credentials. The campaign has been 
operating since at least May 2023. One of the targets is an unnamed U.S. energy 
company that received about 29% of the over 1,000 emails.  
Most of the phishing emails appear to be Microsoft security notifications. 
Top organizations were in manufacturing, insurance, technology, and financial 
services that received 15%, 9%, 7%, and 6% of the emails, respectively.  
Most of the identified phishing links were Bing redirect URLs (26%), followed 
by two domains associated with the Salesforce application (15%) 
and Cloudflare’s Web3 services. The use of Bing URL redirects, coupled 
with hiding the phishing links in QR codes embedded in images or documents 
and other obfuscation tactics, helped the malicious messages bypass security 
controls and land in the recipients’ inboxes.  
Cofense researchers didn’t attribute the new campaign to a specific actor. 
Mysterious Team Bangladesh attacks 
Group-IB Threat Intelligence researchers analyzed the activities of hacktivist 
group Mysterious Team Bangladesh. This group, which typically targets logistics, 
government, and financial sectors in India and Israel (and, to a lesser extent, 
in Australia, Senegal, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Ethiopia), has been linked 
to more than 750 DDoS attacks and 78 website defacements since June 2022. 
The threat actor, thought to be Bangladeshi in origin, reportedly also gained 
access to web servers and administrative panels, probably by exploiting known 
security flaws (like vulnerable versions of PHPMyAdmin and WordPress) 
or poorly-secured passwords. 
Cuba ransomware attacks 
Kaspersky researchers presented an analysis of Cuba ransomware about 
the history of the group and typical TTPs.  
The group first came to attention in 2020 when it was called Tropical Scorpius. 
Cuba targeted organizations in the U.S., Canada, Australia, and Europe with 
a series of high-profile attacks on oil companies, manufacturing, financial 
services, government agencies, healthcare providers, and others.  
The group uses a classic double extortion model, stealing and then encrypting 
data using the Xsalsa20 symmetric algorithm, and the encryption key uses 
the asymmetric RSA-2048 algorithm. The ransomware encrypts documents,

images, and archives. It also stops all SQL services to encrypt all available 
databases, and searches for data both locally and within network shares.  
In addition to encryption, the group steals sensitive data that it discovers inside 
the victim’s organization. The type of data that hackers look for depends 
on the industry of the target company. The group uses both well-known classic 
credential access tools and custom applications: Bughatch, Burntcigar, 
Cobeacon, Hancitor (Chanitor), Termite, SystemBC, Veeamp, Wedgecut, 
RomCOM RAT, Mimikatz, PowerShell, PsExec, and Remote Desktop Protocol. 
Already known software vulnerabilities are mainly exploited, such as 
the combination of ProxyShell and ProxyLogon to attack Exchange servers, 
as well as security holes in the Veeam data backup and recovery service.  
In the report, Kaspersky researchers present the results of an investigation into 
one of the incidents with an emphasis on analysis of previously undocumented 
software, group TTPs, and also share IoCs, Sigma, and YARA rules. 
Core Werewolf attacks 
Researchers from BI.ZONE Threat Intelligence reported new attacks by the Core 
Werewolf group in their Telegram channel, targeting enterprises in the defense 
and energy industries in Russia, as well as other critical infrastructure facilities 
for espionage purposes.  
The attackers sent emails with an attached UKAZ.PDF.ZIP archive, which 
contained an executable malicious file named “О предоставлении информации 
по согласованию и наградам.exe” (“On the provision of information 
on approvals and awards.exe”). The executable file is a self-extracting archive 
that, when launched, displays the expected PDF or Microsoft Word document 
on the victim's screen. In the last identified campaign, it was a document 
with an order from the deputy general director of a well-known industrial 
company. At the same time, a legitimate UltraVNC tool is installed 
in the background that allows the attackers to gain full control 
over the compromised device.  
According to BI.ZONE, Core Werewolf has been active since at least 
December 2021, and its TTPs were shared previously. 
Attacks on Russian industrial organizations 
Researchers at Kaspersky Lab reported an espionage campaign targeting 
a number of Russian government and industrial organizations using a custom 
backdoor written in Go.  
  
  
 
 
 
APT AND FINANCIAL ATTACKS ON INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATIONS  
IN H2 2023 
 
21 
© 2024 AO KASPERSKY LAB 
 
The attack vector began with an email with a malicious archive named 
finansovyy_kontrol_2023_180529.rar. The archive contained a decoy PDF used 
to distract the victim, as well as an NSIS script that extracts and runs 
the backdoor from an external URL.  
The functionality of the backdoor is limited to spyware and is mainly focused 
on searching for files of certain extensions and reading the contents 
of the clipboard. All data sent to C2 is encrypted with AES, and the malware 
checks the environment it’s located in to avoid analysis. The results of these 
checks are sent to C2 at the initial stage of infection and are used to profile 
the victim.  
Malicious activity was detected in June 2023, and in mid-August, researchers 
discovered a new version of the malware. The updated malware provided 
improved evasion of security measures, which indicates ongoing systematic 
work to optimize attacks. 
XDSpy attacks 
F.A.C.C.T. researchers report that the XDSpy APT group attacks Russian 
metallurgists and military-industrial complex enterprises. New malicious mailings 
were discovered on November 21-22 addressed to a Russian metallurgical 
enterprise, as well as a research institute specializing in the development 
of military missiles. In both cases, the email signature displayed the logo 
of a nuclear research institute, and the email address of a logistics company 
from Kaliningrad was indicated as the sender. In addition, another email was 
discovered sent to Russian metallurgists, but from a Belarusian address. 
The group’s Kill Chain of the new November campaign corresponds 
to the previously described XDSpy attacks. The emails contain a link to a PDF 
that leads to downloading a malicious ZIP archive. The archive contains an lnk file 
and a command line file, which ultimately results in the C# code being compiled 
into malicious .NET payloads and launched. XDSpy’s victimology correlates 
with previous targets among military, financial, energy, research, and mining 
companies in the Russian Federation.  
Despite the fact that APT has been active since 2011, international researchers 
still don’t know in the interests of which country it works. 
DarkWatchman RAT attacks 
F.A.C.C.T. researchers detected a new campaign using the fileless 
JavaScript-based DarkWatchman associated with attacks on Russian 
companies under the guise of mailings from the Pony Express courier delivery

service. The list included 30 recipients from banking institutions, marketplaces, 
telecom operators, agricultural and fuel and energy companies, and logistics 
and IT companies.  
In the messages, the recipient is informed that the free storage period for their 
packages has expired, while the attached archive with the invoice contains 
the malicious DarkWatchman RAT. The emails were sent 
from the ponyexpress[.]site domain, which has previously been used for phishing. 
Moreover, the multi-line phone number indicated in the email actually belongs 
to the Pony Express courier service.  
The DarkWatchman RAT has long been observed targeting Russian entities. 
Previously, DarkWatchman RAT operators distributed malware under the guise 
of an archive with the results of a fake tender from the Russian Ministry 
of Defense, fake summonses from the military registration and enlistment office, 
and also through the fake website of a Russian developer in the field 
of cryptography. 
Hellhounds attacks 
Positive Technologies researchers have uncovered the activities of a new group, 
Hellhounds, which is aimed at Russian commercial and government organizations. 
The campaign was called Operation Lahat because telemetry from infected 
hosts was sent to an account with the username “lahat”.  
Research started in October 2023, when PT CSIRT discovered the compromise 
of an energy company using the Decoy Dog trojan. Decoy Dog has been used 
in attacks against Russian organizations since at least September 2022. 
However, the sample found on the victim’s host was a new, more refined 
modification of the trojan.  
Researchers reported that Hellhounds makes significant efforts to hide their 
activity on hosts and the network. At the first stage, attackers use the Decoy 
Dog Loader, which is protected by a modified version of the UPX packer. Unlike 
regular UPX, this modification does not unpack an executable file, but rather 
a shellcode written entirely in the assembly language and using only Linux system 
calls. The loader itself runs on the system and disguises itself as a legitimate cron 
service. The second stage uses the main payload, which is a modified version 
of Pupy RAT (a cross-platform multi-functional backdoor) that researchers call 
Decoy Dog. 
At least 20 Russian organizations have been affected, most of which 
are in the public sector, information technology, space industry and energy 
sector, but also including construction, transportation, and logistics companies.

TTP’s analysis didn’t allow researchers to link the attackers to any previously 
known APT groups.  
According to PT, Hellhounds are involved in hacking a Russian 
telecommunications operator where they managed to put some of its services 
out of operation. This was reported by Solar 4RAYS researchers as part of their 
presentation "Thanos' blip for the telecom operator" at SOC-Forum 2023. 
Cloud Atlas attacks 
F.A.C.C.T. researchers discovered a new cyber espionage campaign 
by the Cloud Atlas APT group (aka Clean Ursa, Inception, Oxygen) targeting 
a Russian agro-industrial enterprise and a state-owned research company. 
The threat actor is known for its persistent campaigns targeting Russia, Belarus, 
Azerbaijan, Turkey, and Slovenia.  
The starting point of the new campaign are phishing messages under the guise 
of supporting participants in the Special Military Operation and military 
registration with a lure document that exploits CVE-2017-11882, a six-year-old 
memory corruption flaw in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor, a technique Cloud 
Atlas has employed as early as October 2018. The emails originate from popular 
Russian email services Yandex Mail and VK's Mail.ru. Successful exploitation 
of the vulnerability leads to executing a shellcode that's responsible 
for downloading and running an obfuscated HTA file. The downloaded malicious 
HTML application subsequently launches Visual Basic Script (VBS) files that 
are ultimately responsible for retrieving and executing an unknown VBS code 
from a remote server. At the time of the study, the next stage VBS code 
was unavailable.  
Grayling attacks 
Symantec researchers shared evidence of a new APT group dubbed “Grayling” 
that targeted mainly Taiwanese organizations in a cyber-espionage campaign 
lasting at least four months. The group’s activity began in February 2023 
and continued until at least May 2023, stealing sensitive information 
from manufacturing, IT, and biomedical companies in Taiwan, as well as victims 
in the U.S., Vietnam, and Pacific Islands.  
The group deployed DLL side-loading through the exported API SbieDll_Hook 
to load tools such as a Cobalt Strike Stager leading to the popular post-
exploitation tool Cobalt Strike Beacon. It also installed “Havoc”, an open-source, 
post-exploitation command-and-control (C2) framework used in a similar way 
to Cobalt Strike. Grayling used the publicly available spyware tool NetSpy, 
exploited legacy Windows elevation of privileges bug CVE-2019-0803,

and downloaded and executed shellcode, the report noted. Other post-
exploitation activities carried out by these attackers includes using kill processes 
to kill all processes listed in a file called processlist.txt and using Mimikatz 
for credential-dumping. 
Attack against Danish critical infrastructure 
Denmark’s SektorCERT reported a simultaneous cyberattack on 22 companies 
associated with the country’s energy sector on May 11, 2023. Among the shared 
details was that one organization lost visibility into three of its remote locations 
and the organization's employees had to drive out to all that locations.  
The attackers exploited a critical command injection vulnerability (CVE-2023-28771) 
affecting Zyxel firewalls. Eleven companies were successfully compromised: the 
threat actors executed malicious code to conduct reconnaissance of the firewall 
configurations and determine the next course of action. Some of the deployed 
payloads were related to the Mirai Moobot variant.  
The agency has attributed the attacks or at least part of them to Sandworm 
(aka Hades), but without complete certainty. The traffic in one of the affected 
organizations was linked to an IP address that had previously been used 
by Sandworm. However, SektorCERT insisted that attribution could not be made 
with confidence due to the overall lack of evidence. 
AeroBlade attacks 
BlackBerry researchers discovered a previously unknown cyber espionage 
hacking group dubbed AeroBlade targeting organizations in the U.S. aerospace 
sector. The campaign unfolded in two phases: a testing wave in September 2022, 
and a more advanced attack in July 2023.  
The attacks employed spear-phishing with weaponized documents dropping 
a reverse-shell payload. In both attacks, a reverse shell connected to the same 
C2 IP address, and the threat actors used the same lure documents 
in the phishing stage. The final reverse shell of the 2023 attack was stealthier, 
used more obfuscation and anti-analysis techniques, and included an option 
to list directories from infected victims.  
BlackBerry assesses with medium to high confidence that the goal 
of the attacks was commercial cyber espionage aiming to gather 
valuable information.

USB attacks with Vetta Loader 
In an investigation conducted by Yoroi’s malware ZLab team, a persistent threat 
was unveiled affecting several Italian companies, primarily in the industrial, 
manufacturing, and digital printing sectors. The modus operandi of this threat 
involves the utilization of infected USB drives, exploiting the heavy reliance 
on pen-drives for data sharing within these sectors.  
Researchers identified at least four different variants of the same malware 
loader dubbed Vetta Loader being launched as part of an infection chain using 
USB drives, all written in different programming languages: NodeJS, Golang, 
Python, and .NET. All of them work with the same logic to communicate with C2s 
and then download other payloads. The final downloaded payloads were 
no longer available at the time of analysis. The initial USB Infector responsible 
for infecting the USB devices along with other modules capable of collecting 
systeminfo and Bitcoin clipper malware were found.  
Yoroi researchers say with a medium-high level of confidence that the attacks 
were implemented by an Italian-speaking threat actor. 
CISA alerts 
CISA advisory on CVE-2022-47966 and CVE-2022-42475 
The attacks on a U.S. aeronautical organization were detailed in an advisory 
authored by the CISA, FBI, and the Cyber National Mission Force (CNMF). 
The attacks are believed to have begun in January.  
The advisory stated that nation-state advanced persistent threat (APT) groups 
were exploiting a critical remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2022-47966) 
to gain unauthorized access to the organization’s Zoho ManageEngine 
ServiceDesk Plus instance, then moving laterally through their network. 
Other APT groups exploited a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability 
(CVE-2022-42475) in FortiOS SSL-VPN to establish presence 
on the organization’s Fortinet firewall device.  
Through the Zoho exploit, the threat actors were able to achieve root level 
web server access and create a local user account with administrative privileges. 
Actors were further able to download malware, enumerate the network, collect 
administrative user credentials, and move laterally through 
the organization’s network.

It was unclear if the attacks resulted in data being accessed, altered, or exfiltrated 
due to the organization not clearly defining where their data was centrally located 
and the CISA having limited network coverage. 
The advisory did not attribute the attack to any specific threat groups, 
but noted CISA’s investigation uncovered overlapping tactics, techniques 
and procedures (TTPs) that could be ascribed to multiple APT groups. 
CISA advisory on Snatch Ransomware 
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure 
Security Agency (CISA) released a joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) 
to disseminate known ransomware IOCs and TTPs associated with the Snatch 
ransomware variant identified through FBI investigations as recently as 
June 1, 2023.  
The alert warned of the threat actor targeting a wide range of critical 
infrastructure sectors, including the IT sector, the U.S. defense industrial base, 
and the food and agriculture vertical.  
Since mid-2021, Snatch threat actors have consistently evolved their tactics 
to take advantage of current trends in the cybercriminal space and have been 
observed purchasing previously stolen data from other ransomware groups 
in an attempt to further exploit victims into paying a ransom to avoid having 
their data released on Snatch's extortion blog.  
In many attacks, Snatch operators have targeted weaknesses in the Remote 
Desktop Protocol (RDP) to gain administrator-level access to a target network. 
In other instances, they have used stolen or purchased credentials to gain 
an initial foothold. Once on a network, the threat actor can sometimes spend up 
to three months moving around the network searching for files and folders 
to target.  
The FBI and CISA advisory described Snatch operators as using a combination 
of legitimate and malicious tools on compromised networks. These include post-
compromise tools such as the Metasploit open-source penetration testing tool, 
Cobalt Strike for later movement, and utilities such as sc.exe to create, query, 
add, and delete services and perform other tasks. 
CISA alert on BlackTech attacks 
A joint advisory from the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), FBI, 
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Japan National Police 
Agency (NPA), and Japan National Center of Incident Readiness and Strategy 
for Cybersecurity (NISC) warned that a threat group called BlackTech

(a.k.a. Palmerworm, Temp.Overboard, Circuit Panda, and Radio Panda) has been 
stealthily modifying Cisco IOS router firmware and taking advantage of routers’ 
domain-trust relationships to move/traverse from subsidiary organizations 
to primary target organizations in the U.S. and Japan. The hacks targeted 
government agencies, as well as industrial, technology, media, electronics, 
and telecommunication companies.  
In the advisory, the agencies said BlackTech used the attacks to deploy 
a customized firmware backdoor. The backdoor functionality is enabled 
and disabled through specially crafted TCP or UDP packets. They urged 
multinational organizations to review all network connections with their 
subsidiary offices and listed a range of security measures they should take 
to mitigate the APT gang’s potential risk. 
Cisco has released a bulletin noting that the most prevalent initial access vector 
in these attacks involves stolen or weak administrative credentials. There was 
no indication that any Cisco vulnerabilities were exploited.  
CISA alert on Rhysida ransomware 
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Multi-State Information Sharing 
and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) released a joint alert that provides defenders 
with Rhysida Ransomware indicators of compromise (IOCs), detection 
information, and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) discovered during 
investigations as of September 2023.  
The threat actors behind the Rhysida ransomware engage in opportunistic 
attacks targeting organizations in various industry sectors. Observed 
as a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) model, Rhysida actors have compromised 
organizations in education, manufacturing, information technology, 
and government sectors since May 2023, and any ransom paid is split between 
the group and affiliates.  
Rhysida actors leverage external-facing remote services, such as VPNs, 
Zerologon vulnerability (CVE-2020-1472), and phishing campaigns to gain initial 
access and persistence within a network. It's also said to share overlaps 
with another ransomware crew known as Vice Society (aka Storm-0832 
or Vanilla Tempest).

CISA alert on LockBit 3.0 ransomware 
On November 21, 2023, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency 
(CISA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Multi-State Information Sharing 
& Analysis Center (MS-ISAC), and Australian Signals Directorate’s Australian 
Cyber Security Center (ASD’s ACSC) released a joint alert that disseminates 
Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs), 
and detection methods associated with LockBit 3.0 ransomware exploiting 
CVE-2023-4966, labeled Citrix Bleed, affecting Citrix NetScaler web application 
delivery control (ADC) and NetScaler Gateway appliances. The vulnerability 
allows adversaries to bypass password requirements and multi-factor 
authentication (MFA), allowing them to take control of user sessions 
on Citrix NetScaler ADC and Gateway appliances.  
LockBit is a ransomware family active since September 2019 that operates 
under the Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) model. LockBit 3.0 affiliates have 
conducted attacks against organizations of varying sizes across multiple critical 
infrastructure sectors, including education, energy, financial services, food 
and agriculture, government and emergency services, healthcare, manufacturing, 
and transportation. 
CISA alert on CyberAv3ngers attacks 
The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Federal Bureau 
of Investigation (FBI), NSA, EPA, and Israel’s National Cyber Directorate 
published a joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) on December 14 on the threat 
actor calling itself CyberAv3ngers responsible for the attack on the Municipal 
Water Authority of Aliquippa in Pennsylvania. In addition to the November CISA 
alert, the authoring agencies released the joint CSA to share indicators 
of compromise (IOCs) and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) 
associated with the actor’s cyber operations.  
The actor is focused on targeting and compromising Israeli-made Unitronics 
Vision Series programmable logic controllers (PLCs). These PLCs are commonly 
used in the Water and Wastewater Systems (WWS) Sector and additionally 
used in other industries including, but not limited to, energy, food and beverage 
manufacturing, and healthcare. Once the devices are compromised, the hackers 
defaced their user interface, potentially making the PLC inoperable.  
The agencies said IRGC-affiliated threat actors targeted multiple U.S. water 
sector facilities that rely on Unitronics Vision PLCs since November 22. 
The victims were located in multiple states.

CISA alert on Star Blizzard  
In a joint advisory published on December 7, the “Five Eyes” security agencies 
(the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) in coordination 
with the United Kingdom’s National Cyber Security Centre (UK-NCSC), 
Australian Signals Directorate’s Australian Cyber Security Centre (ASD’s ACSC), 
Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (CCCS), New Zealand National Cyber 
Security Centre (NCSC-NZ), and the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), 
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and Cyber Command Cyber National 
Mission Force (CNMF)) warned about the evolving phishing techniques employed 
by Star Blizzard and its targeting of individuals and organizations, including 
the U.S. government and defense industrial base.  
The alert shares the group’s tactics and techniques based on real-world 
observations. The attacker uses typical phishing tradecraft and shares a link 
in an email message or document allegedly leading to a document or website 
of interest. This leads the target to an actor-controlled server, prompting 
the target to enter account credentials.  
Star Blizzard uses the open-source framework EvilGinx in their spear-phishing 
activity, which allows them to harvest credentials and session cookies 
to successfully bypass the use of two-factor authentication. Star Blizzard 
then uses the stolen credentials to log in to a target’s email account, where they 
are known to access and steal emails and attachments from the victim’s inbox. 
They have also set up mail-forwarding rules, giving them ongoing visibility of 
victim correspondence, and have also used compromised email accounts 
for further phishing activity.
