By Gi7w0rm, Asheer Malhotra and Vitor Ventura. 
Cisco Talos is disclosing a new malware campaign called “Operation Celestial Force” running since at least
2018. It is still active today, employing the use of GravityRAT, an Android-based malware, along with a
Windows-based malware loader we track as “HeavyLift.”  
All GravityRAT and HeavyLift infections are administered by a standalone tool we are calling “GravityAdmin,”
which carries out malicious activities on an infected device. Analysis of the panel binaries reveals that they are
meant to administer and run multiple campaigns at the same time, all of which are codenamed and have their
own admin panels.  
Talos attributes this operation with high confidence to a Pakistani nexus of threat actors we’re calling “Cosmic
Leopard,” focused on espionage and surveillance of their targets.  This multiyear operation continuously
targeted Indian entities and individuals likely belonging to defense, government and related technology spaces.
Talos initially disclosed the use of the Windows-based GravityRAT malware by suspected Pakistani threat
actors in 2018 — also used to target Indian entities.  
While this operation has been active for at least the past six years, Talos has observed a general uptick in the
threat landscape in recent years, with respect to the use of mobile malware for espionage to target high-value
targets, including the use of commercial spyware. 
Operation Celestial Force: A multi-campaign, multi-component infections operation 
Talos assesses with high confidence that this series of campaigns we’re clustering under the umbrella of “Operation
Celestial Force” is conducted by a nexus of Pakistani threat actors. The tactics, techniques, tooling and victimology of
Cosmic Leopard contain some overlaps with those of Transparent Tribe, another suspected Pakistani APT group,
which has a history of targeting high-value individuals from the Indian subcontinent. However, we do not have enough
technical evidence to link both the threat actors together for now, therefore we track this cluster of activity under the
“Cosmic Leopard” tag. 
Operation Celestial Force has been active since at least 2018 and continues to operate today — increasingly utilizing
an expanding and evolving malware suite — indicating that the operation has likely seen a high degree of success
targeting users in the Indian subcontinent. Cosmic Leopard initially began the operation with the creation and
2/11
deployment of the Windowsbased GravityRAT malware family distributed via malicious documents (maldocs). Cosmic
Leopard then created Android-based versions of GravityRAT to widen their net of infections to begin targeting mobile
devices around 2019. During the same year, Cosmic Leopard also expanded their arsenal to use the HeavyLift
malware family as a malware loader. HeavyLift is primarily wrapped in malicious installers sent to targets tricked into
running the into running the malware via social engineering techniques. 
Some campaigns from this multi-year operation have been disclosed and loosely attributed to Pakistani threat actors
in previous reporting. However, there has been little evidence to tie all of them together until now. Each campaign in
the operation has been codenamed by the threat actor and managed/administered using custom-built panel binaries
we call “GravityAdmin.” 
Adversaries like Cosmic Leopard may use low-sophistication techniques such as social engineering and spear
phishing, but will aggressively target potential victims with various TTPs. Therefore, organizations must remain
vigilant against such motivated adversaries conducting targeted attacks by educating users on proper cyber hygiene
and implementing defense-in-depth models to protect against such attacks across various attack surfaces.
Initiating contact and infecting targets 
This campaign primarily utilizes two infection vectors — spear phishing and social engineering. Spear phishing
consists of messages sent to targets with pertinent language and maldocs that contain malware such as GravityRAT. 
The other infection vector, gaining popularity in this operation, and now a staple tactic of the Cosmic Leopard’s
operations consists of contacting targets over social media channels, establishing trust with them and eventually
sending them a malicious link to download either the Windows- or Android-based GravityRAT or the Windows-based
loader, HeavyLift.

Operation Celestial Force’s malware and its management interfaces 
Talos’ analysis reveals the use of multiple components, including Android- and Windows-based malware, and
administrative binaries supporting multiple campaign panels used by Operation Celestial Force. 
GravityRAT: GravityRAT, a closed-source malware family, first disclosed by Talos in 2018, is a Windows- and
Android-based RAT used to target Indian entities.  
3/11
HeavyLift: A previously unknown Electron-based malware loader family distributed via malicious installers
targeting the Windows operating system.  
GravityAdmin: A tool to administer infected systems (panel binary), used by operators since at least 2021, by
connecting to GravityRAT’s and HeavyLift’s C2 servers. GravityAdmin consists of multiple inbuilt User
Interfaces (UIs) that correspond to specific, codenamed, campaigns being operated by malicious operators.   
Operation Celestial Force’s infection chains are:  
GravityAdmin: Panel binaries administering the campaigns 
The Panel binaries we analyzed consist of multiple versions with the earliest compiled in August 2021. The panel
binary asks for a user ID, password and campaign ID (from a drop-down menu) from the operator when it runs.  
4/11
 Login screen for GravityAdmin titled “Bits Before Bullets.”
When the operator clicks the login button, the executable will check if it is connected to the internet by sending a ping
request to www[.]google[.]com. Then, the user ID and password are authenticated with an authentication server
which sends back: 
A code to direct the panel binary to open the panel UI for the specified panel. 
Also sends a value back via the HTTP “Authorization” Header. This value acts as an authentication token when
communicating with campaign-specific[ C2 servers to load data such as a list of infected machines, etc. 
A typical Panel screen will list the machines infected as part of the specific campaign. It also has buttons to trigger
various malicious actions against one or more infected systems.  
5/11
Different panels have different capabilities, however, some core capabilities are common across all campaigns. 
The various campaigns configured in the Panel binaries are code named as: 
"SIERRA" 
"QUEBEC" 
"ZULU" 
"DROPPER" 
"WORDDROPPER" 
"COMICUM" 
"ROCKAMORE" 
"FOXTROT" 
"CLOUDINFINITY" 
"RECOVERBIN" 
"CVSCOUT" 
"WEBBUCKET" 
"CRAFTWITHME" 
"SEXYBER" 
"CHATICO" 
Each of the codenamed campaigns from the Panel binaries consists of its own infection mechanisms. For example,
“FOXTROT,” “CLOUDINFINITY” and “CHATICO” are names given to all Android-based GravityRAT infections
whereas “CRAFTWITHME,” “SEXYBER” and “CVSCOUT” are named for attacks deploying HeavyLift. Our analysis
correlates the campaigns listed above with the Operating Systems being targeted with respective malware families.

GravityRAT: A multi-platform remote access trojan
GravityRAT is a Windows-based remote access trojan first disclosed by Talos in 2018. GravityRAT was later ported to
the Android operating system to target mobile devices around 2019. Since 2019, we’ve observed a continuous
addition of a multitude of capabilities in GravityRAT and its associated infrastructure. So far, we have observed the
use of GravityRAT exclusively by suspected Pakistani threat actors to target entities and individuals in India. There is
currently no publicly available evidence to suggest that GravityRAT is a commodity/open-source malware, suggesting
its potential use by multiple, disparate threat actors. 
Our analysis of the entire ecosystem of Operation Celestial Force revealed that GravityRAT’s use in this campaign
likely began as early as 2016 and continues to this day. 
The latest variants of GravityRAT are distributed through malicious websites, some registered and set up as late as
early January 2024, pretending to distribute legitimate Android applications. Malicious operators will distribute the
download links to their targets over social media channels asking them to download and install the malware. 
The latest variants of GravityRAT use the previously mentioned code names to define the campaigns. The
screenshot below shows the initial registration of a victim into the C2, getting back a list of alternative C2 to be used,
if needed.  
 The group uses Cloudflare service to hide the true location of their C2 servers.
After registration, the trojan requests tasks to execute to the C2 followed by uploading a file containing the device's
location.  
The trojan will use a different user-agent for each request — it's unclear if this is done on purpose, or if this anomaly
is just the result of cut-and-paste code from other projects to tie together this trojan’s features.  
GravityRAT requests the following permissions on the device for stealing information and housekeeping tasks. 
7/11
These variants of GravityRAT are similar to previously disclosed versions from ESET and Cyble and consist of the
following capabilities: 
1. Send preliminary information about the device to the C2. This information includes IMEI, phone number,
network country ISO code, network operator name, SIM country ISO code, SIM operator name, SIM serial
number, device model, brand, product and manufacturer, addresses surrounding the obtained longitude and
latitude of the device and the current build information, including release, host, etc. 
2. Read SMS data and content and upload to the C2. 
3. Read specific file formats and upload them to the C2. 
4. Read call logs and upload them to the C2. 
5. Obtain IMEI information including associated email ID and send it to C2. 
6. Delete all contacts, call logs and files related to the malware. 
HeavyLift: Electron-based malware loader
Some of the campaigns in this operation use Electron-based malware loaders we’re calling “HeavyLift,” which consist
of JavaScript code communicating and controlled by C2 servers. These are the same C2 servers that interact with
GravityAdmin, the panel tool used by the operators to govern infected systems. HeavyLift is essentially a stage one
malware component that downloads and installs other malicious implants whenever available on the C2 server.
HeavyLift bears some similarities with GravityRAT’s Electron versions disclosed previously by Kaspersky in 2020. 
A HeavyLift infection begins with an executable masquerading as an installer for a legitimate application. The installer
installs a dummy application but also installs and sets up a malicious Electron-based desktop application. This
malicious application is, in fact, HeavyLift and consists of JavaScript code that carries out malicious operations on the
infected system. 
On execution, HeavyLift will check if it is running on a macOS or Windows system. If it is running on macOS, and not
running as root, it will execute with admin privileges using the command: 
 /usr/bin/osascript -e 'do shell script "bash -c " _process_path " with administrator 
privileges'  
If it is running as root, it will set the default HTTP User-Agent to “M_9C9353252222ABD88B123CE5A78B70F6”, then
get system info using the commands: 
8/11
system_profiler SPHardwareDataType | grep 'Model Name' 
system_profiler SPHardwareDataType | grep 'SMC' 
system_profiler SPHardwareDataType | grep 'Model Identifier' 
system_profiler SPHardwareDataType | grep 'ROM' 
system_profiler SPHardwareDataType | grep 'Serial Number'  
For a Windows-based system, the HTTP User-Agent is set to “W_9C9353252222ABD88B123CE5A78B70F6”. The
malware will then obtain preliminary system information such as: 
Processor ID 
MAC address 
Installed anti-virus product name 
Username 
Domain name 
Platform information 
Process, OS architecture 
Agent (hardcoded value) 
OS release number 
All this preliminary information is sent to the hardcoded C2 server URL to register the infection with the C2. 
HeavyLift will then reach out to the C2 server to poll for any new payloads to execute on the infected system. A
payload received from the C2 will be dropped to a directory in the “AppData” directory and persisted on the system. 
On macOS, the payload is a ZIP file that is extracted, and the resulting binary persists using crontab via the
command: 
crontab -l 2>/dev/null; echo ' */2 * * * * “_filepath_” _arguments_ ‘ | crontab - 
For Windows, the payload received is an EXE file that persists on the system via a scheduled task. The malware will
create an XML file for the scheduled tasks with the payload path, arguments and working directory and then use the
XML to set up the schedtask: 
SCHTASKS /Create /XML "_xmlpath_" /TN "_taskname_" /F 
The malware will then open the accompanying HTML file via web view to appear legitimate. 
 In some cases, the malware will also perform anti-analysis checks to see if it’s running in a virtual environment.  
It checks for the presence of specific keywords before closing if there is a match: 
Innotek GmbH 
VirtualBox 
VMware 
Microsoft Corporation 
HITACHI
These keywords are checked against model information, SMC, ROM and serial numbers on macOS and Windows
against manufacturer information, such as product, vendor, processor and more.
