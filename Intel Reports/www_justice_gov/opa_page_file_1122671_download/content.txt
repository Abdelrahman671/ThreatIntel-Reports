The Grand Jury charges: 
OVERVIEW 
1. 
At all times relevant to this Indictment, ZHU HUA 
(:~~), a/k/a "Afwar," a/k/a "CVNX," a/k/a "Alayos," a/k/a 
"Godkiller, II and ZHANG SHILONG (s*±ft) I a/k/a "Baobeilong, II 
a/k/a "Zhang Jianguo," a/k/a "Atreexp," the defendants, both of 
whom were nationals of the People's Republic of China ("China"), 
were membe rs of a hacking group operating in China known within 
the cyber security community as Advanced Persistent Threat 10 
(the "APTl0 Group") 1 
or alternatively as "Red Apollo 1
" 
"CVNX,"
1 
"Stone Panda," "MenuPass," and "POTASSIUM." 
2. 
From at least in or about 2006 up to and including in 
or about 2018 1 members of the APTl0 Group, including ZHU HUA, 
a/k/a "Afwar," a/k/a "CVNX," a/k/a "Alayos," a/k/a "Godkiller," 
and ZHANG SHILONG, a/k/a "Baobeilong 1 
" a/k/a "Zhang Jianguo, 
11 
a/k/a "Atreexp," the defendants, conducted extensive campaigns 
of global intrusions into computer systems. 
The defendants 
worked for Huaying Haitai Science and Technology Development 
Company ("Huaying Haitai") in Tianjin, China, and acted in 
association with the Chinese Ministry of State Security's 
Tianjin State Security Bureau. 
3. 
While the APTl0 Group employed similar hacking tools 
and techniques over the course of its campaigns,· the APTl0 
Group's hacking operations evolved over time 1 demonstrating 
advances in overcoming network defenses, victim selection, and 
tradecraft. 
Moreover, the APTl0 Group utilized some of the same 
online facilities to initiate 1 facilitate, and execute its 
APT is a designation given in the cyber security community to 
an individual or group that uses sophisticated techniques to 
exploit vulnerabilities in victim computer systems and employs 
an external command and control system to target a specific 
entity or range of entities and maintain a persistent presence 
on its targets' networks. 
2 
1 
campaigns during the conspiracy, thereby reflecting the APTl0 
Group's continuous and unrelenting effort, from in or about 2006 
up to and including in or about 2018, to steal technologies and 
other information of value to the conspiracy. 
For example, as 
detailed herein, the APTl0 Group was engaged in at least two 
computer intrusion campaigns during the relevant time period, 
both aiming to steal, among other data, intellectual property 
and confidential business or technological information: 
a. 
First, beginning in or about 2006, members of the 
APTl0 Group, including ZHU HUA, a/k/a "Afwar," a/k/a "CVNX," 
a/k/a "Alayos," a/k/a "Godkiller," and ZHANG SHILONG, a/k/a 
"Baobeilong," a/k/a "Zhang Jianguo," a/k/a "Atreexp," the 
defendants, engaged in an intrusion campaign to obtain 
unauthorized access to the computers and computer networks of 
commerc(ial and defense technology companies and U.S. Government 
agencies in order to steal information and data concerning a 
number of technologies (the "Technology Theft Campaign"). 
Specifically, the APTl0 Groµp obtained unauthorized access to 
the computers of more than 45 such entities based in at least 12 
states, including Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, 
Maryland, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Virginia, 
and Wisconsin. 
Through the Technology Theft Campaign, the APTl0 
3 
Group stole hundreds of gigabytes of sensitive data and targeted 
the computers of victim companies involved in a diverse array of 
commercial activity, industries, and technologies, including 
aviation, space and satellite technology, manufacturing 
technology, pharmaceutical technology, oil and gas exploration 
and production technology, communications technology, computer 
processor technology, and maritime technology. 
b. 
Second, beginning at least in or about 2014, 
members of the APTlO Group, in~luding ZHU and ZHANG, engaged in 
an intrusion campaign to obtain unauthorized access to the 
computers and computer networks of managed service providers 
("MSPs") for businesses and governments around the world (the 
"MSP Theft Campaign"). 
MSPs are companies that remotely manage 
their clients' information technology infrastructure, including 
by providing computer servers, storage, networking, consulting 
and information technology support . 
The APTlO Group targeted 
MSPs in order to leverage the MSPs' networks to gain 
unauthorized access to the computers and computer networks of 
the MSPs' clients and steal, among other data, intellectual 
property and confidential business data on a global scale. 
For 
example, through the MSP Theft Campaign, the APTlO Group 
obtained unauthorized access to the computers of an MSP that had 
4 
offices in the Southern District of New York and compromised the 
data of that MSP and certain of its clients located in at least 
12 countries, including Brazil, Canada, Finland, France, 
Germany, India, Japan, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Arab 
Emirates, the United Kingdom, and the United States. 
Those 
compromised clients included companies that were involved in a 
diverse array of commercial activity, industries, and 
technologies, including banking and finance, telecommunications 
and consumer electronics, medical equipment, packaging, 
manufacturing, consulting, healthcare, biotechnology, 
automotive, oil and gas exploration, and mining. 
c. 
In addition, the APTl0 Group compromised more 
than 40 computers in order to steal confidential data from those 
systems belonging to the United States Department of the Navy 
(the "Navy"), including the personally identifiable information 
of more than 100,000 Navy personnel. 
MEANS AND METHODS OF THE CONSPIRACY 
The Technology Theft Campaign 
4. 
Members of the APTl0 Group, including ZHU HUA, a/k/a 
"Afwar," a/k/a "CVNX," a/k/a "Alayos," a/k/a "Godkiller," and 
ZHANG SHILONG, a/k/a "Baobeilong," a/k/a "Zhang Jianguo," a/k/a 
"Atreexp," the defendants, engaged in the following stages of 
5 
activity to orchestrate and manage the computer intrusions 
committed during the Technology Theft Campaign, which are 
generally summarized below: 
a. 
First, members of the APTlO Group used a 
technique known as "spear phishing" to introduce malicious 
software ("malware") onto targeted computers. 
Members of the 
conspiracy sent customized emails to •intended targets with 
attached documents and files that would surreptitiously install 
malware if opened. 
In order to trick the recipients of the 
spear phishing emails into opening the attachments of the emails 
that installed the malware, the emails purported to be sent from 
legitimate email addresses, when in fact the emails were sent by 
members of the conspiracy. 
In addition, the content of the 
email messages and the filenames of the attachments appeared to 
be legitimate and contain information of interest to the 
recipients. 
For example, one spear phishing email purported to 
originate from an email address associated with a victim company 
("Victim-1") involved in communications technology, when it 
actually originated from a different account, which was 
unaffiliated with Victim-1 and logged in from a computer 
6 
assigned an Internet protocol ("IP") address 2 located in Tianjin, 
China under the control of the APTlO Group. 
That email, which 
was sent to employees of another victim company ("Victim-2") 
involved in helicopter manufacturing, had the subject line "C17 
Antenna problems," a malicious Microsoft Word attachment named 
"12-204 Side Load Testing.doc," and stated the following: 
"Please see the attached the files." 
When the attachment named 
"12-204 Side Load Testing.doc" was opened, malware was installed 
on the computer of Victim-2. 
By using these spear phishing 
methods, the conspirators intended to and did cause the 
recipients of the emails to open the attachments without 
arousing suspicion as to the source of the email or its 
attachments. 
b. 
Second, once a recipient of a spear phishing 
email opened the attachment to the email, the attachment 
installed malware on the victim's computer. 
The malware 
typically included customized variants of a remote access Trojan 
("RAT") including one known as "Poison Ivy" and keystroke 
loggers, which are programs that surreptitiously recorded 
Each electronic device or computer resource connected to the 
Internet must be assigned a unique IP address so that 
communications from or directed to that electronic device are 
routed properly. 
7 
2 
computer keystrokes to steal usernames and passwords as the user 
of the victim systems typed them. 
The malware was programmed to 
automatically communicate with domains that were assigned IP 
addresses of computers under the control of members of the APTlO 
Group, allowing them to maintain visibility and persistent 
remote access to the compromised computers over the Internet. 
In particular, the APTlO Group used dynamic Domain Name System 
("DNS") service providers to host their malicious domains, 
including a provider located in the Southern District of New 
York, which allowed the APTlO Group to route the pre-programmed 
malicious domains in their malware to different IP addresses of 
computers under their control. 
This mode of operation enabled 
the APTlO Group to frequently and rapidly change the IP 
addresses associated with their malicious domains without having 
to adjust the malware or domains already on a victim's 
computers, providing the APTlO Group with operational 
flexibility and persistence, as well as helping them avoid 
detection by bypassing network security filters that might block 
identified malicious IP addresses. 
c. 
Third, after the malware was successfully 
installed, the APTlO Group downloaded additional malware and 
8 
tools to compromised computer systems in order to further 
compromise the victim's computers. 
d. 
Fourth, after the APTl0 Group had gained 
unauthorized access to a victim's computers and identified data 
of interest on those computers, the APTl0 Group collected the 
relevant files and other information from the compromised 
computers and exfiltrated the stolen files and information in 
encrypted archives to computers under their control. 
5. 
Over the course of the Technology Theft Campaign, the 
defendants and their coconspirators successfully obtained 
unauthorized access to at least approximately 90 computers 
belonging to, among others, commercial and defense technology 
companies and U.S. Government agencies located in at least 12 
states, and stole hundreds of gigabytes of sensitive data and 
information from their computer systems, including from at least 
the following victims: 
a. 
seven companies involved in aviation, space 
and/or satellite technology; 
b. 
three companies involved in communications 
technology; 
9 
c. 
three companies involved in manufacturing 
advanced electronic systems and/or laboratory analytical 
instruments; 
d. 
a company involved in maritime technology; 
e. 
a company involved in oil and gas drilling, 
production, and processing; 
f. 
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
("NASA") Goddard Space Center; and 
g. 
The NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. 
6. 
In addition to the above victims, the defendants and 
their coconspirators successfully obtained unauthorized access 
to computers belonging to at least 25 other technology-related 
companies involved in, among other things, industrial factory 
automation, radar technology, oil exploration, information 
technology services, pharmaceutical manufacturing, and computer 
processor technology, as well as the U.S. Department of Energy's 
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. 
The MSP Theft Campaign 
7. 
In order to conduct the MSP Theft Campaign, members of 
the APTl0 Group, including ZHU HUA, a/k/a "Afwar," a/k/a "CVNX," 
a/k/a "Alayos," a/k/a "Godkiller," and ZHANG SHILONG, a/k/a 
"Baobeilong," a/k/a "Zhang Jianguo," a/k/a "Atreexp," the 
10 
defendants, generally engaged in the same stages of activity 
involved in the Technology Theft Campaign as set forth above in 
paragraph 4. 
In addition, the APTl0 Group engaged in the 
foliowing conduct related to the MSP Theft Campaign: 
a. 
After the APTl0 Group had gained unauthorized 
access into the computers of an MSP, the APTl0 Group installed 
multiple different customized variants of malware commonly known 
as PlugX, RedLeaves, and QuasarRAT on MSP computers located 
around the world. 
The malware was installed using malicious 
files that masqueraded as legitimate files used by a victim 
computer's operating system in order to mask the APTl0 Group's 
actions as legitimate and thereby avoid antivirus detection. 
Such malware enabled members of the APTl0 Group to monitor 
victims' computers remotely and steal user credentials using 
various credential theft tools. 
The malware was also pre­
programmed to automatically communicate with domains hosted by 
DNS service providers that were assigned IP addresses of 
computers under the control of the ·APTl0 Group. 
In total, the 
APTl0 Group registered approximately 1,300 unique malicious 
domains in connection with the MSP Theft Campaign, some of which 
were registered using accounts opened as early as in or about 
2010. 
b. 
Once the APTl0 Group had stolen administrative 
credentials from computers of an MSP, it used those stolen 
credentials to initiate Remote Desktop Protocol ("RDPu) 
connections to other systems within an MSP and its clients' 
networks. 
This mode of operation enabled the APTl0 Group to 
move laterally through the interconnected networks of an MSP and 
its clients' networks and to compromise an MSP and its clients' 
computers on which no malware had been previously installed. 
c. 
Finally, after data of interest was identified on 
a compromised computer and packaged for exfiltration using 
encrypted archives, the APTl0 Group often used stolen 
credentials to move .the data of an MSP client to one or more 
other compromised computers of the MSP or its other clients' 
networks before the final exfiltration of the data to IP 
addresses under the control of the APTl0 Group. The APTl0 Group 
usually deleted the stolen files from compromised computers, 
thereby seeking to avoid detection and preventing identification 
of the specific files that were stolen. 
8. 
Throughout the conspiracy period, after the U.S. 
Government or certain private sector firms issued various public 
reports identifying APTl0 Group malware or domains as malicious, 
the APTl0 Group modified or abandoned such hacking 
12 
infrastructure. 
For example, in or about February 2007 during 
the Technology Theft Campaign, InfraGard, a non-profit 
organization serving as a public-private partnership between 
U.S. businesses and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, issued 
a public report identifying the malicious domains used by the 
APTl0 Group. 
Shortly after the Infragard report's release, the 
APTl0 Group stopped using the malicious domains identified in 
the report. 
Similarly, in or about April 2017 during the MSP 
Theft Campaign, a private cyber security firm issued a public 
report identifying the malicious domains used by the APTl0 
Group. 
Shortly after the report was issued, the APTl0 Group 
began using new variants of malware and new domains to commit 
intrusions, which would be less likely to be detected by victim 
companies and antivirus software. 
9. 
Over the course of the MSP Theft Campaign, members of 
the APTlO Group, including ZHU HUA, a/k/a "Afwar," a/k/a "CVNX," 
a/k/a "Alayos," a/k/a "Godkiller," and ZHANG SHILONG, a/k/a 
"Baobeilong," a/k/a "Zhang Jianguo," a/k/a "Atreexp," the 
defendants, successfully obtained unauthorized access to 
computers providing services to or belonging to victim companies 
located in at least 12 countries, including from at least the 
following victims: 
13 
a. 
a global financial institution; 
b. 
three telecommunications and/or consumer 
electronics companies; 
c. 
three companies involved in commercial or 
industrial manufacturing; 
d. 
two consulting companies; 
e. 
a healthcare company; 
f. 
a biotechnology company; 
g. 
a mining company; 
h. 
an automotive supplier company; and 
i. 
a drilling company. 
10. 
Finally, the APTl0 Group also compromised more than 40 
computers in order to steal sensitive data belonging to the 
Navy, including the names, Social Security numbers, dates of 
birth, salary information, personal phone numbers, and email 
addresses of more than 100,000 Navy personnel.
