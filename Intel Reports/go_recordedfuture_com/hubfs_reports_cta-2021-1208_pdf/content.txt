This report profiles trends in Chinese state-sponsored cyber 
espionage activity targeting Southeast Asian countries. The activity was 
identified through large-scale automated network traffic analytics and 
expert analysis. Data sources include the Recorded Future Platform, 
SecurityTrails, DomainTools, PolySwarm, Farsight, Team Cymru, and 
common open-source tools and techniques. The research will be of most 
interest to individuals engaged in strategic and operational intelligence 
relating to the activities of Chinese military and foreign intelligence 
agencies in cyberspace and network defenders with a presence in 
Southeast Asia.
Executive Summary
Recorded Future’s Insikt Group tracks Chinese 
state-sponsored cyber espionage operations targeting 
government and private sector organizations across 
Southeast Asia. In this report, we highlight multiple 
examples of activity reported to Recorded Future clients 
throughout 2021. The identified intrusion campaigns 
almost certainly support key strategic aims of the 
Chinese government, such as gathering intelligence 
on countries engaged in South China Sea territorial 
disputes or related to projects and countries strategically 
important to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). 
The activity highlighted includes a group we 
track as Threat Activity Group 16 (TAG-161), which 
has compromised several high-profile military and 
government organizations across Southeast Asia 
throughout 2021 using custom malware families such 
as FunnyDream and Chinoxy. Many of the governments 
targeted by TAG-16 are engaged in ongoing disputes 
with China over territorial claims in the South China Sea. 
Additionally, we highlight 2 separate suspected Chinese 
state-sponsored intrusion campaigns targeting entities 
in Laos and Cambodia. Both are likely intended to support 
BRI objectives. Victims in these 2 respective campaigns 
include the National Committee for Special Economic 
Zones (SEZs) and National Enterprise Database (NED) 
in Laos and Cambodia’s Sihanoukville Autonomous Port 
(PAS). 
1  Insikt Group publicly names a new threat activity group or campaign, 
such as RedFoxtrot, typically when analysts have data corresponding 
to at least 3 points on the Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis with 
at least medium confidence. We will occasionally report on significant 
activity using a temporary activity clustering name such as TAG-16, 
where the activity is new and significant but doesn’t map to existing 
groupings and hasn’t yet graduated or merged into an established 
activity group.
Key Judgments
•	 Our research highlights China’s continued 
strategic and tactical interest in government 
and private sector organizations in Southeast 
Asia. This targeting is almost certainly linked 
to a range of objectives intended to support 
a deepening of regional influence, including 
traditional intelligence gathering against regional 
rivals and allies, economic intelligence gathering 
against BRI-linked targets, and the South China 
Sea disputes.
•	 The operational tasking of TAG-16 is likely 
linked, in part, to gathering intelligence on 
South China Sea-related issues. Notably, Insikt 
Group identified the compromise of navies, 
prime minister’s offices, ministries of defense, 
and ministries of foreign affairs across several 
countries with a presence in the South China 
Sea.
•	 The targeting of Cambodia’s Sihanoukville 
Autonomous Port and Laos’s National Committee 
for SEZs is likely linked to China’s wider strategic 
objectives under the BRI. PAS has high strategic 
significance given its location along the Maritime 
Silk Road route, while the Lao government has 
promoted the development of SEZs as an entry 
point for private sector development, including 
domestic and foreign direct investment (FDI).

Background
Insikt Group has reported extensively on Chinese state-
sponsored threat activity groups targeting countries surrounding 
the People’s Republic of China (PRC). In the past year, much of 
this activity has focused on India, with groups such as RedEcho, 
RedFoxtrot, and TAG-28 heavily targeting government and 
private sector organizations following a significant increase in 
tensions between the Indian and PRC governments. Alongside 
this concentration on India, other Asian countries are also prime 
targets of many PRC-sponsored groups. Much of this is likely 
driven by traditional espionage goals, as well as supporting 
strategic policy objectives like the Belt and Road Initiative and 
Five-Year Plans. Southeast Asia is no exception to this, and 
the South China Sea territorial disputes very likely constitute 
another driver of China’s cyber espionage activity. 
Based on Recorded Future adversary infrastructure 
detection and Network Traffic Analysis (NTA) techniques, in the 
past 9 months, Insikt Group identified over 400 unique victim 
servers located in Southeast Asia communicating with malware 
command and control (C2) infrastructure with likely links to 
Chinese state-sponsored actors. The top 3 targeted countries 
within our data set were Malaysia, Indonesia, and Vietnam, with 
known groups active in the region including RedDelta, Naikon, 
and Goblin Panda, as well as temporary clusters we group as 
TAG-16 and TAG-22.

China State-Sponsored Activity in the South 
China Sea
Chinese state-sponsored groups have traditionally been 
highly active in targeting the PRC’s rival claimants in the South 
China Sea, with the operational tempo often mirroring increased 
geopolitical tensions. For instance, escalating tensions related to 
China’s development of artificial islands containing port facilities, 
airstrips, and military buildings within the disputed Spratly 
Islands archipelago reportedly led to increased activity from 
Chinese state-affiliated groups in 2015. This activity entailed 
reconnaissance and phishing campaigns targeting rival claimants 
throughout the development of the artificial islands, which 
intensified as the PRC’s progress was increasingly reported in 
local media throughout the region. Multiple Chinese APT groups 
were observed conducting this activity, including Vixen Panda, 
Naikon, and Goblin Panda (Cycldek).
In more recent years, Insikt Group has observed continued 
targeting of South China Sea claimants by additional Chinese 
state-sponsored groups, notably APT40, a group linked to the 
Ministry of State Security’s Hainan State Security Department. 
APT40 has typically targeted maritime and engineering entities, 
as well as organizations with operations in Southeast Asia or 
involved in South China Sea disputes. Of particular note was 
the group’s targeting of multiple Cambodian entities related 
to the country’s electoral system ahead of the country’s 2018 
election. Given the historical support of Cambodia’s incumbent 
government for China in the South China Sea, this has been 
interpreted as a possible step to monitor and avoid an election 
upset that could weaken China’s influence in the region.
Activity Spotlight: TAG-16 Targets Southeast Asian 
Governments with South China Sea Focus
Throughout 2021, Insikt Group tracked a persistent cyber 
espionage campaign targeting the prime minister’s offices, 
military entities, and government departments of rival South 
China Sea claimants Vietnam, Malaysia, and the Philippines, 
as listed in Table 1. Additional victims during the same period 
include organizations in Indonesia and Thailand. We attribute 
this activity to a Chinese state-sponsored group that we track as 
Threat Activity Group 16 (TAG-16). We also identified evidence 
suggesting that TAG-16 shares custom capabilities with the 
People’s Liberation Army (PLA)-linked activity group RedFoxtrot.
In November 2020, Bitdefender reported on a TAG-16 
campaign targeting Southeast Asian government institutions 
using the Chinoxy, FunnyDream, and PCShare backdoors. While 
the group behind this activity was unnamed, Kaspersky and PWC 
have also briefly referenced this FunnyDream campaign, with 
PWC tracking the group as Red Hariasa. In April 2021, we reported 
on multiple government organizations across Vietnam, Malaysia, 
Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines communicating with 
TAG-16 C2 infrastructure. In more recent activity, we identified 
a swath of additional high-value victims following this same 
targeting pattern within Southeast Asia and continued intrusions 
targeting organizations identified as victims within our previous 
research. Victim organizations include the following:
Figure 2: Suspected Chinese state-sponsored intrusions targeting Southeast Asia by country in the past 9 months. The number of victim organizations is likely smaller than the number of 
victim IPs listed due to IP reassignment and other technical considerations. (Source: Recorded Future)

We identified multiple FunnyDream backdoor samples 
configured to communicate with the group’s C2 infrastructure. 
These samples closely resemble FunnyDream samples previously 
reported by Bitdefender and NTT Security. Other researchers 
have noted a possible link between TAG-16 and the SManager 
backdoor (also known as PhantomNet). 
Specifically, an SManager sample referenced in NTT 
Security reporting (SHA256: 00badf016953ec740b61f4ba27c
5886a6460f6abba98819e00bde51574e0ebf4), was identified 
containing appended FunnyDream code and artifacts, such as the 
hardcoded TAG-16 C2 domain lotus.wmiprvse[.]com, PDB path 
overlap, and “funnydream” and “prettygirl” strings characteristic 
of older FunnyDream samples. However, the file name “igfx.exe.
bak” suggests this sample may have been tampered with, leaving 
an assessment on the group’s possible access to SManager 
inconclusive at this time.
Publicly reported activity related to SManager primarily 
describes campaigns targeting Vietnam, which also aligns to 
TAG-16 activity described in Insikt Group’s findings. Notably, 
ESET identified a supply chain compromise targeting the Vietnam 
Government Certification Authority (VGCA), where a digital 
signature toolkit installer located on the VGCA website was 
compromised to serve the SManager backdoor. However, despite 
TAG-16’s potential access to SManager, there is not sufficient 
evidence to link this supply chain compromise to this group at 
this time given the prevalence of tool sharing across disparate 
Chinese groups.
TAG-16 also shares a custom PCShare loader with the Chinese 
activity group RedFoxtrot, which Insikt Group linked to People’s 
Liberation Army (PLA) Unit 69010 in June 2021. Both groups 
have used the same loader to inject the open source PCShare 
backdoor into memory. Despite this, the group’s targeting and 
wider toolset are distinct, and this very likely further reflects the 
continued sharing of capabilities across Chinese threat activity 
groups. 
Belt and Road Initiative-Linked Targeting
Historically, many Chinese cyber espionage operations have 
heavily overlapped with projects and countries strategically 
important to the BRI. The BRI (also known as One Belt, One 
Road) is a global infrastructure development and connectivity 
project launched by China in 2013. Under the initiative, China 
assists countries seeking to improve their overland and maritime 
transportation networks, telecommunications systems, and 
energy infrastructure, among other types of projects, through 
financial assistance and other development activities. Although 
purely economic on the surface, the BRI almost certainly serves 
China’s geopolitical influence and military aims as well. Insikt 
Group has previously reported on China’s Digital Silk Road 
Initiative, the digital infrastructure component of the BRI, which 
we assess poses both a critical cybersecurity threat to the world 
and a growing threat to competitors’ markets.

Activity Spotlight: TAG-33 BRI-Linked Targeting in 
Laos
In May 2021, Insikt Group identified a cluster of ShadowPad, 
Cobalt Strike, and Trochilus infrastructure used in suspected 
Chinese state-sponsored network intrusion activity targeting 
telecommunications, government, and state-owned organizations 
within Laos. Of particular note, we identified the targeting of 
both the Lao National Committee for Special Economic Zones 
and the National Enterprise Database, which likely aligns with 
wider Chinese government economic and policy objectives under 
the BRI. We currently track this activity using the temporary 
group designator TAG-33. The Lao government has promoted 
the development of SEZs as an entry point for private sector 
development, including domestic and foreign direct investment 
(FDI). Notably, China has invested more than $1.5 billion in Laos’s 
SEZs, reportedly as part of the BRI, which Laos joined in 2018. 
Today, 4 of Laos’s 14 SEZs are operated by Chinese firms.
In addition to the multiple cases of overlapping victimology 
across this cluster, all of the identified C2 domains were 
registered through Namecheap, are Laos-themed, and many 
were registered on the same day. Across this series of intrusions, 
there were some historical overlaps with activity attributed to 
the Chinese state-sponsored group Goblin Panda (also known 
as Conimes and Cycldek). In addition to infrastructure overlap, 
the targeting of Laos and the use of Laos-themed domains is 
also in line with historical Goblin Panda activity. However, as 
the identified infrastructure overlaps were non-concurrent, we 
continue to track this TAG-33 activity as a distinct cluster.
TAG-33 Goblin Panda Overlaps
Insikt Group first identified the Trochilus C2 IP address 
139.99.6[.]155 hosting the domain laodata[.]network and 
its subdomain cdn.laodata[.]network on March 5, 2021. This 
domain has historical non-concurrent hosting overlaps with the 
suspected Goblin Panda domain viengchannews[.]com in 2019, 
through the New Zealand IP address 103.209.194[.]149. The 
subdomain cdn.viengchannews[.]com is linked to a RoyalRoad 
RTF sample which drops a NewCore RAT sample, both of which 
have previously been linked to Goblin Panda activity. The use 
of a .cdn subdomain and the popular registrar Namecheap is an 
additional link between these 2 indicators.
The Cobalt Strike and ShadowPad C2 89.38.225[.]140 
hosting the domain networkslaoupdate[.]com was also 
identified in relation to this activity due to shared victimology. 
Both networkslaoupdate[.]com and laodata[.]network were 
registered on the same day through Namecheap. This server was 
configured with the Cobalt Strike Amazon malleable C2 profile 
and used news.networkslaoupdate[.]com for C2. Similar to the 
laodata[.]network domain, this domain features historical non-
concurrent infrastructure overlap with a publicly reported Goblin 
Panda domain, laovoanew[.]com, with both domains hosted on 
the Singapore IP address 103.253.25[.]158 several months apart 
in 2019.

Activity Spotlight: TAG-34 Targeting of Cambodian 
Port Facility
In September 2021, Insikt Group identified intrusion activity 
linked to a suspected Chinese state-sponsored threat activity 
group targeting the Cambodian Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
(MOFA) and the country’s sole international and commercial 
deep seaport, Sihanoukville Autonomous Port. Using 
Recorded Future Network Traffic Analysis (NTA), we detected 
infrastructure linked to both of these entities communicating 
with a ShadowPad C2 cluster over a sustained period, which we 
currently track using the temporary group designator TAG-34. 
While we do not attribute this activity to a known threat activity 
group at this time, ShadowPad is a custom backdoor shared 
across multiple Chinese state-sponsored groups. 
While the targeting of Cambodia’s MOFA likely falls within the 
scope of traditional cyber espionage, the activity aimed at PAS is 
more likely linked to China’s objectives under the BRI. Although 
the port is government owned, it is largely financed by Japanese 
investment and is located near the China-owned Sihanoukville 
Special Economic Zone (SSEZ), a key location for China’s BRI-
linked projects within Cambodia. PAS also has high strategic 
significance given its location along the Maritime Silk Road route, 
along which Chinese companies have financed and built multiple 
deep sea ports under the banner of the BRI. China and Japan 
have historically vied for influence within Sihanoukville, with the 
targeting of the PAS potentially supporting an effort to offset 
Japanese influence within the province. 
From at least June until October 2021, infrastructure 
associated with these Cambodian organizations were identified 
communicating with the ShadowPad C2 cluster highlighted 
in Figure 5. As well as hosting overlaps, all of the identified 
domains were registered through GoDaddy and use 1984 Hosting 
nameservers. Originally considered unique to APT41 activity, in 
recent years ShadowPad use has drastically expanded across 
Chinese state-sponsored groups, with Insikt Group tracking at 
least 7 distinct activity groups using the malware family.

Outlook
Our research highlights China’s continued strategic and 
tactical interest in government and private sector organizations 
in Southeast Asia. This targeting likely serves several objectives, 
including traditional intelligence gathering against regional rivals 
and allies, economic intelligence gathering against BRI-linked 
targets, and the South China Sea disputes. Future activity 
targeting rival South China Sea claimants is likely to increase in 
line with geopolitical tensions. 
The scale and scope of China’s cyber espionage program 
remain unrivaled, exemplified by the large number of distinct 
actors with operational taskings within specific geographic 
regions. The countries surrounding China bear the brunt of this 
activity and are prime targets of many PLA Strategic Support 
Force (SSF) and Ministry of State Security (MSS)-linked threat 
activity groups.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS | CHINA
 Recorded Future’s research group, Insikt, tracks threat 
actors and their activity, focusing on state actors from China, 
Iran, Russia, and North Korea, as well as cybercriminals — 
individuals and groups — from Russia, CIS states, China, 
Iran, and Brazil. We emphasize tracking activity  groups and 
where possible, attributing them to nation state government, 
organizations, or affiliate institutions.
Our coverage includes:
•	
Government organizations and intelligence 
agencies, their associated laboratories, partners, 
industry collaborators, proxy entities, and 
individual threat actors
•	
Recorded Future-identified, suspected nation-
state activity groups, such as RedAlpha, 
RedBravo, Red Delta, and BlueAlpha and many 
other industry established groups
•	
Cybercriminal individuals and groups established 
and named by Recorded Future
•	
Newly emerging malware, as well as prolific, 
persistent commodity malware
Insikt Group publicly names a new threat activity group 
or campaign, such as RedFoxtrot, when analysts typically 
have data corresponding to at least three points on the 
Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis with at least medium 
confidence. We will occasionally report on significant activity 
using a temporary activity clustering name such as TAG-21 
where the activity is new and significant but doesn't map 
to existing groupings and hasn't yet graduated or merged 
into an established activity group. We tie this to a threat 
actor only when we can point to a handle, persona, person, 
or organization responsible. We will write about the activity 
as a campaign in the absence of this level of adversary 
data. We use the most widely used or recognized name for a 
particular group when the public body of empirical evidence 
is clear the activity corresponds to a known group.
Insikt Group uses a simple color and phonetic alphabet 
naming convention for new nation-state threat actor groups 
or campaigns. The color generally corresponds to that 
nation’s flag colors, with more color/nation pairings to be 
added as we identify and attribute new threat actor groups 
associated with new nations.
For newly identified cybercriminal groups, Insikt 
Group uses a naming convention corresponding to the 
Greek alphabet. Where we have identified a criminal entity 
connected to a particular country, we will use the appropriate 
country color, and where that group may be tied to a specific 
government organization, tie it to that entity specifically.
Insikt Group uses mathematical terms when naming 
newly identified malware.
