With an intimate knowledge of enterprise information technology, this threat group presents a significant risk even to organizations with well-developed legacy cyber defenses.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuddled Libra\\u2019s tactics can be fluid, adapting quickly to a target environment. They continue to use social engineering as their primary modus operandi, targeting a company's IT help support desk. For example, in under a few minutes, these threat actors successfully changed an account password and later reset the victim\\u2019s MFA to gain access to their networks.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuddled Libra was first noted for targeting organizations in the software automation, outsourcing and telecommunications verticals. Since then, they\\u2019ve expanded their targeting to include the technology, business process outsourcing, hospitality and more recently, financial industries. They show no signs of slowing.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnit 42 researchers and responders have investigated interrelated incidents from mid-2022 through the beginning of 2024, which we\\u2019ve attributed to the threat group Muddled Libra. Initial attacks were highly structured and favored large business process outsourcing firms serving high-value cryptocurrency holders. We believe that when the threat actors exhausted those targets, they evolved into a ransomware affiliate model with extortion as their key objective.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the cases we\\u2019ve been involved with, we observed Muddled Libra performing the following activities:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\tUsing NSOCKS and TrueSocks proxy services\\r\\n \\tCreating email rules to forward emails from specific security vendors to the actors to monitor communications and those helping in the investigation\\r\\n \\tDeploying a custom virtual machine into the environment\\r\\n \\tUsing an open-source rootkit, bedevil (bdvl) to target VMware vCenter servers\\r\\n \\tGaining administrative permissions\\r\\n \\tHeavy use of anonymizing proxy services\\r\\n\\r\\nWe also believe that members of Muddled Libra speak English as a first language, which provides them greater ability to conduct their social engineering attacks with other English speakers. Muddled Libra has also been observed using AI to spoof victims\\u2019 voices. Social media videos can be used by attackers to train AI models. The targets we\\u2019ve observed seem to be primarily in the U.S.\\r\\n\\r\\nThwarting Muddled Libra requires interweaving tight security controls, diligent awareness training and vigilant monitoring.\\r\\n\\r\\nPalo Alto Networks customers are better protected from the threats described in this article through a modern security architecture built around Cortex XSIAM in concert with Cortex XDR. The Advanced URL Filtering and DNS Security Cloud-Delivered Security Services can help protect against command and control (C2) infrastructure, while App-ID can limit anonymization services allowed to connect to the network.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRelated Unit 42 Topics\\r\\nMuddled Libra (related to Scattered Spider, Scatter Swine), 0ktapus, Social Engineering\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThreat Overview\\r\\nThe attack style defining Muddled Libra appeared on the cybersecurity radar in late 2022 with the release of the 0ktapus phishing kit. This malware kit offered the following features:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\tA prebuilt hosting framework\\r\\n \\tEasy C2 connectivity\\r\\n \\tBundled attack templates\\r\\n\\r\\nThese options allowed attackers to emulate mobile authentication pages cheaply and easily.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith over 200 realistic fake authentication portals and some targeted smishing, attackers quickly gathered credentials and multifactor authentication (MFA) codes for over one hundred organizations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe speed and breadth of these attacks caught many defenders off-guard. While smishing is not a new tactic, the 0ktapus framework commoditized what would typically require complex infrastructure and advanced technical skills, in a way that granted even low-skilled attackers a high attack success rate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sheer number of targets being hit with this kit created a fair amount of confusion regarding attribution in the research community. Previous reporting by Group-IB, CrowdStrike and Okta has documented and mapped many of these attacks to the following intrusion groups: 0ktapus, Scattered Spider and Scatter Swine.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile these have been frequently treated as several names for one group, what these names actually define are:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\tAn attack style using a common toolkit\\r\\n \\tA social forum-based collaboration network\\r\\n \\tAn Agile-like team structure\\r\\n\\r\\nMuddled Libra is a distinct group of actors using this tradecraft. In a 2023 blog posted on ALPHV\\u2019s leak site, the attackers corroborated this view, claiming that previous researcher attribution models have been non-specific.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring Unit 42 Incident Response investigations, we identified several cases we attribute to Muddled Libra. Muddled Libra has been responsible for a campaign of complex supply chain attacks, ultimately leading to high-value cryptocurrency targets.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis group has only intensified their campaign. They are shifting tactics to adapt to improving cyber defenses, and they are targeting to broaden their attack scope.\\r\\n\\r\\n[caption id=\\\"attachment_133068\\\" align=\\\"aligncenter\\\" width=\\\"600\\\"] Figure 1. Muddled Libra evolved tactics.[\\/caption]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnit 42 has observed an extensive toolkit used in these attacks. This arsenal ranges from hands-on social engineering and smishing attacks to proficiency with niche penetration testing, forensics tools and even legitimate systems management software. This breadth of tooling gives Muddled Libra an edge over even a robust and modern cyber defense plan.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn incidents the Unit 42 team has investigated, Muddled Libra has been methodical in pursuing its goals and highly flexible with attack strategies. When an attack tactic is blocked, they have either rapidly pivoted to another vector or modified the target environment to enable their favored path.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuddled Libra has also repeatedly demonstrated a strong understanding of the modern incident response (IR) framework. This knowledge allows them to continue progressing toward their goals even as incident responders attempt to expel them from an environment. Once established, this threat group is difficult to eradicate. Unit 42 has observed them joining IR war rooms and creating rules within email security platforms to intercept and redirect incident response-related communication.\\r\\n\\r\\nInitially, Muddled Libra preferred targeting a victim\\u2019s downstream customers using stolen data and, if allowed, would return repeatedly to the well to refresh their stolen dataset. Using this stolen data, the threat actor could return to prior victims even after the initial incident response.\\r\\n\\r\\nFurthermore, Muddled Libra appeared to have clear goals for its breaches versus just capitalizing on opportunistic access. They rapidly sought and stole information on downstream client environments and then used it to pivot into those environments.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a notable departure from earlier tactics, in 2023, intelligence indicated that Muddled Libra joined the ALPHV\\/Blackcat ransomware-as-a-service affiliate program. They wasted no time implementing this new tool set with a radical departure from previous tradecraft in favor of new attacks focused on data theft, encryption and enormous extortion demands.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe U.S. Justice Department interrupted ALPHV\\u2019s operations shortly after these attacks began. Since this action, new Muddled Libra attacks have shifted to data theft with a simple extortion objective. Muddled Libra has demonstrated a strong understanding of their victims\\u2019 \\u201cline of business\\u201d processes, and they strike at the heart of business operations.\\r\\nAttack Chain\\r\\nWhile each incident is unique, Unit 42 researchers have identified enough commonalities in tradecraft to attribute multiple incidents to Muddled Libra. Figure 1 shows the attack chain.\\r\\n\\r\\n[caption id=\\\"attachment_132977\\\" align=\\\"aligncenter\\\" width=\\\"700\\\"] Figure 2. Muddled Libra attack chain.[\\/caption]\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have mapped these to the MITRE ATT&amp;CK\\u00ae framework, summarized below.\\r\\nReconnaissance\\r\\nMuddled Libra has consistently demonstrated an intimate knowledge of targeted organizations, including employee lists, job roles and cellular phone numbers. In some instances, threat actors likely obtained this data during earlier breaches against upstream targets.\\r\\n\\r\\nThreat actors also frequently obtain information packs from illicit data brokers such as the now-defunct Genesis and Russian Markets. This data is typically harvested from corporate and personal infected devices using malware such as Raccoon Stealer and RedLine Stealer.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the early advent of bring-your-own-device (BYOD) policies and the popularity of hybrid work solutions, corporate data and credentials are frequently used and cached on personal devices. Decentralizing the management and protection of IT assets creates a lucrative targeting opportunity for information-stealing malware.\\r\\nResource Development\\r\\nLookalike domains used in smishing attacks are a consistent hallmark for Muddled Libra. This tactic is effective since mobile devices frequently truncate links in SMS messages. Malicious domain names frequently use the format of the organization name with a hyphen, followed by a service (like SSO, helpdesk or HR).\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly clusters of attacks attributed to the 0ktapus campaign consistently used domains registered via Porkbun or Namecheap and hosted on Digital Ocean infrastructure. These domains are short-lived, used only during the initial access phase, and they are quickly taken down before defenders can investigate. Recently, we\\u2019ve observed Muddled Libra adding Metaregistrar and Hosting Concepts to their preferred registrar list, and their hosting has moved behind a large content delivery network (CDN) service.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn many investigations, Unit 42 observed the use of the 0ktapus phishing kit for credential harvesting. Group-IB has done a great deep dive analysis of this versatile kit, which is widely available in the criminal underground. It requires little skill to stand up and configure, making it an ideal tool for highly targeted smishing attacks. Since its introduction, other threat groups have adopted this kit, and it continues to evolve.\\r\\nInitial Access\\r\\nIn all incidents where Unit 42 could determine an initial access vector, smishing and helpdesk social engineering were involved. In most early incidents, the threat actor sent a lure message directly to the targeted employees\\u2019 cellphones, claiming they needed to update account information or reauthenticate to a corporate application. Messages contained a link to a spoofed corporate domain designed to emulate a familiar login page.\\r\\n\\r\\nLikely due to organizations\\u2019 large-scale phase-out of SMS as a secondary authentication factor, Muddled Libra has begun to move away from smishing as an initial entry vector. New cases indicate that this group pervasively uses direct social engineering.\\r\\n\\r\\nHelpdesk and customer service agents are particularly high-value targets. Unit 42 has observed Muddled Libra using a combination of open-source intelligence and previously compromised sensitive data to get help desk agents to reset both passwords and MFA on the same call.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese attacks are convincing and persistent. They focus on wearing the agent\\u2019s defenses down, running up the call length and ultimately bypassing security restrictions that could have prevented these attacks.\\r\\nPersistence\\r\\nMuddled Libra was particularly focused on maintaining access to targeted environments. While threat actors commonly use a free or demo version of a remote monitoring and management (RMM) tool during intrusions, Muddled Libra often installed half a dozen or more of these utilities. They did this to ensure they would maintain a backdoor into the environment even if one were discovered.\\r\\n\\r\\nUsing commercial RMM tools is particularly problematic as these tools are legitimate, business-critical applications that Muddled Libra abuses. None of these tools are inherently malicious and they are frequently used in the day-to-day administration of many enterprise networks. Defenders should weigh the risks of an outright block versus carefully monitoring their use.\\r\\n\\r\\nObserved tools included Zoho Assist, AnyDesk, Splashtop, TeamViewer, ITarian, FleetDeck, ASG Remote Desktop, RustDesk and ManageEngine RMM. Unit 42 recommends organizations block by signer any RMM tools that they have not sanctioned for use within the enterprise.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuddled Libra has also demonstrated familiarity with cloud platforms, both hosted and software as a service (SaaS). They will use these platforms to establish a foothold within the organization, as these resources are unlikely to be monitored like traditional assets and systems. Unit 42 has a separate article with much more detail on cloud targeting.\\r\\n\\r\\nNotably, recent attacks indicate that long-term persistence is no longer this group\\u2019s primary objective. Instead, they\\u2019ve moved to a more traditional \\u201cencrypt and extort\\u201d model. Targeting has broadened to include large organizations more likely to have the capability to pay large ransoms. Once this group learns and understands the infrastructure and software used in an industry, they tend to target other organizations in the same vertical.\\r\\nDefense Evasion\\r\\nDemonstrating proficiency with many security controls, Muddled Libra evaded common defenses.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir tactics have included the following:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\tDisabling antivirus and host-based firewalls\\r\\n \\tAttempting to delete firewall profiles\\r\\n \\tCreating defender exclusions\\r\\n \\tDeactivating or uninstalling EDR and other monitoring products\\r\\n \\tStanding up unmanaged cloud virtual machines\\r\\n \\tElevating access in virtual desktop environments\\r\\n\\r\\nAttackers also re-enabled and used existing Active Directory accounts to avoid triggering common security information and event management (SIEM) monitoring rules. We also observed them operating within endpoint detection and response (EDR) administrative consoles to clear alerts. We cover this attack in detail in our article. \\r\\n\\r\\nMuddled Libra has been careful with operational security, consistently using commercial virtual private network (VPN) services to obscure their geographic location and attempt to blend in with legitimate traffic. The group preferred Mullvad VPNin early incidents Unit 42 researchers investigated, but we also observed multiple other vendors, such as ExpressVPN, NordVPN, Ultrasurf, Easy VPN and ZenMate.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnit 42 researchers have more recently observed the usage of rotating residential proxy services as well. As reported by Brian Krebs in 2021, residential proxy services typically hide their code inside browser extensions, allowing operators to lease out residential connections for legitimate and malicious use alike.\\r\\n\\r\\nDefenders should look for multiple users authenticating from new residential IPs over short periods.\\r\\nCredential Access\\r\\nOnce attackers captured the credentials they would use for initial access, the attacker took one of two paths. In one case, they continued with the authentication process from a machine they controlled and immediately requested a MFA code. In the other cases, they generated an endless string of MFA prompts until the user accepted one out of fatigue or frustration (aka MFA bombing).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn cases where MFA bombing was unsuccessful, the threat actor contacted the organization\\u2019s help desk, claiming to be the victim. They would then state that their phone was inoperable or misplaced and would request to enroll a new, attacker-controlled MFA authentication device.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuddled Libra\\u2019s social engineering success is notable. Across many cases, the group demonstrated unusually high comfort in engaging the help desk and other employees over the phone, convincing them to engage in unsafe actions.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf targeted accounts do not have the desired access, Muddled Libra will use the account for discovery and repeat the process until they have the access necessary for their attack.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter establishing a foothold, Muddled Libra moves quickly to elevate access. Standard credential-stealing tools employed in this phase included Mimikatz, ProcDump, DCSync, Raccoon Stealer and LAPS Toolkit. When the group could not quickly locate elevated credentials, they turned to Impacket, MIT Kerberos Ticket Manager and NTLM Encoder\\/Decoder.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn some incidents, Muddled Libra employed specialized tools to search memory contents for credentials directly using MAGNET RAM Capture and Volatility. As these are legitimate forensics tools that Muddled Libra is abusing, defenders should carefully consider the downsides to blocking them, including the possibility of security team activity generating false positive alerts.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis tactic raises an important flag for defenders. Even though user accounts might be protected through privileged access management, endpoints often have elevated credentials cached for system management or to run services. Care should be taken to ensure that privileged credentials only have the permissions necessary to perform their intended functions and are closely monitored for deviations from normal behavior.\\r\\nDiscovery\\r\\nMuddled Libra\\u2019s discovery methods were consistent from case to case. In our investigations, the group used well-known, legitimate penetration testing tools to map the environment and identify targets of interest. Their toolkit included SharpHound, ADRecon, AD Explorer, Angry IP Scanner, Angry Port Scanner and CIMplant.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuddled Libra also proved proficient with commercial systems administration tools such as ManageEngine, LANDESK and PDQ Inventory for discovery and automation. They also used VMware PowerCLI and RVTools in virtual environments.\\r\\n\\r\\nDefenders should be vigilant in identifying unsanctioned network scanning and unusual rapid access to multiple systems or access that crosses logical business segments.\\r\\nExecution\\r\\nIn early incidents, Muddled Libra appeared primarily interested in data and credential theft, and we infrequently saw remote execution. However, more recent cases included a BlackCat ransomware component. When needed, the group accomplishes execution with Sysinternals PsExec or Impacket. We also observed Muddled Libra using the victim\\u2019s system management tools to execute malicious code. They used captured credentials or authentication hashes for privilege elevation.\\r\\nLateral Movement\\r\\nMuddled Libra preferred using remote desktop protocol (RDP) connections from compromised computers for lateral movement inside the target environment. This approach helps to minimize discoverable external network artifacts in logs that could alert defenders and help investigators with attribution.\\r\\nCollection\\r\\nMuddled Libra is familiar with typical enterprise data management. They\\u2019ve successfully located sensitive organizational data in a wide range of common data repositories, both structured and unstructured, including the following:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\tConfluence\\r\\n \\tCode Management Platforms\\r\\n \\tElastic\\r\\n \\tMicrosoft Office 365 suite (e.g., SharePoint, Outlook)\\r\\n \\tInternal messaging platforms\\r\\n\\r\\nThey also targeted data in the victim\\u2019s environment from typical service desk applications like Zendesk and Jira. Mined data included credentials for further compromise and they directly targeted sensitive and confidential information.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnit 42 researchers observed Muddled Libra using the open-source data mining tool Snaffler and native tools to search registries, local drives and network shares for keywords like *password*, and securestring. Threat actors then staged compromised data and archived it for exfiltration using WinRAR or PeaZip. They used stolen sensitive data as leverage in extortion demands.\\r\\n\\r\\nDefenders should regularly perform keyword searches in their environments to identify improperly stored data and credentials as part of a broader data management and classification strategy.\\r\\nExfiltration\\r\\nIn several cases, Muddled Libra attempted to establish reverse proxy shells or secure shell (SSH) tunnels for command and control exfiltration. We observed them using tunneling software such as RSocx. Muddled Libra also used common file transfer sites such as put[.]io, transfer[.]sh, wasabi[.]com, or gofile[.]io to both exfiltrate data and pull down attack tools. We also observed the use of Cyberduck as a file transfer agent.\\r\\n\\r\\nThreat actors often abuse, take advantage of or subvert legitimate products such as Cyberduck for malicious purposes. This does not necessarily imply a flaw or malicious quality to the legitimate product being abused.\\r\\nImpact\\r\\nThe early impact directly observed by Unit 42 was some combination of the theft of sensitive data and Muddled Libra leveraging trusted organizational infrastructure for follow-on attacks on downstream customers.\\r\\n\\r\\nLater attacks were much more destructive, and they included the following activities:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\tDisruption of operations\\r\\n \\tDamage to sensitive systems\\r\\n \\tEncryption of critical data\\r\\n \\tEnormous extortion demands\\r\\n\\r\\nConclusion and Mitigations\\r\\nMuddled Libra is a methodical adversary that substantially threatens enterprise organizations across many industries. They are proficient in a range of security disciplines, able to thrive in relatively secure environments and execute rapidly to complete devastating attack chains.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuddled Libra doesn\\u2019t bring anything new to the table except for the uncanny knack of stringing together weaknesses to disastrous effect. Defenders must combine cutting-edge technology, comprehensive security hygiene and external threats and internal events monitoring. The high-stakes risk of operational disruption and loss of sensitive data is a strong incentive for modernizing information security programs.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the mitigation recommendations included in the Attack Chain subsections above, we recommend organizations:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\tImplement MFA and single sign-on (SSO) wherever possible \\u2013 preferably Fast Identity Online (FIDO). In the cases we investigated, Muddled Libra was most successful when they convinced employees to help them bypass MFA. When they could not quickly establish a foothold, they appeared to move on to other targets.\\r\\n \\tDefenders should consider implementing security alerting and account lockout on repeated MFA failures.\\r\\n \\tImplement comprehensive user awareness training. Muddled Libra is heavily focused on social engineering help desk and other employees via phone and SMS. Employee training on identifying suspicious non-email-based outreach is critical.\\r\\n \\tIn case of a breach, assume this threat actor knows the modern IR playbook. Consider setting up out-of-band response mechanisms.\\r\\n \\tEnsure credential hygiene is up to date. Only grant access when and for as long as necessary.\\r\\n \\tMonitoring and managing access to critical defenses and controls is essential to defending against skilled attackers. Rights should be restricted to only what is necessary for each job function. Identity threat detection and response (ITDR) tools such as Cortex XDR and Cortex XSIAM should be used to monitor for abnormal behavior.\\r\\n \\tDefenders should limit anonymization services allowed to connect to the network, ideally at the firewall by App-ID.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo defend against the threats described in this blog, Palo Alto Networks further recommends that organizations employ the following capabilities:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\tNetwork security: delivered through a Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW) configured with machine learning enabled and best-in-class, cloud-delivered security services. This includes, for example, threat prevention, URL filtering, DNS security and a malware prevention engine capable of identifying and blocking malicious samples and infrastructure.\\r\\n \\tEndpoint security: delivered through an XDR solution that can identify malicious code through advanced machine learning and behavioral analytics. This solution should be configured to act on and block threats in real-time as they are identified.\\r\\n \\tSecurity automation: delivered through an XSOAR or XSIAM solution capable of providing SOC analysts with a comprehensive understanding of the threat derived by stitching together data from endpoints, network, cloud and identity systems.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you think you might have been compromised or have an urgent matter, get in touch with the Unit 42 Incident Response team or call:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\tNorth America Toll-Free: 866.486.4842 (866.4.UNIT42)\\r\\n \\tEMEA: +31.20.299.3130\\r\\n \\tAPAC: +65.6983.8730\\r\\n \\tJapan: +81.50.1790.0200\\r\\n\\r\\nIndicators of Compromise\\r\\nIPs observed during this activity:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\t104.247.82[.]11\\r\\n \\t105.101.56[.]49\\r\\n \\t105.158.12[.]236\\r\\n \\t134.209.48[.]68\\r\\n \\t137.220.61[.]53\\r\\n \\t138.68.27[.]0\\r\\n \\t146.190.44[.]66\\r\\n \\t149.28.125[.]96\\r\\n \\t157.245.4[.]113\\r\\n \\t159.223.208[.]47\\r\\n \\t159.223.238[.]0\\r\\n \\t162.19.135[.]215\\r\\n \\t164.92.234[.]104\\r\\n \\t165.22.201[.]77\\r\\n \\t167.99.221[.]10\\r\\n \\t172.96.11[.]245\\r\\n \\t185.56.80[.]28\\r\\n \\t188.166.92[.]55\\r\\n \\t193.149.129[.]177\\r\\n \\t207.148.0[.]54\\r\\n \\t213.226.123[.]104\\r\\n \\t35.175.153[.]217\\r\\n \\t45.156.85[.]140\\r\\n \\t45.32.221[.]250\\r\\n \\t64.227.30[.]114\\r\\n \\t79.137.196[.]160\\r\\n \\t92.99.114[.]231\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditional Resources\\r\\n\\r\\n \\tMuddled Libra Discussion With Unit 42 Senior Consultant Stephanie Regan \\u2013 Threat Vector Podcast, Unit 42 on CyberWire Daily\\r\\n \\tExposing Muddled Libra's Meticulous Tactics With Unit 42 Senior Researcher Kristopher Russo \\u2013 Threat Vector Podcast, Unit 42 on CyberWire Daily\\r\\n \\tMuddled Libra's Evolution to the Cloud \\u2013 Unit 42, Palo Alto Networks\\r\\n \\tRoasting 0ktapus: The phishing campaign going after Okta identity credentials \\u2013\\u00a0Group-IB\\r\\n \\tNot a SIMulation: CrowdStrike Investigations Reveal Intrusion Campaign Targeting Telco and BPO Companies \\u2013 CrowdStrike\\r\\n \\tDetecting Scatter Swine: Insights into a Relentless Phishing Campaign \\u2013 Okta\\r\\n \\tI Solemnly Swear My Driver Is Up to No Good: Hunting for Attestation Signed Malware \\u2013 Mandiant\\r\\n \\tIs Your Browser Extension a Botnet Backdoor? \\u2013 Krebs on Security\\r\\n \\tSuspicion stalks Genesis Market\\u2019s competitors following FBI takedown \\u2013 The Record, Recorded Future News\\r\\n\\r\\nUpdated March 19, 2024, at 6:52 a.m. PT to correct Figure 1.\\u00a0\",\"publisher\":{\"@type\":\"Organization\",\"@id\":\"#panworg\"},\"image\":{\"@type\":\"ImageObject\",\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/unit42.paloaltonetworks.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2024\\/06\\/01_Ransomware_Category_1920x900-300x300.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":300},\"speakable\":{\"@type\":\"SpeakableSpecification\",\"xPath\":[\"\\/html\\/head\\/title\",\"\\/html\\/head\\/meta[@name='description']\\/@content\"]},\"author\":[{\"@type\":\"Person\",\"name\":\"Kristopher Russo\"},{\"@type\":\"Person\",\"name\":\"Austin Dever\"},{\"@type\":\"Person\",\"name\":\"Amer Elsad\"}]}</script><link rel='stylesheet' id='crayon-css' href='https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/plugins/crayon-syntax-highlighter/css/min/crayon.min.css?ver=_2.7.2_beta' media='all' />",
