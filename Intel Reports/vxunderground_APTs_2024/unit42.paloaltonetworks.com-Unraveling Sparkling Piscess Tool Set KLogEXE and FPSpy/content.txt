Unraveling Sparkling Pisces’s Tool Set: KLogEXE and FPSpy
Daniel Frank, Lior Rochberger ⋮ ⋮ 9/26/2024
Executive Summary
Unit 42 researchers discovered two malware samples used by the Sparkling Pisces (aka Kimsuky) threat group. This
includes an undocumented keylogger, called KLogEXE by its authors, and an undocumented variant of a backdoor
dubbed FPSpy. These samples enhance Sparkling Pisces' already extensive arsenal and demonstrate the group’s
continuous evolution and increasing capabilities.
Based on our analysis, we suspect that the FPSpy variant detailed in this report is a variant of malware mentioned in
a campaign carried out in 2022. That campaign targeted users of a South Korean technology conglomerate.
In this article, we will provide a technical analysis of KLogEXE and FPSpy, and we’ll shed some light on Sparkling
Pisces’s infrastructure. By understanding the mechanics of those two pieces of malware and the methods employed
by Sparkling Pisces, organizations can better prepare and defend against such threats.
Palo Alto Networks customers receive better protection from the threats discussed in this article through Cortex XDR
and XSIAM.
Customers are also better protected through Cloud-Delivered Security Services for the Next-Generation Firewall,
including Advanced WildFire, Advanced URL Filtering, Advanced DNS Security and Advanced Threat Prevention.

Background: Who Is Sparkling Pisces?
The North Korean APT group Sparkling Pisces (aka Kimsuky, THALLIUM, Velvet Chollima) is known for its
sophisticated cyberespionage operations and advanced spear phishing attacks. The group’s most notable attack was
against Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power (KHNP) in 2014.
The group initially targeted South Korean government agencies, research institutions and think tanks. As it evolved, it
expanded its reach to Western countries, including the United States, highlighting the group’s status as a global
threat.
Nicknamed “the king of spear phishing,” the group has conducted hundreds of attacks to lure victims into
downloading and executing malicious payloads. Recently, the group targeted South Koreans by masquerading as a
legitimate Korean company and using a valid certificate to sign malware. Sparkling Pisces is also known for its
complex and constantly evolving infrastructure, which overlaps between multiple malware strains and campaigns.
Infrastructure Pivoting: Discovering New Malware Links
While tracking Sparkling Pisces’s infrastructure, we found connections between different operations and tools. We
also discovered the group using new and undocumented malware.
One of the malware samples, KLogEXE, was found by tracking the infrastructure that the group used as the
command and control (C2) of a PowerShell keylogger that the JPCERT documented. The threat actor delivered the
PowerShell keylogger, which an earlier report by ASEC also mentioned, in a spear phishing campaign targeting
South Korean users.
The PowerShell keylogger from the aforementioned JPCERT report communicates with www.vic.apollo-star7[.]kro.kr,
which resolves to 152.32.138[.]167.
Pivoting on that IP address led us to another file, a Portable Executable (PE) called powershell.exe
(a173a425d17b6f2362eca3c8ea4de9860b52faba414bbb22162895641dda0dc2).
When examining the file, we found that it communicates to a different domain that resolves to the same IP address as
the PowerShell keylogger. It also uses an unknown Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) pattern that we didn't observe
in any other malware associated with Sparkling Pisces.
The Maltego graph in Figure 1 below shows the overlaps between the PowerShell malware and the two examples of
PE malware we discovered called KLogEXE and FPSpy. This includes similar domains registered by the same
registrant email.

KLogExe Analysis
The first PE malware we discovered (powershell.exe) is a keylogger named KLogExe. Based on the dialog resource,
the internal name is KLogExe, and it appears to be a similar implementation of the aforementioned PowerShell
keylogger, but written in C++.
Figure 2. Dialog resource of KLogExe.
KLogExe collects the following data from the compromised machine:
Applications currently running on the compromised host
Keyboard keylogging using the GetAsyncKeyState method
Mouse clicks, including retrieving the button name
KLogExe saves the collected data in an .ini file, under C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\desktops.ini. When
it reaches its file size limit, KLogExe adds the date to the name of the file, generates a random boundary, and sends it
over HTTP to the C2 using the following URI: /wp-content/include.php?_sys_=7.

FPSpy Analysis
The second piece of PE malware we uncovered is FPSpy, a threat that has remained relatively under the radar since
at least 2022. Based on code and behavioral similarities, this malware appears to be a variant of the malware
described in ASEC’s research from 2022. Several characteristics, including the naming conventions of additional
downloaded modules and logs, as well as the malware’s capabilities, also closely resemble Sparkling Pisces’s
KGHSpy backdoor discovered in 2020.
Similar to KGHSpy, we suspect that there is the possibility that FPSpy binaries are timestomped. This means that
threat authors modified the compilation time to hide the real creation time of the malware.
FPSpy was first uploaded to VirusTotal on June 26, 2024, although its compilation timestamp dates back to 2018.
Moreover, we discovered that the hard-coded subdomain for the malware's C2 server
bitjoker2024.000webhostapp[.]com, was first seen in 2024.
Unlike KLogExe, FPSpy is a DLL named sys.dll with a unique export called MazeFunc. The DLL is contained in a
resource called DB in its custom loader, whose purpose is to drop sys.dll to the
C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WPSOffice\ folder and load it. Figure 4 below shows the loader’s code.
Figure 4. The code from the sys.dll loader is in charge of loading sys.dll.
FPSpy implements a range of additional capabilities beyond keylogging. Some of these capabilities include:
Storing configuration data about the infected device in a separate file called Param.ini
Storing a vast amount of system information in a file with the naming format Sysinfo_<date>_.txt
Downloading and executing additional encrypted modules
Working in a multithreading model, with a thread in charge of downloading additional modules, and one in
charge of uploading data to the C2
Executing arbitrary commands
Executing the PowerShell tree command to enumerate drives, folders and files on the infected device, which
the malware stores in a file named Drv_<drive letter>
Figure 5 below shows the aforementioned files, which are also stored under the
C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WPSOffice\ folder.

The Connection Between KLogExe and FPSpy
Our analysis indicates that FPSpy shares its codebase with KLogExe, suggesting a possible connection between the
two. For example, Figure 6 shows its dialog resource.

We were able to find code similarities in the implementations of both malware. These similarities include:
Using the same HackingTeam’s leaked code for dynamic API calls to harden static detection
Similar hard-coded HTTP packet structure, including similar headers, a randomly generated boundary string
and a Chrome version Chrome/31.0.1650.57 used for the User-Agent that is over a decade old
Storing the malware’s data (such as keylogging data) in an .ini file with similar content
Figure 7 below depicts the section in the code that is in charge of the beginning of the keylogging process. This
section also builds the HTTP packet for data exfiltration of KLogExe and FPSpy respectively.

Conclusion
Our research highlights the continuous evolution and sophistication of Sparkling Pisces's tool set, and their constantly
evolving infrastructure. We uncovered another piece of Sparkling Pisces’s infrastructure, and two additional threats in
their tool set. This included an undocumented type of malware, KLogExe, and a previously undocumented variant of
malware called FPSpy.
Through examining KLogExe, we revealed its keylogging and data exfiltration mechanisms. Our investigation of
FPSpy uncovered its advanced functionalities, including data collection and arbitrary command execution.
By identifying the connections between KLogExe and FPSpy, we demonstrated the shared codebase and
methodologies employed by Sparkling Pisces.
Most of the targets we observed during our research originated from South Korea and Japan, which is congruent with
previous Kimsuky targeting.
