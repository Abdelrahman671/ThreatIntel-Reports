DPRK state-linked cyber actors conduct software 
supply chain attacks  
 
Overview 
The National Intelligence Service (NIS) of the Republic of Korea (ROK) and the National 
Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) of the United Kingdom (UK) have identified Democratic 
People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) state-linked cyber actors targeting software supply 
chain products, widely used by government organisations, financial institutions and 
defence industry companies globally.  
The NIS and the NCSC are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) to help 
prevent compromise and raise public awareness. It includes DPRK state-linked cyber 
actors’ tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) used in their global supply chain 
attacks, as well as preventative measures to help avoid such attacks.  
Further Details 
In recent years, supply chain attacks from DPRK state-linked cyber actors have steadily 
increased in volume and have become more sophisticated. The malicious actors utilise 
tactics including zero-day attacks and multiple exploits to attack software supply chain 
products, used by a number of international organisations.

The NIS and the NCSC consider these supply chain attacks to align and considerably 
assist with the fulfilment of wider DPRK state priorities. This includes revenue 
generation and espionage, with the theft of advanced technologies across a range of 
sectors, including but not limited to defence.  
Supply chain attacks are a highly effective means of compromising numerous well-
protected, high-profile targets. Several elements of the supply chain have proved 
susceptible to compromise, including software vendors, managed service providers 
and cloud providers. From here, an actor can indiscriminately target a number of 
organisations and users, and their attacks can be expanded or shifted to a 
ransomware attack to demand money or cause a system disruption. 
It can be hard to detect these attacks as the actors are using legitimate software and 
hardware. 
With the level of the threat likely to increase, organisations should establish and put 
in place relevant security measures to safely manage the security of the products and 
to build resilience to attacks.  
 
Technical Details 
For software supply chain attacks, DPRK state-linked cyber actors have used zero-day 
exploits and newly published vulnerabilities and tools, as well as exploited multiple 
vulnerabilities in series, to precisely attack a specific target. 
Below are recent supply chain attacks conducted by DPRK-based actors, detailing their 
attack flow and modi operandi.

Attacks on various supply chain products, using zero-day vulnerabilities: 
In March 2023, cyber actors used the software vulnerabilities of security 
authentication and network-linked systems in series to gain unauthorised access to 
the intranet of a target organisation. It used a software vulnerability of the 
MagicLine4NX security authentication program for the initial intrusion into an 
internet-connected computer of the target, and exploited a zero-day vulnerability of 
the network-linked system to move laterally and gain unauthorised access to 
information.  
The attack flow below shows the procedure of serial complex attacks on two supply 
chain products: 
Attack Flow: 
1. The cyber actors compromised the website of a media outlet, deployed malicious 
scripts into an article and created a watering hole. The malicious scripts were 
implemented to work when certain IP ranges were connected. 
2. When victims opened the infected article from an internet-connected computer, 
 
 
4 
 
 
 
which was installed with the vulnerable security authentication software, the  
vulnerable software executed the malicious code. The victim computer then 
connected to the command and control (C2), and the attackers used the C2 to 
achieve remote control over the infected computer. 
3. The actors were able to access an internet-side server from an internet-connected 
PC without permission through a network-linked system vulnerability, and exploit 
the data synchronisation function of the network-linked system to spread 
malicious code to the business side server. The actors then compromised the 
business PC with malicious code to steal information. 
4. Malicious code installed on the business PC had two C2 servers, the first of which 
was the business side server of the network-linked system, which acts as a 
gateway in the middle, while the second C2 is located on the external internet. 
This malicious code was able to exfiltrate initial beacon data and download and 
execute encrypted payloads. The malicious code then attempted to move from 
the internal server of the network-linked solution to the external server to send 
the initial beacon to the C2 server, but was blocked by the security policy of the 
solution. If it hadn’t been blocked, large amounts of information stored in the 
internal network could have been leaked. 
See the IoC section for C2 server, MD5 hashes, encryption algorithms, and file 
certificates. Further detailed information on the security authentication software 
attack can be found on the English and Korean language blogs by Ahnlab.

Summary and Preventative Measures 
The cyber actors initially employed a watering-hole attack to secure target groups, 
and conducted additional attacks on specific targets. The compromise of one supply 
chain led to the infection of another supply chain, which was a targeted attack against 
a specific target. The malicious actors used highly sophisticated modus operandi by 
exploiting an undisclosed vulnerability of the network-linked system and a legitimate 
function for intrusion into the intranet.  
System owners should check whether a vulnerable version of software is on the list 
of installed programs, and update the software to the latest version. 
MagicLine4NX 1.0.0.1 ~ 1.0.0.26 were vulnerable. 
Organisations should make sure they control access to the administrator page of the 
network-linked system, and identify any unauthorised services or communications. 
Further detailed information about how to check the vulnerable version can be found 
on the ROK NCSC website. 
 
The compromise of 3CX 
In March 2023, it was widely reported by both SentinelOne and Sophos that the 
Desktop App software distributed by 3CX had been compromised and contained 
malware affecting both macOS and Windows operating systems. This constituted a 
significant global supply chain attack. The security incident was later confirmed by 
3CX. 
 
 
6 
 
 
 
In June 2023 the UK NCSC published a malware analysis report on the macOS malware 
used in the 3CX supply chain attack, named Smooth Operator  
Attack Flow Windows version 
1. The cyber actors added malicious code to an executable file that shipped within a 
signed installer for 3CX software. 
2. The application was distributed to customers via legitimate channels. It is now 
known that the cyber actors had compromised the 3CX network and therefore 
were in a position to compromise the build process of the 3CX software. 
3. When the 3CX software was run, the malicious code would sleep in the 
background for at least 7 days and the 3CX software would continue to run as 
normal. 
4. After the sleep period, the malicious code loaded an encrypted payload which is

appended to a DLL also packaged within the 3CX software. 
5. This payload is responsible for downloading a list of actor-controlled C2 domains 
from a GitHub repository, then reaching out to one of them to download the next 
stage. 
The only observed onward stage was a browser stealer, which would extract and 
exfiltrate basic victim system data, victim 3CX account information and browser 
history from the Brave, Chrome, Edge and Firefox browsers. 
Further detailed information on the Windows attack can be found in the industry from 
ESET and Sophos. 
 
Attack Flow macOS version 
1. The cyber actors added malicious code to an executable file that shipped within 
the signed and notarised 3CX application. 
2. The application was distributed to customers via legitimate channels. It is now 
known that the cyber actors had compromised the 3CX network and were 
therefore in a position to compromise the build process of the 3CX software. 
3. When the 3CX software was run, the malicious code slept in the background for 
between 7 and 20 days, while the 3CX software continued to run as normal. 
4. After the sleep period, the malicious code beaconed to an actor-controlled C2 
server using a customised obfuscation method. The beacon contained basic victim 
machine information. 
 
 
8 
 
 
 
5. The C2 server can deliver further malicious stages to be run by the victim machine, 
but the only observed additional stage collects 3CX account information from a 
configuration file on the victim machine and exfiltrates this to an actor-controlled 
C2 server. 
Further detail about the macOS attack can be found in the NCSC malware analysis report  
Summary and Preventative Measures 
In April 2023 the NCSC published advice on its website regarding the 3CX Desktop App 
security issue. 
The negative impact was limited because the malicious update was quickly detected 
by endpoint detection and response solutions. 
This advisory encourages organisations to follow the advice published by the vendor 
to uninstall the software if you are running an affected version. 
 
Mitigation 
As supply chain attacks can happen at any scale and any point, a wide range of 
measures should be established. The NIS and the NCSC recommend implementing the 
mitigations below, relating to the supply chain life cycle, as well as management and 
technical security measures, to deter supply chain threats. 
 
 
 
 
9 
 
 
 
Management Security Measures  
• Raise your organisation’s awareness of supply chain cyber security, and promote 
understanding of the issue.  
• Provide training on cyber security on a regular basis to help members of your 
organisation spot malicious tactics and attacks, and report them.  
• Identify threats to your organisation’s supply chain. Determine threat priorities, 
and assess impacts when malicious cyber activity occurs, in order to eliminate the 
blind spot.  
• Check the access point to critical data and identify members and supply entities 
who have the authority to access to minimise access privileges. 
Technical Security Measures 
• Make sure you install security updates to maintain the most recent version of 
software, operating systems and anti-virus, to mitigate threats from known 
vulnerabilities.  
• Adopt two-factor authentication for the administration and operation login 
policies, to prevent unauthorised logins from unauthorised users. The UK NCSC 
articles Multi-factor authentication for online services and Device Security 
Guidance provide relevant advice. 
• Monitor network infrastructure so that traffic from supply chain software 
applications is trusted but any anomalous traffic can be detected.  
• Refer to the following articles in order to mitigate security threats posed to the
