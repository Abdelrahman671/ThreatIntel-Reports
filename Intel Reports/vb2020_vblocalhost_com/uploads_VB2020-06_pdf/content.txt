Infection vectors
• Phishing websites
• Spear-phishing emails with malicious 
attachments

Infection vector – phishing websites
• Phishing 
domain similar 
to legitimate 
domain

9
Infection vector – phishing websites
• For a successful attack, the attacker requires 
strong user interaction
• User awareness lowers the success rate of 
this type of attack
• Phishing websites were blocked once noticed

Infection vector – spear phishing
• For a successful attack, the attacker requires user 
interaction
• User awareness lowers the success rate of this type 
of attack
• Applying updates prevents code execution in this 
context
• Malicious documents and C&C were blocked once 
noticed

15
Infection vector – exploiting vulnerabilities
• Exploiting vulnerabilities in security solution’s 
services exposed to Internet
• CVE-2019-9489 (patched Apr 2019)

vectors
• Both vulnerabilities are required for a 
successful attack

18
Infection vector – exploiting vulnerabilities
• For a successful attack, the attacker requires:
• A network access to the management server
• An authentication bypass to such server
• A vulnerability to execute code from this server
• All of these conditions can be mitigated by network 
design and patch management
• Malicious payloads and C&C were blocked once 
noticed

• In some cases: “TCP”, “UDP”
• Loaded through DLL side-loading vulnerabilities in 
signed executables
• Uses anti-disassembly techniques
• Sometimes packed with VMProtect

Port 5688
C&C server
1. connects
2. sends traffic
3. forwards traffic

47
Post-exploitation tools – hub relaying
• Losing control of C&C does not expose the 
backend logic
• C&C is simply a connection information 
forwarder

48
Infrastructure
© 2019 Trend Micro Inc.
49
Infrastructure
• Multiple “clusters” of domain names
• Infrastructure overlap
• Clusters were usually bound to a specific 
malware family

50
Infrastructure

• 49 domains resolving to an IP address
• Of which 38 dynamic domain names
• 46 different IP addresses

51
Infrastructure – attacker’s mistakes
• Attacker misconfigured some C&C servers
• We could find some new malware samples 
and families, as well as victims

60
Links to TICK threat actor
• We found Shadowpad samples sharing 
encryption algorithms with samples from 
TICK (Operation Endtrade)
• This suggests they share a builder
• Shadowpad delivery mechanism is different 
for TICK, they use a dropper named CASPER

61
Conclusion
• Earth Akhlut is an advanced threat actor with 
big operational and offensive capabilities
• Patches need to be applied to security 
solutions
• Public Internet access to management 
servers should be avoided unless necessary
