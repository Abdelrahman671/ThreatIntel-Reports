Unmasking Adversary Infrastructure: How Certificates and
Redirects Exposed Earth Baxia and PlugX Activity
Introduction
Tracking adversary infrastructure often starts with subtle clues. In this case, unconventional certificates and unique
HTTP redirect headers led us to two distinct malicious networks. One network was linked to Earth Baxia, a threat
actor identified by Trend Micro believed to be from China, while the other appears to be connected to PlugX, based
on our telemetry.
While these two infrastructures were tracked independently and are not connected, following these basic indicators
helped us map out clusters of servers likely used in network intrusions. 
This post details the steps taken to uncover and track these networks.
Identifying Earth Baxia Infrastructure
After reviewing the Trend Micro report, we analyzed the IOCs to identify any additional infrastructure potentially
linked to Earth Baxia. Our research uncovered Cloudflare certificates with Subject Alternative Name (SAN)
domains resembling those mentioned in the blog post. SANs are extensions within SSL/TLS certificates that list
additional domain names, or IP addresses a certificate can secure beyond the primary domain.
CloudFlare certificate: 
SubjectCommonName: CloudFlare Origin Certificate\
SubjectOrganization: CloudFlare, Inc.\
SubjectOrganizationalUnit: CloudFlare Origin CA
Issuer Country: US\
IssuerOrganization: CloudFlare, Inc.\
IssuerOrganizationalUnit: CloudFlare Origin SSL Certificate Authority\
IssuerLocality: San Francisco

An example of one of the Cloudflare certificates found at 203.25.119[.]28.
We also discovered several self-signed certificates falsely claimed to have been issued by Microsoft, adding to the
suspicious nature of the infrastructure. Over the same period, many servers hosting these certificates were also
observed to serve the Cloudflare certificates mentioned above. Combined with the HTTP redirects, which we'll
mention shortly, these indicators pointed to a small but distinct cluster of 12 likely malicious servers, all of which we
attribute to Earth Baxia based on our visibility.
The complete list of the IPs, domains, and redirect URLs is included at the end of this post.
"Microsoft" self-signed certificate:
SubjectCommonName: bing[.]com\
SubjectCountry: US\
SubjectOrganization: Microsoft Corporation\
SubjectOrganizationalUnit: Microsoft IT\
SubjectLocality: Redmond\
SubjectProvince: Washington
Issuer data: same as above
This cert was also seen at 203.25.119[.]28 during the same period.
The HTTP 301 redirects we observed were primarily over ports 443 and 8443, directing users to well-known
legitimate websites like the FBI, NASA, and eBay homepages. This technique was likely used to create an illusion
of benign activity, blending malicious behavior into what seemed like standard traffic patterns.
Attackers often leverage open-source redirector tools such as RedGuard or RedWarden to obscure the actual
location of command-and-control (C2) servers and evade detection by researchers. However, in this case, there was
no evidence that either of these tools was employed, suggesting a custom header was used to achieve a similar
effect.
HTTP/1.1  301 Moved Permanently\
Date: Wed, 2 Oct 2024  08:25:21 GMT **Value varies\
Content-Type: text/html\
Content-Length: 106 **Value varies
HTTP 301 redirect used in Earth Baxia malicious servers.
The selection of the redirect URLs used appears strategic, focusing on high-profile organizations in the defense,
intelligence, and software sectors. These choices suggest that the attacker(s) aimed to blend into environments
where military or government-related traffic is commonplace.
Noteworthy Redirect URLs:
www[.]jdf.mil[.]jm: This domain belongs to the Jamaica Defence Force (JDF), Jamaica's official military
organization.
www[.]sap[.]com: Redirects to the official website of SAP, a global leader in enterprise software solutions.
3/6
www[.]mil[.]ru: The official website of the Russian Ministry of Defense, frequently targeted or spoofed in
various campaigns.
www[.]mi6.gov[.]uk: This domain redirects to the UK's Secret Intelligence Service (SIS), commonly referred
to as MI6, which uses the official domain sis.gov[.]uk.
www[.]pao.af[.]mil: A spoof of the Public Affairs Office of the United States Air Force. Visiting this domain
results in an HTTP 400 error.
<html><head><meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=https://www.jdf.mil[.]jm">

Redirect URL hosted at 203.55.176[.]207:8443
Identifying PlugX Servers Through Anomalous Certificates and
Redirects
While hunting for unusual SSL/TLS certificates, our research team came across a small set of servers, some
identified as PlugX C2 nodes. A notable pattern emerged among these IPs--the letters "AES" appeared consistently
in the Subject Organizational Unit field of the certificates.
Examples of the certificates we encountered are below.
SubjectCommonName: Rootxlhijori\
SubjectCountry: yo\
SubjectOrganization: Asfft\
SubjectOrganizationalUnit: AES\
SubjectLocality: nmdmkivk\
SubjectProvince: Lostxoxk
An example certificate for 96.43.101[.]248.
SubjectCommonName: Rootabmxucet\
SubjectCountry: qy\
SubjectOrganization: Asxee\
SubjectOrganizationalUnit: tnkkAES\
SubjectLocality: esfzhk\
SubjectProvince: Losududrj
Suspicious certificated hosted at 45.133.239[.]188.
We developed a Hunt Advanced Search query targeting servers with similar certificate characteristics to narrow our
analysis. This resulted in 5 unique IP addresses, indicating a cluster of infrastructure tied to PlugX operations.
subject.organizational_unit:/AES/ AND subject.common_name:/^[A-Za-z]+$/ AND 
issuer.common_name:/^[A-Za-z]+$/ AND ja4x:c9d784bbb12e_c9d784bbb12e_795797892f9c
Advanced Search query for PlugX linked certificates.
The query is designed to filter for certificates where the OrganizationalUnit field contains 'AES' and both the Subject
CommonName and Issuer CommonName contain only alphabetical characters.
Additionally, the query looks for a specific JA4X fingerprint. The screenshot below shows our findings.
4/6
Figure 1: Query results for suspicious PlugX certificates. Search conducted on 03 October (Hunt Link)
Four of the five results in Figure 1 had ports already detected as PlugX on the Hunt platform:
38.54.85[.]112 -- Ports: 443, 5000
45.133.239[.]188 -- Port: 5000
45.251.243[.]210 -- Port: 6000
96.43.101[.]248 -- Port: 5000
After identifying the IPs tied to the suspicious certificates, we also observed HTTP 302 redirects. These redirects
were consistently seen on ports 80 and 8088, commonly used for unencrypted HTTP traffic. In this case, all the
redirects pointed to the same domain: https://www.google.com.
An example of the redirect header is as follows:
HTTP/1.1  302 ok\
LOCATION: https://www.google.com
The lowercase "ok" in the status code is unusual. It could indicate hastily constructed, or custom HTTP responses
likely meant to mimic legitimate headers while slightly deviating from standard HTTP formatting.
Also, notice the all-caps "LOCATION" header and the redirection to Google.

Conclusion
In this investigation, we uncovered two distinct clusters of malicious infrastructure. The first, tied to Earth Baxia,
revealed suspicious certificates and HTTP 301 redirects that pointed users to trusted sites like the FBI homepage,
suggesting an attempt to obscure malicious activity.
The second set of servers, potentially linked to a more extensive PlugX campaign, was identified by anomalous
certificates containing the "AES" string and HTTP 302 redirects to Google. These minor yet significant anomalies in
certificates and headers helped us identify and track this infrastructure, offering valuable insights for further
investigation and defense.
Monitoring indicators like those discussed above lets defenders pinpoint suspicious infrastructure early on, allowing
them to uncover malicious activity before an attack is fully underway. This proactive approach gives security teams a
valuable head start in preventing potential threats from escalating.
