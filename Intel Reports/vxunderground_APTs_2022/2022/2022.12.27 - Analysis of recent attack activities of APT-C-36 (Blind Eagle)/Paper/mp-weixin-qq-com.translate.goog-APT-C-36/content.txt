APT-C-36
  blind eagle
APT-C-36 (Blind Eagle) is an APT organization suspected to be from South America. Its main targets are located in
Colombia and some areas in South America, such as Ecuador and Panama. Since its discovery in 2018, the
organization has continued to launch targeted attacks against Colombian government departments, financial,
insurance and other industries, as well as large companies.
APT-C-36 often uses harpoon attacks recently, using PDF files as entry points to induce users to click malicious links
in the documents to download RAR compressed files. Most compressed files need a password to decompress. The
password is basically a 4-digit pure number. After decompression, it is a VBS script disguised as a PDF file name.
After the VBS script is clicked and executed by the user, it will start a complex and multi-stage fileless attack chain.
The final loader is an obfuscated AsyncRAT or NjRAT Trojan, and the code to bypass the AMSI mechanism is added,
which shows that the organization is constantly optimizing its attack weapon.
1. Attack activity analysis
1. Attack process analysis
2/9
The figure above shows the complete attack flow of some payloads of this attack. The attacker induces the user to
download the malicious compressed package file, executes the VBS script in it, and loads the first-stage DLL
downloaded from the remote end into memory, and the DLL continues to load the second-stage DLL in memory. In
order to hide the final malicious code, the second-stage DLL will inject the AsyncRAT or NjRAT Trojan into the puppet
process RegAsm or AppLaunch.exe for execution. The last loaded Trojan program establishes communication with
the C2 server to realize the remote control function. It should be noted that attackers often use mail servers or text
storage service websites (such as Paste.ee) to save the payload in order not to be intercepted when downloading the
attack payload.
2. Load delivery analysis
Most of the samples captured this time are compressed files, and some samples require a 4-digit pure digital
password to decompress, and the functions of the decompressed files are similar.
The following takes one of the malicious sample files as an example to introduce its attack chain in detail.

1.42KB
MD5 8d8b7131bdf067e3d9c3abff9ee74ad8
The file is a RAR compressed package file, which contains a VBS file with the same name as the RAR file, and the
file name is very long, and the suffix is ​​pdf.rar, so users can easily click on it without paying attention to get tricked. In
addition, the content of the VBS file is full of a large amount of useless data and obfuscated malicious code, and the
word "Updated" can be clearly seen. It can be speculated that the attack took place after September 15, 2022.
The key codes obtained by de-obfuscation are as follows:
Malicious code downloads the encoded DLL data from the address https://contadoreshbc.com/dll_startup , calls the
Fiber.Home.VAI method, implements reflective loading of the DLL, and passes in parameters, the parameters are in
reverse order of the URL (URL: https://mail
.cmconcretos.com/home/cartera@cmconcretos.com/Briefcase/prueba4.txt?disp=a&ver=1) as the first stage loader.
3. Attack component analysis
3/9
Stage 1 DLL
(MD5: 8061f477cfa49c8d2f2aa7cc19e3d09d)
The VAI method first moves itself to the %ProgramData% directory and names it Done.VBS, then downloads the file
from https://schoolcrypter.com/Rump , replaces the specified string and decodes it to get the second-stage DLL file.
Then call the Fsociety.Tools.Ande method of the second stage DLL, the parameter is
"C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework \\v4.0.30319 \\RegAsm.exe " (injected program) and the final malicious
code (Downloaded and decoded data from the remote link parameter passed in by the VBS script).
Stage 2 DLL
(MD5: 3c929b58ba69cee4e5e8714b4b3d7e12)
In this stage, the RegAsm.exe process is created and the downloaded malicious load is injected into it to achieve the
purpose of hiding the process. The figure below shows some APIs required for injection operations.
4/9
final loaded load
(MD5: 6969d415553f93d9bd39fc93dc6cfbda)
According to the analysis, we found that the final payload is an AsyncRAT remote control Trojan that has been
redeveloped and obfuscated by SmartAssembly. AsyncRAT is an open source remote control Trojan horse program
written in C# language. Its functions include process monitoring, file management, remote desktop, keylogging and
other remote control functions. It also includes anti-virtual machine, anti-debugging, anti-sandbox, etc. a
countermeasure technique.
After the payload is executed, first call Settings.InitializeSettings to load the configuration information, obtain the Key
through Base64 decoding, and then use the AES algorithm to decrypt to obtain important configurations such as
Ports, Host, Version, Install, MTX, Anti information.

According to the Anti attribute of the configuration file, it is decided whether to detect the environment, mainly to
detect Vmware and VirtualBox virtual machines, anti-debugging, sandbox, hard disk capacity, and whether it is an XP
system.
Determine whether PasteBin is empty, if it is empty, take the host information (domain name/IP) and port from the
configuration information, check the validity of the host, and then connect. If PasteBin is not empty, use ":" as the
separator to connect to the host information and port respectively. It can be seen that the C2 of the RAT has strong
scalability and flexibility.

After the SSL connection is established between the client and the server, the HWID (hardware ID), User (user
name), OS and other host information of the controlled machine are collected by calling the IdSender.SendInfo()
method.
In addition, the remote control Trojan program contains multiple functional modules, mainly including file
management, file search, keylogging, process management, remote desktop, remote camera, etc. These functions
exist as modules alone, and do not exist in the client program. According to the required functions, different modules
are sent to the client, and the corresponding functions are executed on the client.

It is important to note that when analyzing other attack components, we found that some AsyncRAT payloads have
added codes to bypass AMSI, mainly by hooking the AmsiScanBuffer function in amsi.dll to return a normal result,
thereby bypassing detection and allowing Its malicious program executes normally.

7/9
2. Correlation analysis
This attack sample is very similar to the attack samples we captured in the first half of this year, and both belong to
the APT-C-36 organization. The attack payload information discovered in the first half of the year is as follows:
file name
multas transit-jpg.bz2
File size
9.09KB
MD5
1511dcd31e221764c10875186cf47a93
The sample is of RAR type, downloaded from http://tiny.cc/5pkquz. A password is required for decompression, which
is very similar to some samples found this time (MD5: a15236e342b18306c76dfbe6cf8f7966).
After decompression, it becomes a VBS script. The general execution process of this script is basically similar to the
attack process of this attack. It also adopts the method of multi-stage loading of the final open source RAT. The
difference is that the DLL in the first stage is decrypted locally, not loaded from the remote end, and the open-source
Trojan horse NjRAT is finally injected.
In addition, it should be noted that the RAR decompression password and download links are often provided through
PDF disguised documents. As shown in the figure below, the victim is induced to click on the URL that is actually a
malicious short link (http://tiny.cc/5pkquz) to download the RAR compressed file, and reminds the compressed file
that the password is 2022, inducing the user to open the malicious file.
8/9
Combined with the previous delivery methods of the APT-C-36 organization, there is every reason to believe that the
delivery of this payload is also through such documents to lure users to click and download the compressed package.
Unfortunately, this time it is not completely related to the relevant decoy files.
In addition, a malicious program hosted by the organization on the cmconcretos.com mail server was discovered
during this sample traceability analysis. These programs were uploaded around September 22, 2022, and are
constantly being updated, indicating that the attack occurred just before the time at this stage.
The RAR compressed package in the server basically needs a password (4-digit pure number) to open, and the file
name is in Spanish, and after decompression, it is also a VBS script with a long file name with the word PDF. Through
analysis, we found a download link https://paste.ee/d/amsfg/0 in one of the compressed packages, indicating that the
malicious code was placed on the paste.ee platform, and the organization once hosted the malicious code on the
pastebin platform , the difference being that the former is used without restriction. In addition, the mailbox server and
C2 are basically located in Colombia, and the source of some samples is shown as Colombia. Combined with the
entire attack chain of the sample, it is consistent with the attack characteristics and goals of the APT-C-36
organization. In summary, we have reasons to attribute it to the APT-C-36 (Blind Eagle) organization.
Summarize
The APT-C-36 (Blind Eagle) organization has been attacking Colombia and surrounding countries for a long time, and
hosts some malicious codes on public service platforms such as paste.ee and mail servers to hide the traces of the
attack. At the same time, in response to the ever-improving security defense detection system, the organization
modified and confused various types of open-source Trojans (such as NjRAT and SyncRAT) to meet the needs of
different scenarios. The Trojans used in this attack were confused by SmartAssembly , and part of the payload added
code that bypasses the AMSI mechanism, which all indicate that the organization is continuously updating the
function and form of the malicious code, and presents the characteristics of functionalization and modularization.
In addition, the relevant malicious code and C2 disclosed in this article are only the latest weapons used in some
attacks by the APT-C-36 (Blind Eagle) organization, and we will continue to pay attention to the attack activities of this
9/9
organization in the future.
