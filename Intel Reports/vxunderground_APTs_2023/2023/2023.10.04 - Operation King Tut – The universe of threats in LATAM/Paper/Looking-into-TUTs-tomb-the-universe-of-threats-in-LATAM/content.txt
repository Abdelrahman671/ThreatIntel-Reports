VIRUS BULLETIN CONFERENCE OCTOBER 2023
ABSTRACT
As in the tomb of Pharaoh Tutankhamun, aka King Tut, the threat landscape in Latin America is shrouded in mystery, 
mostly because the evolution of malicious campaigns in the region doesn’t get much attention. The ATM attacks [1], the 
banking trojans born in Brazil [2], and the Machete [3] cyberespionage operations all made the news – but there is more to 
the story. Just as the archaeological excavations of King Tut’s tomb helped us understand life in ancient Egypt, the research 
that we have carried out in the past five years contributes to a broader understanding of the threat landscape in Latin 
America.
In recent years, that region has experienced a significant increase in the number and sophistication of malicious campaigns. 
Whether it’s advanced social engineering techniques or improved multi-stage compromise chains, LATAM cybercriminals 
have been upping their game.
In this presentation we will share details from our recent investigations, which confirm this trend. For example, Operation 
Red Octopus [4], in which the cybercriminals’ phishing emails impersonated governmental entities from Ecuador, and 
Operation Spalax [5], in which cybercriminals used steganography to deliver the Remcos RAT in disguise. Along with 
these two, we have been tracking dozens of campaigns with particular characteristics in various countries of the region.
Next, we will draw from our experience in tracking these types of campaigns and will contribute our knowledge for the 
understanding of the region’s malicious ecosystem. These contributions are made around three main topics: cybercriminal 
motivation, diverse sets of techniques, and the differences between the operations across the countries in the region. 
These topics demonstrate the shift from simple, opportunistic crimeware to more complex threats. Notably, we will look at 
how their targets shifted from the general public to high-profile users, including businesses and governmental entities. We 
will look at the persistence with which the cybercriminals update their tools again and again, introducing different evasion 
techniques to increase the success of their campaigns. Finally, we will look at how they expanded their crimeware business 
to countries outside Latin America, just as we have seen with the banking trojans born in Brazil.
INTRODUCTION
In the past five years, the ESET Research team has been documenting cybercriminal activity in the Latin American 
region. Although the term ‘cybercriminal activity’ is normally associated with threat actors that operate globally, such as 
botnet operators or ransomware groups, in this paper we use it to refer to campaigns and operations in which the vast 
majority, if not all, of the victims are in Latin American countries. Additionally, it has been observed that the attackers 
behind these operations are residents of the region, as indicated by certain characteristics discussed in the investigations 
presented in this paper.
This paper is divided into four parts. The first part focuses on describing three regional operations that serve as examples to 
illustrate the structure and modus operandi of threat actors in the region. Moving on to the second part, a summary is 
provided of the analysis conducted on at least ten campaigns, utilizing the Cyber Kill Chain [6] framework. This analysis 
aids in gaining insight into the similarities and differences within the Latin American threat landscape. The third part of the 
document delves into one specific campaign and other instances of malware with unique characteristics that deviate from 
the norm. This exploration showcases the continuous evolution of these operations in the region, highlighting exceptions to 
the established patterns.
Finally, in the last section, the conclusions drawn from the research are presented, summarizing the key findings. It is 
important to note that the paper relies solely on investigations carried out by ESET.
CASE STUDIES
In the following subsections we present a detailed analysis of three operations investigated in recent years. These 
operations provide an overview of cybercriminal activity in the Latin American region.
Operation Spalax
Operation Spalax [5] occurred in 2020 and was strongly focused on Colombian entities, particularly government 
institutions and private companies. In this operation, the attackers used targeted spear-phishing techniques impersonating 
entities such as the SIMIT (a system for paying transit violations in Colombia) and the DIAN (the National Directorate of 
Taxes and Customs).
Figures 1 and 2 show examples of the phishing emails used in Operation Spalax. The topics used for these emails were 
diverse, but in all cases they were related to important personal events that require immediate action, for example:
•	 A notification about a driving infraction
•	 A notification to attend a court hearing
•	 A notification of an embargo of bank accounts

In most cases, these emails had an attached document containing a URL pointing to a malicious archive. The attackers used 
different legitimate hosting services, such as OneDrive or MediaFire, to host their payloads.
Once downloaded and unzipped, the malicious file was responsible for decrypting and running a remote access trojan on 
the victim’s computer. We observed three distinct types of droppers, which we describe in the following subsections.

VIRUS BULLETIN CONFERENCE OCTOBER 2023
Malicious NSIS installers
As a measure to evade detection, these installers contain several benign files as well as two malicious files, an 
encrypted RAT and a DLL used to decrypt and execute the malware. The DLL is executed with the legitimate binary 
rundll32.exe.
Figure 3: NSIS script for one of the droppers; the malicious files are highlighted – Bonehead being the encrypted RAT, and 
ShoonCataclysm.dll the dropper.
AgentTesla packers
These packers make use of steganography and other packers like CyaX to hide the RAT that ends up running on the 
victim’s system. In addition, they use benign dead code as an evasion measure. The payload ends up being decrypted and 
executed in the same address space, or injected into a new process.
Figure 4 (on the following page) shows the hard-coded configuration in the CyaX-Sharp packer.
AutoIt droppers
The attackers also used AutoIt packers that were heavily obfuscated and contained two shellcodes: one to decrypt the 
payload, the other to inject it into a process. The payload is constructed by concatenating several strings and then invoking 
a decryption function that uses a single-byte XOR algorithm. Figure 5 shows the concatenation of the payload.

During the course of Operation Spalax, the operators used different commodity malware as the final payload:
•	 Remcos, where most of the samples were from version v2.5.0 Pro.
•	 njRAT, where most of the samples were from version v0.7.3 (Lime Edition), but version v0.7.d (Green Edition) was 
also used.
•	 AsyncRAT, where version v0.5.7B was used.
It’s important to mention that the NSIS installers, AgentTesla packers, and the malware used in this operation are not used 
exclusively by these operators; they are also used by other cybercriminals in the region, and in some cases appear worldwide.
Finally, the attackers used extensive network infrastructure: during our research into Operation Spalax we discovered 
approximately 70 different domain names used for C&C corresponding to at least 24 IP addresses. The IPs associated with 
them came from Colombian ISPs in most cases, although the use of VPN services such as Powerhouse Management was 
also seen. Regarding the domains used, they were registered with Duck DNS and DNS Exit.

Operation Red Octopus
Operation Red Octopus [4] occurred during June and July 2022 and was strongly focused on victims in Ecuador, 
particularly government entities and institutions in the healthcare sector. In this operation the attackers used spear-phishing 
techniques, in most cases impersonating the Attorney General’s Office of the State of Ecuador using themes such as 
lawsuits or judicial processes.
These emails contain a URL that leads the victim to download a password-protected archive hosted on Google Drive 
Figure 6 shows an example of an email sent in the Operation Red Octopus campaign.
Figure 6: Example of a phishing email used in Operation Red Octopus.
The following are some examples of the names used for the downloaded archives (translated into English):
•	 Administrative lawsuit criminal trial
•	 Bank transfer proof attached
•	 Criminal process trial demand filed
•	 Prosecutor criminal process trial demand filed
In order to trick the victims into executing the malicious executable file, the attackers used the Microsoft Word icon.
The downloaded file is intended to execute malicious PowerShell code with administrator privileges. If the file is not 
running with these permissions, it performs the following two actions:
1.	 Copies itself into the %TEMP% folder, renaming itself as IntAnalyticsManager.exe.
2.	 Creates a Windows folder (with a space at the end) in the victim’s root directory.
Into this last directory, it copies the official Windows Standalone Installer known as wusa.exe, together with a DLL named 
WTSAPI32.dll. This DLL is hidden in the payload resources.
Having done this, the payload performs a UAC bypass by executing wusa.exe, which proceeds to load the fake 
WTSAPI32.dll. This DLL can then run PowerShell code with elevated privileges.

Figure 8: Deobfuscated malicious PowerShell code.
The PowerShell payload downloads two files hosted on the instant message platform Discord. These files are:
•	 A DLL that modifies the behaviour of the Windows APIs AmsiScanBuffer and EtwEventWrite
•	 A ZIP file
This new ZIP file contains another executable file, along with other benign DLLs, which has several checks to determine 
whether the file is being executed in a virtual machine or sandbox.
If these checks are met, it decrypts the final payload from its resources to copy it to the C:\ProgramData\data directory, 
and to maintain persistence it creates a scheduled task.
Figure 9: Scheduled task configuration used for the malware’s persistence.
Lastly, of the samples analysed in Operation Red Octopus, it was found that the operators mostly used the malware known 
as Remcos v3.4.1Pro, although we also saw that they used AsyncRAT v0.5.7B.
Operation Guinea Pig
Operation Guinea Pig [7] occurred during the month of March 2023 and, unlike the previous ones, was not strongly focused 
on a particular country but spread to different countries in Latin America, including Mexico, Peru, Colombia and Ecuador.
Although in this operation the attackers also made use of phishing emails, they did not take many precautions to craft emails 
that impersonate entities specific to each country; instead they chose to impersonate a well-known package delivery company.
Although this practice is very common in campaigns with a global reach, in this case the operators, in addition to writing 
the content in Spanish, were unusually friendly. This can be seen by the beginning of the body of the email where it says 
‘Buen día amigo’ which translates into English as ‘Good morning, friend’, showing that the operators were not very 
interested in creating a convincing or urgent email.

Figure 10: Example of a phishing email used in Operation Guinea Pig.
These emails contain an archive attachment, which in turn contains an executable file that uses the so-called ‘double 
extension’ and also uses the icon of a well-known virtualization software.
Figure 11: Executable file abusing the so-called ‘double extension’.
This file is in charge of executing malicious VBS code, which invokes the PowerShell interpreter to download a malicious 
DLL. In this operation, the operators abused the provider ngrok to host their malicious artifacts. This DLL is in charge of 
downloading the AgentTesla RAT, which proceeds to inject the RAT through the process hollowing [8] technique into the 
RegSvcs.exe process.
DISCOVERING THE THREAT ECOSYSTEM
Apart from the case studies described in the previous section, over the course of the past few years the ESET Research team 
has documented different campaigns operating in the region, as can be seen in the following timeline.
Figure 12: Timeline of publications on attacks in LATAM, tracked by ESET.
Although each of these operations exhibits distinct characteristics, and it is not considered that they are associated with the 
same threat actor, it is highly likely that multiple actors are involved. It is important to highlight that the malicious 
operations analysed in this study are limited to specific campaigns exclusively detected in Latin America, rather than 
encompassing massive campaigns primarily associated with global crimeware.

VIRUS BULLETIN CONFERENCE OCTOBER 2023
To compare the characteristics of the analysed operations, we will use the seven stages of the Cyber Kill Chain framework 
[6] as a reference to describe the threat ecosystem that both organizations and individuals face in Latin America and to 
understand the similarities that exist.
Reconnaissance
Our analysis reveals that most of the malicious campaigns detected in the region target enterprise users, and even 
government sectors. These campaigns demonstrate a remarkable degree of sophistication and a deep understanding of their 
potential victims. The level of specificity and precision observed in these attacks suggests a high degree of targeting, 
indicating that the threat actors possess detailed knowledge about their intended victims.
This emphasis on precision targeting showcases the evolution of cybercriminal strategies in the region, where attackers are 
increasingly investing in research and reconnaissance to maximize the impact of their campaigns.
Weaponization
Regarding the tools used in malicious operations in Latin America, we have observed that RATs (remote access trojans) are 
the preferred type of malware, in particular the njRAT and AsyncRAT families. To a lesser extent, in campaigns focused on 
government entities, the use of other families, such as Bandook and Remcos, has also been detected. 
In terms of the infrastructure used for the propagation of these campaigns, it is common to find the abuse of free 
file‑hosting services such as Google Drive, gulf-up, SpiderOAK, pCloud, or up-00, although there is a shift toward the 
misuse of services like Discord and Archive.org. The use of compromised infrastructure of legitimate websites or the 
purchase of infrastructure is less common in these types of campaigns.
Delivery
Given the approach of the analysed campaigns, it is not surprising that the main mechanism used by adversaries to reach 
potential victims is email. Most of these campaigns are highly localized in different countries of the region and impersonate 
recognized entities in each territory, mainly government or tax entities, although they are not focused on specific users 
inside the targeted companies.
This approach suggests that the threat actors prioritize the broad impact of their operations rather than focusing on specific 
individuals or roles within the targeted organizations. By employing this strategy, the adversaries aim to exploit any 
weaknesses in the organization’s security defences and potentially exfiltrate sensitive information.
Exploitation and installation
In summary, the analysed malicious campaigns follow a common pattern in the exploitation and installation phases, 
according to the Cyber Kill Chain model:
•	 These malicious campaigns consist of multiple stages involving the utilization of malicious components such as 
downloaders and droppers, particularly in PowerShell and VBS. These components are used to carry out 
modifications to the operating system, enabling the download, execution, and persistence of payloads, mainly RAT 
malware.
•	 Modifications are made to system components, such as AmsiScanBuffer and EtwEventWrite, to allow smooth 
execution of malicious artifacts.
•	 Campaigns often have long propagation and infection chains, starting with an email that runs a script to prepare the 
system and download malicious components, all the way to the final payload that allows access to victim 
information.
•	 The process hollowing technique, which hides the malicious code within a legitimate process of the operating system, 
is repeatedly used to achieve the execution of processes in a stealthy manner.
•	 Obfuscation at multiple levels is common in all the malicious campaigns analysed, since scripting techniques are used 
to drive the process of infestation.
•	 Persistence is mainly sought for the final payload, and the most common ways are via system scheduled tasks or 
copying to the Startup Folder. Adding Windows registry keys is more commonly used for executing components 
directly in memory, rather than for persistence.
Command and control
The way that the attackers establish command and control (C&C) with their victims is related to the type of malware used. 
However, it is common to find abuse of dynamic DNS (DDNS) services, with DuckDNS and No-IP being the most widely 
used.

Actions on objectives
Since the malicious actors seek to deploy RATs, it is clear that their primary goal is to steal personal and financial 
information. Although the region is not exempt from threats that can lead to extortion and blackmail, these are not 
addressed in the context of the analysed campaigns, since they are part of more global campaigns that may eventually 
affect users in the region.
Table 1 (on the following page) presents a concise summary of the key characteristics observed in the analysed operations, 
organized according to the phases of the Cyber Kill Chain.
EXCEPTIONS TO THE RULE
With everything mentioned so far, a trend toward the use of commodity malware can be seen in the different campaigns or 
operations discovered in the region, but there are certain cases where we see threat actors carrying out espionage campaigns 
with more sophisticated malware.
An example of this is Operation Jacana, which occurred during the first half of 2023. Its main objective was to spy on 
Guyanese government entities using undocumented malware that we have named DinodasRAT.
During the course of Operation Jacana, we saw that the operators had knowledge of the geopolitical activities of the 
country and abused this knowledge to create specially crafted emails to deceive their victims.
In addition, DinodasRAT is malware written in C++ that can perform different actions on a victim’s machine, such as 
listing running processes, executing commands with cmd.exe, and listing files and folders, among others.
Given the characteristics of Operation Jacana, we came to the conclusion that it is a more traditional espionage operation 
rather than a financially-motivated information-stealing campaign like most other campaigns that affect the region.
ESET has also identified notable exceptions to the established patterns, particularly concerning the infamous banking 
trojans. While these trojans predominantly target residents of Brazil, there has been a growing trend of their presence in 
other Latin American countries. Additionally, instances of these banking trojans have even been detected in European 
countries.
One characteristic that most banking trojans share is that they are developed in Delphi, but in recent years we have 
discovered and documented two new banking trojans, known as Janeleiro [15] and Spy.Banker.FN, which have an 
important difference: the use of the Microsoft .NET framework. Although we do not have enough information to know 
whether there is any relationship between these new banking trojans and those documented previously, this difference 
could indicate that the operators are testing different programming languages or that new operators may be appearing with 
their own toolsets, while usually in the rest of LATAM we see attackers using existing tools. 
CONCLUSION
Based on our investigation we have reached the following conclusions.
First, the attackers behind all these operations or cybercriminal activities seem to be motivated primarily by financial gain. 
Although it is true that many of the malware families used have functionalities to spy on their victims, given the number of 
victims that we have seen in these operations and the variety of organizations targeted – for example, health organizations, 
government entities, and private companies, among others – we think that they are more in search of the personal 
information of victims to sell in underground forums or to compromise accounts for future campaigns. At the same time, it 
is important to acknowledge that several countries in the region face challenges in achieving a consistent economic 
standard for their population. While the specific reasons vary across each country, discussing them in detail falls beyond 
the scope of this paper. However, we believe that these economic disparities could potentially influence the behaviour of 
operators in the region.
Also, we have seen that these cybercriminal groups are actively looking into different techniques and ways for their 
campaigns to be as successful as possible, whether that’s by sending very convincing emails to dupe the victim or seeking 
to evade some security solution.
On the other hand, although there are cybercriminal groups, such as Blind Eagle [16], that exclusively target users in 
Latin America, attributing these campaigns to a single group would not be technically accurate. From the analysis 
proposed throughout the paper, we can conclude that there is more than just one group behind the propagation of this 
type of campaign seeking financial gain. Although over the years there has been talk of other threats that affect the 
region, such as banking trojans or the Machete APT group, we believe that our paper helps to give a little more visibility 
into another part of cybercriminal activity. This is significant because it forms a crucial part of the cyber threat 
landscape in the region.
Finally, Latin America is a region that needs to keep improving its cybersecurity defences since these types of 
cybercriminal activity and espionage campaigns are not only going to continue through time, but may also increase in 
sophistication.
