In the recent past, cyberattacks on Indian government entities by Pakistan-linked APTs have gained significant
momentum. Seqrite Labs APT team has discovered multiple such campaigns during telemetry analysis and hunting
in the wild. One such threat group, SideCopy, has deployed its commonly used AllaKore RAT in three separate
campaigns over the last few weeks, where two such RATs were deployed at a time in each campaign. During the
same events, its parent APT group Transparent Tribe (APT36) continuously used Crimson RAT but with either an
encoded or a packed version. Based on their C2 infrastructure, we were able to correlate these APTs, proving their
sub-divisional relation once again. This blog overviews these campaigns and how a connection is established by
looking at their previous attacks.
India is one of the most targeted countries in the cyber threat landscape where not only Pakistan-linked APT groups
like SideCopy and APT36 (Transparent Tribe) have targeted India but also new spear-phishing campaigns such as
Operation RusticWeb and FlightNight have emerged. At the same time, we have observed an increase in the sale of
access to Indian entities (both government and corporate) by initial access brokers in the underground forums, high-
profile ransomware attacks, and more than 2900 disruptive attacks such as DDoS, website defacement and database
leaks by 85+ Telegram Hacktivist groups in the first quarter of 2024.
Threat Actor Profile
2/22
SideCopy is a Pakistan-linked Advanced Persistent Threat group that has been targeting South Asian countries,
primarily the Indian defense and government entities, since at least 2019. Its arsenal includes Ares RAT, Action RAT,
AllaKore RAT, Reverse RAT, Margulas RAT and more. Transparent Tribe (APT36), its parent threat group with the
same persistent targeting, shares code similarity and constantly updates its Linux malware arsenal. Active since
2013, it has continuously used payloads such as Crimson RAT, Capra RAT, Eliza RAT and Oblique RAT in its
campaigns.
SideCopy
So far, three attack campaigns with the same infection chain have been observed, using compromised domains to
host payloads. Instead of side-loading the Action RAT (DUser.dll) payload, as seen previously, two custom variants of
an open-source remote agent called AllaKore are deployed as the final payload.

Infection Process
1. Spear-phishing starts with an archive file containing a shortcut (LNK) in a double-extension format.
2. Opening the LNK triggers the MSHTA process, which executes a remote HTA file hosted on a compromised
domain. The stage-1 HTA contains two embedded files, a decoy and a DLL, that are base64 encoded.
3. DLL is triggered to run in-memory where the decoy file is dropped & opened by it. As previously seen, the DLL
creates multiple text files that mention the name “Mahesh Chand” and various other random texts.
4. Later, the DLL will download two HTA files from the same compromised domain to begin its second stage
process.
5. Both the HTA contain embedded files, this time an EXE and two DLLs.
6. One of the DLLs is executed in-memory, which drops the remaining two files into the public directory after
decoding them. Persistence on the final payload is set beforehand via the Run registry key. One
example:
REG ADD “HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run” /V “issas” /t REG_SZ /F /D
“C:\Users\Public\issas\issas.exe”
Fig. 2 – Files dropped in one of the campaigns
1. Lastly, both the final payloads, which is AllaKore RAT, are executed and connected with the same IP but
different port numbers for C2 communication. The final DLL is not side-loaded but is completely legitimate and
old file.
An in-depth analysis of each stage can be checked in our previous blogs and whitepapers. It contains timers for
timeout, reconnection, clipboard, and separate sockets for desktop, files, and keyboard. The functionality of AllaKore
includes:
Gathering system information
4/22
Enumerating files and folders
Upload and execute files
Keylogging
Steal clipboard data

Initially, the RAT sends and receives ping-pong commands, listening to the C2 for commands to know that the
connection is alive. Both RAT payloads run together, complementing each other, as seen in the network traffic below.
Their sizes are also different: one is 3.2 MB, and the other almost doubles to 7 MB, like Double Action RAT. A
connection ID based on the system information is created for each instance.

Various file operations have been incorporated, including create, delete, execute, copy, move, rename, zip, and
upload, which are part of the AllaKore agent. These commands were found in the bigger payload.

The DLL files dropped are not sideloaded by the AllaKore RAT, and they are legitimate files that could be later used
for malicious purposes. These are Microsoft Windows-related libraries, but only a few contain a valid signature.

Decoys
Two decoy files have been observed, where one was used in previous campaigns in February-March 2023. The date
in the document, “21 December 2022,” has been removed, and the bait’s name has been changed to indicate March
2024 – “Grant_of_Risk_and_HardShip_Allowances_Mar_24.pdf.” As the name suggests, it is an advisory from 2022
on allowance grants to Army officers under India’s Ministry of Defence. This is used in two of the three campaigns.

Fig. 7 – Decoy (1)
The second decoy is related to the same allowance category and mentions payment in arrears form. This is another
old document used previously, dated 19 January 2023.

C2 servers of AllaKore RAT are registered in Germany to AS51167 – Contabo GmbH, commonly used by SideCopy.
Based on the attack chain and arsenal used, these campaigns are attributed to SideCopy, which has high confidence
and uses similar infrastructure to carry out the infection.

The following chart depicts telemetry hits observed for all three SideCopy campaigns related to AllaKore RAT. The
first two campaigns indicate a spike twice in March, whereas the third campaign is observed during the second week
of April.

Transparent Tribe
Many Crimson RAT samples are seen regularly on the VirusTotal platform, with a detection rate of around 40-50. In
our threat hunting, we have found new samples but have had very few detections.
10/22
Fig. 10 – Infection Chain of APT36
Analyzing the infection chain to observe any changes, we found that the Crimson RAT samples are not embedded
directly into the maldocs as they usually are. This time, the maldoc in the XLAM form contained three objects: the
decoy and base64-encoded blobs.
11/22
Fig. 11 – Additional Functions in Macro
After extracting the VBA macro, we see additional functions for reading a file, decoding base64, and converting
binary to string. The macro reads and decodes the two base64 blobs embedded inside the maldoc. This contains
archived Crimson RAT executed samples, after which the decoy file is opened.
12/22
Fig. 12 – VBA infection flow
Crimson RAT
The final RAT payloads contain the same functionality where 22 commands for C2 communication are used. As the
detection rate is typically high for this Crimson RAT, we see a low rate for both these samples. These .NET samples
have compilation timestamp of 2024-03-17 and PDB as:
“C:\New folder\mulhiar tarsnib\mulhiar tarsnib\obj\Debug\mulhiar tarsnib.pdb”
Fig. 13 – Detection count on VT
No major changes were observed when the C2 commands were checked along with the process flow. IP of the C2 is
204.44.124[.]134, which tries to check the connection with 5 different ports – 9149, 15597, 18518, 26791, 28329.
Below, you can find C2 commands for some of the recent samples (compile-timestamp-wise) of Crimson RAT, which
uses similar 22 to 24 commands. All of these are not packed (except the last two) and have the same size range of
10-20 MB.
13/22
Fig. 14 – C2 commands of Crimson RAT for recent samples
As seen in BinDiff, similarity with previous samples is always more than 75%. Changes in the order of the command
interpreted by the RAT were only found with numerical addition or splitting the command in two.
14/22
Fig. 15 – Comparing similarity between Crimson RAT variants
Additionally, two new samples that were obfuscated with Eziriz’s .NET Reactor were also found which are named
‘ShareX’ and ‘Analytics Based Card.’ APT36 has used different packers and obfuscators like ConfuserEx, Crypto
Obfusator, and Eazfuscator, in the past. Compared with the previous iteration, the regular ones contain 22-24
commands as usual, whereas the obfuscated one contains 40 commands. The C2, in this case, is
juichangchi[.]online trying to connect with four ports – 909, 67, 65, 121. A few of these C2 commands don’t have
functionality yet, but they are similar to the ones first documented by Proofpoint. The list of all 22 commands and their
functionality can be found in our previous whitepaper on APT36.

Decoys
The maldoc named “Imp message from dgms” contains DGMS, which stands for India’s Directorate General of Mines
Safety. The decoy document contains various points relating to land and urban policies associated with military or
defense, showing its intended targeting of the Indian Government. Another maldoc named “All details” is empty but
has a heading called posting list.
Fig. 17 – DGMS decoy
Crimson Keylogger
A malicious .NET file with a similar PDB naming convention to Crimson RAT was recently seen, with a compilation
timestamp of 2023-06-14. Analysis led to a keylogger payload that captures all keyboard activity.
PDB: e:\vdhrh madtvin\vdhrh madtvin\obj\Debug\vdhrh madtvin.pdb
Apart from capturing each keystroke and writing it into a file, it collects the name of the current process in the
foreground. Toggle keys are captured separately and based on key combinations; clipboard data is also copied to the
storage file.
16/22

Correlation
Similar to the code overlaps seen previously between SideCopy and APT36 in Linux-based payloads, based on the
domain used as C2 by Transparent Tribe, we pivot to see passive DNS replications of the domain using Virus Total
and Validin. The C2 for the above two packed samples resolved to different IPs – 176.107.182[.]55 and
162.245.191[.]214, as seen in the below timeline, giving us when they went live.
17/22
Fig. 19 – Timeline of C2 domain
This also leads us to two additional IP addresses: 155.94.209[.]4 and 162.255.119[.]207. The first one is
communicating with a payload having detections of only 7/73 on Virus Total, whereas the latter is not associated with
new malware. The malware seems to be another .NET Reactor packed payload with compile timestamp as 2039-02-
24 but small (6.55 MB) compared to the Crimson RAT payloads.
Fig. 20 – Deobufscated AllaKore RAT
The default name of the sample is an Indian language word “Kuchbhi.pdb” meaning anything. After deobfuscation, we
see C2 commands that are similar to the above Delphi-based AllaKore RAT deployed by SideCopy. Only this time it is
in a .NET variant with the following five commands:
C2 Command
Function
LIST_DRIVES
Retrieve and send list of drives on the machine
18/22
LIST_FILES
Enumerate files and folder in the given path
UPLOAD_FILE
Download and execute file
PING
Listening to C2 and send PONG for live status
getinfo
Send username, machine name and OS
information
Persistence is set in two ways, run registry key or through the startup directory.
Overlap of code usability was found in SideCopy’s Linux-based stager payload of Ares RAT and that of Transparent
Tribe’s Linux-based python malware called Poseidon and other desktop utilities. Here we see similar code overlaps
and possibly sharing of C2 infrastructure between the two groups. AllaKore RAT (open source) has been associated
with SideCopy since its discovery in 2019 along with Action RAT payload. Similarly, Crimson RAT is linked to be an
in-house toolset of APT36.
Infrastructure and Attribution
Looking at the C2, the same target names used previously by APT36 were identified that are running Windows
Server 2012 and 2022 versions.

Based on this correlation and previous attack chains, these campaigns are attributed to both APT36 and SideCopy
groups with high confidence, establishing yet another strong connection between them.
Conclusion
Persistent targeting of the Indian government and defense entities by Pakistan-linked APT groups has continued,
where new operations have emerged with similar threats. SideCopy has deployed its well—associated AllaKore RAT
in multiple campaigns, whereas its parent group, Transparent Tribe (APT36), is continuously using Crimson RAT, T,
making changes to evade detections.
As the threat landscape shifts due to various geopolitical events like the Israel-Iran conflict, India is bound to get
targeted continuously. On the verge of India’s upcoming election, it is suggested that necessary precautions be taken
and that people stay protected amidst the increasing cybercrime.
