EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
S e n t i n e l L a b s  Te a m
•	 China launched an offensive media strategy to push narratives around US hacking 
operations following a joint statement by the US, UK, and EU in July 2021 about 
China’s irresponsible behavior in cyberspace. 
•	 Some PRC cybersecurity companies now coordinate report publication with 
government agencies and state media to amplify their impact.
•	 Allegations of US hacking operations by China lack crucial technical analysis to 
validate their claims. Until 2023, these reports recycled old, leaked US intelligence 
documents. After mid-2023, the PRC dropped pretense of technical validation and 
only released allegations in state media. 
•	 The cyber-focused media campaign preceded the 2023 efforts of the MSS to disclose 
accounts of western spying in the PRC.

IT’S NOT WHAT YOU SAID, IT’S HOW YOU SAID IT.
Since 1963, the Chinese Communist Party has concerned itself with “public opinion warfare”. 
Under its Three Warfares doctrine, which also includes psychological warfare and legal warfare, 
the Party aims to influence the world’s view of China. But it seems the CCP dropped the ball on 
global public opinion on its behavior in cyberspace. For nearly two decades, evidence of Chinese 
industrial espionage captured headlines. Despite this, the facts suggest that China’s leaders were 
unaware of how tarnished their image was until mid-2021. In the winter of that year, a PRC hacking 
team was taking advantage of four vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Servers. When intelligence 
that the company was planning to patch reached the team, they shared the vulnerability with 
others and automated their attack for scale. After years of successful PRC hacking operations, it 
was this scaling that moved governments to action. That is when the U.S., U.K., and the EU jointly 
issued a statement condemning China’s behavior in cyberspace. Only then did China wake up to 
its reputation.
China prefers to engage with countries in a one-on-one, bilateral, way. This approach to diplomatic 
engagement favors China. As a self-described large country, it is easier to negotiate with small 
countries if they do not band together. This is why China refers to its encroachments into Philippine 
waters as a bilateral issue between the two countries. Preferring to frame it this way to cut out 
the Permanent Court of Arbitration and the U.S. So when the EU, UK and US all agreed to sign a 
statement condemning China’s actions in cyberspace, Beijing sat upright.
After the summer of 2021, China’s cybersecurity industry took steps to conceal or defend its 
hacking. In 2023, the Tianfu Cup cybersecurity competition stopped naming the iPhone as one 
its targets. Instead the organizers chose to call it “another country’s phone.” They hoped that the 
oblique reference would conceal the real target. China was trying to limit inflammatory information 
about its hacking capabilities. Besides concealment, Beijing used outright denial, too. When 
Mandiant released its report on UNC4841’s hack of Barracuda products, the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs lashed out. The MFA spokesperson called the report “unprofessional” at a press conference. 
But China did more than simply delete references to US products at its hacking competitions and 
shout down cybersecurity experts. The jointly issued statement so irked Chinese policy leaders 
that they pivoted to offense in the hopes of changing global public opinion.

CHINA’S CYBER REVENGE | WHY THE PRC FAILS TO BACK ITS CLAIMS OF WESTERN ESPIONAGE
BEFORE MES
This review of threat intelligence publications from three prominent cybersecurity firms--Qihoo360, Qi 
An Xin, Antiy--and the China Cybersecurity Industry Alliance, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the National 
Computer Virus Emergency Response Center (CVERC) reveals a distinct pattern of China’s cyber threat 
intelligence and media strategy on US hacking operations.
Between the first reports establishing US involvement in Stuxnet and the summer of 2021, China’s most 
prominent actors in the cybersecurity industry never independently established attribution of hacking 
inside the PRC to any US-affiliated APTs, nor did the analysis of US-nexus hacking extend beyond tools 
and exploits. China’s cybersecurity companies also never published the underlying technical data that is 
considered table stakes for non-Chinese companies. The companies only regurgitated information from 
foreign vendors or leaked US intelligence documents. This was a matter of policy, not capability. Such 
reports were likely written and held back from external publication.
Only after Kaspersky released its threat intelligence on Duqu did Chinese cybersecurity firm Antiy release 
its own analysis of the malware a year later in 2012. Similarly, non-Chinese cybersecurity companies’ 
publications on tools and groups like Regin, Project Sauron, or Equation Group preceded similar reports 
by Chinese cybersecurity firms. PRC cybersecurity companies’ publications were often years behind their 
international peers.

When they did publish, these companies rarely added new analysis. It 
was not until 2017 that Qihoo360 first mentioned the NSA in relation to 
attacks on the PRC. Still, the company did not add new information to 
public discussion, instead pointing to the recently leaked ShadowBrokers 
documents. In a nod to their ability to track but their inability to publish 
technical details of US operations, Qihoo360 claimed to have tracked 
the CIA’s operations tied to tooling disclosed in the Vault7 leaks as far 
back as 2008. At least two major outlets covered the report. But the 
company’s report underscores the problem with the integrity of China’s 
claims. Most of the Qihoo360’s report focused on the Vault7 leaker, as 
well as the structure and purpose of the CIA.
This was the state of affairs until the July 2021 joint statement 
condemned China’s behavior.
CHINA PIVOTS TO REHASHING OLD QUARRELS 
Qi An Xin published the first report in the new year and fired the starting 
gun on China’s new media strategy. The February 2022 report analyzed 
yet another leaked tool of US operators, one disclosed by an intelligence 
leak. This time, however, the company’s report was released alongside 
a slew of state media coverage. Importantly, the coverage included 
a corresponding, English-language article from Global Times–a 
nationalist state media outlet. From then on, a Global Times article has 
accompanied each cyber threat intel publication about US hacking. 
Qihoo360 re-released its March 2020 report claiming US hacked 
unspecified targets in the country just one month later. In March 
2022, the spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced 
Qihoo360’s two-year old report during a press conference. It was 
momentous for the PRC. The coordination marked a new era in 
China’s approach to talking about spying by other nations. The PRC so 
desperately wanted to talk about US hacking that the MFA spokesperson 
dragged out a two-year-old report. 
China’s National Computer Virus Emergency Response Center, a self-
described “national cyber defense agency”, moved quickly to provide 
more content. Immediately following the March press conference, 
CVERC issued a report detailing previously leaked US backdoors and 
tools, like NOPEN. Weeks later in April 2022 CVERC detailed another 
US tool, HIVE. The bevy of reports continued to provide fodder to PRC

state media. A third CVERC piece focused on old, leaked tools was released in June, this one 
delving into ACIDFOX. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs again took care to highlight the ACIDFOX 
reporting at a press conference that month. The shoutout by MFA spokespersons at the press 
conference was another effort to again push US hacking into public discourse. In 2021, Global 
Times had only twice mentioned the NSA–both in the context of railing against global capitalists. 
The publication mentioned the NSA in connection to hackings tools or operations 24 times the 
following year. But it wouldn’t be until late June that the PRC named its first victim of US hacking, a 
notable feature missing from public discourse and one that caught the attention of western press.
CVERC and Qihoo360 jointly released a report in June 2022 claiming the NSA’s Office of Tailored 
Access Operations had penetrated the networks of Northwestern Polytechnical University. 
Although the report was again based on leaked intelligence, it was the first report that identified 
a victim of US hacking in the PRC. It’s unclear why it took so long for any company or state media 
to identify targets of the US. It may be that naming an organization that fell victim to US hacking 
Fig 2: Timeline 2021-2023
8
CHINA’S CYBER REVENGE | WHY THE PRC FAILS TO BACK ITS CLAIMS OF WESTERN ESPIONAGE
is bad politics. In competition between Party factions and aspirational 
leaders, having your organization named as a victim NSA would be an 
undesirable blemish, even if for propaganda purposes. Regardless of 
the reasons such details had been withheld, naming NWPU helped the 
story gain traction.
The authors offered a second lurid detail that foreign press would later 
grab hold of. The last sentence of the report claimed that CVERC and 
Qihoo360 had identified 13 US operators tasked with the mission, 
promising to reveal their identities. To help promulgate the content of 
the report, the State Council Information Office released an English 
language piece on the report, which was quickly picked up by other 
foreign-focused state media. The gambit worked. Western press 
flocked to cover the allegations.
Despite all this, the report still failed to publish verifiable details. The 
authors redacted half of each IP number and the last two digits of 
each calendar date in the report. The first bit of erasure was likely to 
comply with state secrecy laws; the second half to hide that the alleged 
operation would have been more than a decade old at the time of the 
report’s publication.
By now, cybersecurity companies in the PRC were regularly including 
references to US-based APTs in their annual reports—none of which 
offered technical analysis besides what had been leaked in the 
preceding decade. 
China expanded its efforts in 2023. In April of that year, the China 
Cybersecurity Industry Alliance, a group formed in 2016, released 
its Review of Cyberattacks from US Intelligence Agencies. The nearly 
100-page report summarized past publications and intelligence leaks, 
and added no new evidence or allegations. Of the nearly 150 citations 
in the report, less than one-third are attributed to PRC vendors. Still, 
the document provides a tool to those in search of evidence of US 
operations in cyberspace. The report neatly condenses more than a 
decade of disparate research into an easily accessible report. Anyone 
searching for evidence of the US’s malfeasance in cyberspace would 
now have something, in English, at the top of their search results.

CHINA’S CYBER REVENGE | WHY THE PRC FAILS TO BACK ITS CLAIMS OF WESTERN ESPIONAGE
CVERC released a similar report the following month focused on CIA operations and organization 
structure. Again, drawing on leaked intelligence, Empire of Hacking: The U.S. Central Intelligence 
Agency rehashed old Vault7 files and added no new claims or technical evidence for readers. The 
report did, however, claim that the CIA had conducted attacks against targets in the PRC—a still 
new phenomenon following the July 2021 joint statement. Some press picked up on the piece, 
which was even hosted on some Chinese embassies’ websites.
A NEW ERA
In July 2023, China did something it hadn’t done before—it spread new allegations of US hacking 
apparently unrelated to past US intelligence leaks and, as of this report, entirely unsubstantiated. 
In a series of publications by Global Times, the CEO of Antiy claimed the United States had hacked 
into seismic censors of the Wuhan Earthquake Monitoring Center. His claims, along with those of 
the Global Times, were ostensibly based on a report from CVERC and Qihoo360. But this report 
is not yet public, if it exists. Neither CVERC nor Qihoo360 host such a report on their respective 
websites, nor does any PRC government agency. Qihoo360’s only mention of the Wuhan Center is 
a community board post by an anonymous user referencing state media. 
According to Antiy’s CEO, seismic monitoring data would provide US military analysts insights into 
weapons testing happening in Wuhan. The allegations must have tasted sweet in his mouth—years 
earlier, leaked NSA documents identified his company as a collection target.

The lack of technical details–or in this case, a report at all–did not stop 
the story from getting attention. A handful of cybersecurity industry 
outlets in the U.S. picked up the story and ran it in July and August after 
the Global Times published another report covering the allegations. 
This time, state media claimed that “Chinese authorities will publicly 
disclose a highly secretive global reconnaissance system of the US 
government…” Yet another report that has not been released. 
The allegations of US hacking without technical evidence coincided with 
China’s Ministry of State Security launching its public WeChat account. 
Since the middle of 2023, the MSS has published four accounts of 
foreign spies operating in China and being caught. Three are alleged to 
have been working for the U.S., a fourth was alleged to have worked for 
the UK and was tied to office raids of foreign due diligence firms. Off-
the-record American officials confirmed one of the US cases to press 
later in the year. 
CONCLUSION
In both domains of alleged spying, cyber and human, China has not yet 
published detailed accounts that analysts have come to expect from 
cybersecurity firms or western prosecutors’ indictment of foreign spies. 
Accepting this asymmetry in data sharing benefits China, allowing 
the country to publish claims of foreign hacking without the requisite 
information. If analysts do not actively challenge the CCP’s claims, the 
government can lie with impunity. 
Repeating China’s allegations helps the PRC shape global public opinion 
of the U.S. China wants to see the world recognize the U.S. as the 
“empire of hacking.” But outright ignoring China’s claims undermines 
public knowledge and discourse. The fact that China is lodging 
allegations of US espionage operations is still notable, providing 
insight into the relationship between the US and China, even if China 
does not support its claims. CTI analysts and intelligence consumers 
would be wise to differentiate between the claims made by China 
across domains, however. 
1 1
CHINA’S CYBER REVENGE | WHY THE PRC FAILS TO BACK ITS CLAIMS OF WESTERN ESPIONAGE
Human intelligence collection will always be subject to highly secretive practice, prosecution, and 
use. Few governments willingly talk about the operations of hostile nations, much less confirm 
their own operations alleged by foreign intelligence. For allegations of human intelligence, the 
path forward is unlikely to change–it will remain secretive. China will make claims of foreign spying 
without ever releasing public indictments, and those allegations may be periodically confirmed or 
denied by other governments.
But claims of cyber espionage are subject to different standards of integrity and openness. 
Intelligence consumers would be negligent to trust claims of cybersecurity companies that were 
unable to provide technical details supporting their analysis. To date, China has provided no 
reasonable evidence to support any of its claims besides wantonly recycling leaked US intelligence. 
In western cybersecurity industry circles, claims of US hacking without supporting technical 
evidence are derided—and rightfully so. 
State secrecy laws are the likely culprit stopping PRC-based cybersecurity companies from 
publishing technical data. With their hands tied, the CCP’s political mandate to support narratives 
of western espionage operations leaves its companies hamstrung. Analysts should not lower their 
standards to help the PRC achieve its objective of changing global public opinion on Chinese and 
US hacking. Instead, claims made by Chinese firms and the government should be held to the 
same, rigorous analytical standards the global cybersecurity community has self-imposed. As one 
expert said at Labscon 2022 regarding China’s claims of US hacking, “PCAPs or fuck off.”
