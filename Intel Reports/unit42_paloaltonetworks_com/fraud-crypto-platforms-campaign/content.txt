This article describes how threat actors systematically create, promote and potentially profit from these scams, highlighting the techniques used to deceive victims and the potential scale of the operation.\r\n\r\nThe campaign impersonates well-known brands, cryptocurrency platforms and popular organizations to lure victims. The consistent design of the websites and mobile apps suggests the use of a standardized toolkit for developing these platforms at scale.\r\n\r\nThere are several additional indicators attributing these activities to a single threat actor. This is underscored by the consistent registration of domains primarily in Singapore, predominantly using registrars with lenient policies and repeated patterns of fake registrant names. These domains also employ free HTTPS certificates and domain fronting via a popular public cloud service to obscure their true locations.\r\n\r\nThis campaign primarily targets users in East African and Asian countries, with scammers hosting large Telegram channels and groups to engage with victims. The scammers lure users with promises of unrealistically high investment returns and operate similar to Ponzi schemes by encouraging users to recruit others through multi-level affiliate programs.\r\n\r\nPalo Alto Networks customers are better protected from the threats discussed in this article through our Next-Generation Firewall's Advanced WildFire, Advanced URL Filtering and Advanced DNS Security subscriptions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRelated Unit 42 Topics\r\nCryptocurrency, Phishing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScam Crypto Investment Platforms\r\nUnit 42 researchers uncovered a campaign responsible for creating a large number of scam crypto investment platforms, distributed via both websites and mobile apps. This article describes how threat actors systematically create, promote and potentially monetize this campaign of investment scams.\r\nDistribution via Websites and Mobile Apps\r\nEach scam crypto investment platform can be accessed through a website and an Android-based mobile application. A link to the mobile application is posted on the platform's website. Notably, these mobile applications are not published on the mobile app store, likely to evade enforcement and takedown operations.\r\nFraudulent Impersonation\r\nEach scam crypto investment platform uses a popular theme that could be a well-known brand, organization, location or even a trending event. This tactic lures victims into signing up and investing, ultimately leading to fraud.\r\n\r\nOur analysis revealed threat actors mimicking a wide range of brands, including:\r\n\r\n \tWell-known banks\r\n \tRetail stores\r\n \tTechnology companies\r\n \tLuxury brands\r\n \tE-commerce stores\r\n \tCryptocurrency exchanges\r\n\r\nWe identified over 50 impersonated themes across these websites. See Figure 1 for examples. The platforms also leverage major sporting events, like the Paris 2024 Olympics, to attract users. A list of website hostnames is available in the Indicators of Compromise (IoC) section at the end of the article.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_138630\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"700\"] Figure 1. Examples of crypto investment platforms impersonating popular brands, companies and events.[\/caption]\r\nUnrealistic Claims of Returns on Principal Investment\r\nPlatforms lure users with promises of unrealistically high returns on principal investments. Figure 2 shows a screenshot from a platform outlining daily returns on investment. For instance, the \u201cVIP1\u201d package claims to yield a daily return of $3 on an $11 principal investment. This represents a daily return on investment (ROI) of 27% that, when compounded, will yield an annual ROI of at least 2,650%. Such figures are unrealistic and should raise immediate red flags.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_138632\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"500\"] Figure 2. Example of unrealistic claims of return on principal investments.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nSome platforms fabricate explanations of how they generate profits to make these high-return claims appear legitimate. Figure 3 shows an example of a note claiming the creation of an AI-powered smart bot that leverages arbitrage to make money by trading on different crypto marketplaces.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_138634\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"800\"] Figure 3. A note claiming the creation of an AI-powered smart bot that leverages arbitrage to make money by trading on different crypto marketplaces.[\/caption]\r\nSigns of a Ponzi Scheme\r\nEach platform employs a multi-level affiliate program where affiliates earn commissions for signing up new members through an invitation link or code. Figure 4 illustrates an example of this multi-level affiliate program.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_138636\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"500\"] Figure 4. Example of a multi-level affiliate program of a scam crypto investment platform.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nTheir commission structure is tiered. It offers the highest commission for first-level recruits, whom the affiliate signs up directly. The commission decreases for subsequent levels, where the recruited members become affiliates and sign up more members.\r\n\r\nThese characteristics are telltale signs of a pyramid scheme, where members primarily earn money by recruiting others rather than through genuine investments or business activities. We believe that the affiliates leverage social media platforms to promote these schemes, as described next.\r\nPromotions and Distribution Through a Popular Video Sharing Platform\r\nThese scam platforms are promoted on popular video sharing platforms. Figure 5 shows examples of videos promoting a platform 2024olympics-shop[.]com. Each video includes an invitation link or an affiliate code, strongly suggesting the vloggers are top-level affiliates earning commissions through recruitment.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_138638\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1000\"] Figure 5. Search results showing vloggers promoting a scam crypto platform website 2024olympics-shop[.]com on a popular video sharing platform.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nLarge User Base\r\nEach scam investment platform has a potentially large reach. The popularity of these platforms can be gauged by the membership numbers in their associated Telegram channels, many of which boast tens of thousands of members.\r\n\r\nFor example, the Telegram channel shown in Figure 6 had over 29,000 members. This channel is associated with a scam crypto investment platform nmxquantify[.]com.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_138640\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"500\"] Figure 6. An example of a Telegram channel of a scam crypto platform (impersonating Nominex) with more than 29,000 members.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nOur telemetry data indicates that these threat actors primarily target internet users in East African and Asian countries. We supported this with a manual review of videos, where most content creators appeared to target users in these regions.\r\nUse of Scam ToolKit\r\nAnalysis of multiple websites reveals numerous similarities between these platforms, suggesting the use of a single scam toolkit to generate them at scale. This toolkit likely uses basic inputs, such as brand names and images, to produce both a website and a mobile application.\r\n\r\nCommon design elements: The websites share similar layouts. They share several design elements in their placement. For example, each website\u2019s homepage typically features a slideshow at the top, an investment opportunities section and a standard set of buttons linking to company profiles, mobile apps, wallet recharges and money withdrawals.\r\n\r\nUse of a front-end web design framework: Our analysis revealed structural similarities in the websites\u2019 HTML, specifically the common Document Object Model (DOM) element (data-v-*). A known front-end JavaScript framework, Vue.js (discussed in a Stack Overflow thread) commonly uses this element.\r\n\r\nMobile applications: All reviewed mobile applications are Android-based. These apps integrate the original website via a web view, likely to reduce development overhead for the scam toolkit creators.\r\n\r\nThe rationale behind distributing mobile apps remains unclear. These apps, however, require sensitive permissions such as android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE and android.permission.CAMERA. The necessity of these permissions for web view apps is questionable, and while attackers could potentially be misusing them, we found no evidence of such misuse.\r\n\r\nLocation of mobile applications on the website: The mobile applications follow a specific naming convention based on the platform\u2019s website name. For all reviewed platforms, the app\u2019s location follows a specific pattern: api.[name].[tld]\/[name].apk.\r\n\r\nFor example, the application for the platform teslamall66[.]vip is hosted at hxxps[:]\/\/api.teslamall66[.]vip\/teslamall66.apk.\r\n\r\nThese striking similarities in the design of scam crypto websites and their associated mobile apps strongly indicate the use of a toolkit to generate these websites at scale. The next section explores the likelihood of a single threat actor behind these platforms.\r\nIs There a Single Threat Actor Behind This Campaign?\r\nFigure 7 shows increased activity in new domain registrations since June 2024. We estimated the domain registration date based on the first seen passive DNS (historical DNS records), as the WHOIS records for most domains were unavailable at the time of the investigation.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_138642\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1000\"] Figure 7. Number of new domains registered each day between June 6, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2024.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nWe observed that around 15 domains were created on average per day. Further, most of the domains (82%) were registered in Singapore using registrars with relaxed registration requirements. This is evident from the fake registrant names used for registration such as \u201cSophia\u201d (14%), \u201cAbe\u201d (4%) and \u201cSophie\u201d (3%). A steady influx of new domain registrations and repeated use of dummy names suggests automated domain creation.\r\n\r\nThe threat actor also registered a few domains through reputable, well-known registrars, using paid privacy services to mask the registrants\u2019 names.\r\n\r\nLike many malicious websites, these scam crypto websites use free HTTPS certificates (digital credentials that encrypt website traffic).\r\n\r\nThe campaign heavily used domain fronting, a technique masking the true destination of web traffic, through public cloud services (97% of the hosting IP addresses belong to a single cloud service provider). In some cases, we identified the real hosting IP addresses for some of the domains. Even those real hosting IP addresses were abusing popular shared hosting platforms. This allows them to further camouflage their operations by being among unrelated benign domains hosted on these shared IP addresses. However, our analysis showed highly interconnected malicious domains and these shared hosting IP addresses, suggesting a coordinated attack.\r\n\r\nThe following points suggest that a single threat actor created the domains involved in this campaign:\r\n\r\n \tSimilar registration records\r\n \tConsistent domain creation over time\r\n \tSimilar TLS certificates\r\n \tSimilar hosting infrastructure\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nThis article detailed a widespread scam cryptocurrency investment campaign, which operates similarly to Ponzi schemes. They impersonate popular and reputable brands, organizations and events to lure victims. In 2024, we uncovered thousands of websites associated with this campaign.\r\n\r\nWe found strong evidence that suggests a single threat actor likely operates these websites, given the consistent registration patterns and the use of similar infrastructure. This actor may also be using a sophisticated toolkit to create these fraudulent sites at scale since both the websites and mobile apps involved share common design elements and functionalities.\r\n\r\nWe hope that the details of the scam crypto investment campaign described in our article can help readers identify similar fraudulent schemes. We strongly advise readers to always conduct thorough research before investing, to safeguard against such scams. Be particularly cautious of unrealistic promises of guaranteed returns, as these are often major red flags for scam investment schemes.\r\n\r\nPalo Alto Networks customers are better protected from the threats discussed in this article through our Next-Generation Firewall's Advanced WildFire, Advanced URL Filtering and Advanced DNS Security subscriptions.\r\n\r\nIf you think you may have been compromised or have an urgent matter, get in touch with the Unit 42 Incident Response team or call:\r\n\r\n \tNorth America: Toll Free: +1 (866) 486-4842 (866.4.UNIT42)\r\n \tUK: +44.20.3743.3660\r\n \tEurope and Middle East: +31.20.299.3130\r\n \tAsia: +65.6983.8730\r\n \tJapan: +81.50.1790.0200\r\n \tAustralia: +61.2.4062.7950\r\n \tIndia: 00080005045107\r\n\r\nPalo Alto Networks has shared these findings with our fellow Cyber Threat Alliance (CTA) members.

                <h2><a id="post-138627-_4lt92rr5muov"></a>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>Unit 42 researchers discovered a campaign distributing thousands of fraudulent cryptocurrency investment platforms ​​via websites and mobile applications. This article describes how threat actors systematically create, promote and potentially profit from these scams, highlighting the techniques used to deceive victims and the potential scale of the operation.</p>
<p>The campaign impersonates well-known brands, cryptocurrency platforms and popular organizations to lure victims. The consistent design of the websites and mobile apps suggests the use of a standardized toolkit for developing these platforms at scale.</p>
<p>There are several additional indicators attributing these activities to a single threat actor. This is underscored by the consistent registration of domains primarily in Singapore, predominantly using registrars with lenient policies and repeated patterns of fake registrant names. These domains also employ free HTTPS certificates and domain fronting via a popular public cloud service to obscure their true locations.</p>
<p>This campaign primarily targets users in East African and Asian countries, with scammers hosting large Telegram channels and groups to engage with victims. The scammers lure users with promises of unrealistically high investment returns and operate similar to Ponzi schemes by encouraging users to recruit others through multi-level affiliate programs.</p>

<h2><a id="post-138627-_zbt6pvxwgj03"></a>Scam Crypto Investment Platforms</h2>
<p>Unit 42 researchers uncovered a campaign responsible for creating a large number of scam crypto investment platforms, distributed via both websites and mobile apps. This article describes how threat actors systematically create, promote and potentially monetize this campaign of investment scams.</p>
<h3><a id="post-138627-_decw6aw0s56q"></a>Distribution via Websites and Mobile Apps</h3>
<p>Each scam crypto investment platform can be accessed through a website and an Android-based mobile application. A link to the mobile application is posted on the platform's website. Notably, these mobile applications are not published on the mobile app store, likely to evade enforcement and takedown operations.</p>
<h3><a id="post-138627-_yr0obuczxfvy"></a>Fraudulent Impersonation</h3>
<p>Each scam crypto investment platform uses a popular theme that could be a well-known brand, organization, location or even a trending event. This tactic lures victims into signing up and investing, ultimately leading to fraud.</p>
<p>Our analysis revealed threat actors mimicking a wide range of brands, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Well-known banks</li>
<li>Retail stores</li>
<li>Technology companies</li>
<li>Luxury brands</li>
<li>E-commerce stores</li>
<li>Cryptocurrency exchanges</li>
</ul>
<p>We identified over 50 impersonated themes across these websites. See Figure 1 for examples. The platforms also leverage major sporting events, like the Paris 2024 Olympics, to attract users. A list of website hostnames is available in the <a href="#post-138627-_v8176g40kstn">Indicators of Compromise (IoC) section</a> at the end of the article.</p>
<figure id="attachment_138630" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-138630" style="width: 700px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img  class="wp-image-138630 lozad"  data-src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/word-image-559244-138627-1.png" alt="Screenshots of various mobile applications including a spoof Olympics Shop app, and apps with multiple financial tracking and transaction interfaces." width="700" height="1122" data-srcset="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/word-image-559244-138627-1.png 1278w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/word-image-559244-138627-1-275x440.png 275w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/word-image-559244-138627-1-437x700.png 437w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/word-image-559244-138627-1-768x1231.png 768w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/word-image-559244-138627-1-959x1536.png 959w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-138630" class="wp-caption-text">Figure 1.

<h3><a id="post-138627-_7i5ieabofuf2"></a>Unrealistic Claims of Returns on Principal Investment</h3>
<p>Platforms lure users with promises of unrealistically high returns on principal investments. Figure 2 shows a screenshot from a platform outlining daily returns on investment. For instance, the “VIP1” package claims to yield a daily return of $3 on an $11 principal investment. This represents a daily return on investment (ROI) of 27% that, when compounded, will yield an annual ROI of at least 2,650%. Such figures are unrealistic and should raise immediate red flags.</p>
<figure id="attachment_138632" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-138632" style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img  class="wp-image-138632 lozad"  data-src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/word-image-564841-138627-2.png" alt="A list detailing accumulated stored values and daily incomes associated with different VIP levels.

Example of unrealistic claims of return on principal investments.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Some platforms fabricate explanations of how they generate profits to make these high-return claims appear legitimate. Figure 3 shows an example of a note claiming the creation of an AI-powered smart bot that leverages arbitrage to make money by trading on different crypto marketplaces.</p>
<figure id="attachment_138634" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-138634" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img  class="wp-image-138634 lozad"  data-src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/word-image-568276-138627-3.png" alt="Introduction document discussing arbitrage opportunities, market efficiencies, and the role of technology in trading.

<h3><a id="post-138627-_u2zsin2hvgbj"></a>Signs of a Ponzi Scheme</h3>
<p>Each platform employs a multi-level affiliate program where affiliates earn commissions for signing up new members through an invitation link or code. Figure 4 illustrates an example of this multi-level affiliate program.</p>
<figure id="attachment_138636" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-138636" style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img  class="wp-image-138636 lozad"  data-src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/word-image-573407-138627-4.png" alt="Screenshot of system notification for a digital rewards and referral program.

Example of a multi-level affiliate program of a scam crypto investment platform.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Their commission structure is tiered. It offers the highest commission for first-level recruits, whom the affiliate signs up directly. The commission decreases for subsequent levels, where the recruited members become affiliates and sign up more members.</p>
<p>These characteristics are telltale signs of a pyramid scheme, where members primarily earn money by recruiting others rather than through genuine investments or business activities. We believe that the affiliates leverage social media platforms to promote these schemes, as described next.</p>
<h3><a id="post-138627-_ozzjomrvn6wi"></a>Promotions and Distribution Through a Popular Video Sharing Platform</h3>
<p>These scam platforms are promoted on popular video sharing platforms. Figure 5 shows examples of videos promoting a platform <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">2024olympics-shop[.]com</span>. Each video includes an invitation link or an affiliate code, strongly suggesting the vloggers are top-level affiliates earning commissions through recruitment.</p>

<h3><a id="post-138627-_547jp28jt5wv"></a><br />
Large User Base</h3>
<p>Each scam investment platform has a potentially large reach. The popularity of these platforms can be gauged by the membership numbers in their associated Telegram channels, many of which boast tens of thousands of members.</p>
<p>For example, the Telegram channel shown in Figure 6 had over 29,000 members. This channel is associated with a scam crypto investment platform <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">nmxquantify[.]com</span>.</p>

<p>Our telemetry data indicates that these threat actors primarily target internet users in East African and Asian countries. We supported this with a manual review of videos, where most content creators appeared to target users in these regions.</p>
<h2><a id="post-138627-_pxn3apjh166e"></a>Use of Scam ToolKit</h2>
<p>Analysis of multiple websites reveals numerous similarities between these platforms, suggesting the use of a single scam toolkit to generate them at scale. This toolkit likely uses basic inputs, such as brand names and images, to produce both a website and a mobile application.</p>
<p><strong>Common design elements: </strong>The websites share similar layouts. They share several design elements in their placement. For example, each website’s homepage typically features a slideshow at the top, an investment opportunities section and a standard set of buttons linking to company profiles, mobile apps, wallet recharges and money withdrawals.</p>
<p><strong>Use of a front-end web design framework:</strong> Our analysis revealed structural similarities in the websites’ HTML, specifically the common Document Object Model (DOM) element (<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">data-v-*</span>). A known front-end JavaScript framework, <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">Vue.js</span> (discussed in a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42701312/random-data-v-attribute-in-vue-js-components" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stack Overflow thread</a>) commonly uses this element.</p>
<p><strong>Mobile applications:</strong> All reviewed mobile applications are Android-based. These apps integrate the original website via a web view, likely to reduce development overhead for the scam toolkit creators.</p>
<p>The rationale behind distributing mobile apps remains unclear. These apps, however, require sensitive permissions such as <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</span> and <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">android.permission.CAMERA</span>. The necessity of these permissions for web view apps is questionable, and while attackers could potentially be misusing them, we found no evidence of such misuse.</p>
<p><strong>Location of mobile applications on the website</strong>: The mobile applications follow a specific naming convention based on the platform’s website name. For all reviewed platforms, the app’s location follows a specific pattern: <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">api.[name].[tld]/[name].apk</span>.</p>
<p>For example, the application for the platform <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">teslamall66[.]vip</span> is hosted at <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">hxxps[:]//api.teslamall66[.]vip/teslamall66.apk</span>.</p>
<p>These striking similarities in the design of scam crypto websites and their associated mobile apps strongly indicate the use of a toolkit to generate these websites at scale. The next section explores the likelihood of a single threat actor behind these platforms.</p>
<h2><a id="post-138627-_uf52oohah31b"></a>Is There a Single Threat Actor Behind This Campaign?</h2>
<p>Figure 7 shows increased activity in new domain registrations since June 2024. We estimated the domain registration date based on the first seen passive DNS (historical DNS records), as the WHOIS records for most domains were unavailable at the time of the investigation.</p>
<figure id="attachment_138642" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-138642" style="width: 1000px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img  class="wp-image-138642 lozad"  data-src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chart-4.png" alt="Line graph displaying the number of domains registered over time from June to December 2024. Palo Alto Networks and Unit 42 logo lockup. " width="1000" height="538" data-srcset="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chart-4.png 2048w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chart-4-786x423.png 786w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chart-4-1302x700.png 1302w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chart-4-768x413.png 768w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chart-4-1536x826.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-138642" class="wp-caption-text">Figure 7. Number of new domains registered each day between June 6, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2024.</figcaption></figure>
<p>We observed that around 15 domains were created on average per day. Further, most of the domains (82%) were registered in Singapore using registrars with relaxed registration requirements. This is evident from the fake registrant names used for registration such as “Sophia” (14%), “Abe” (4%) and “Sophie” (3%). A steady influx of new domain registrations and repeated use of dummy names suggests automated domain creation.</p>
<p>The threat actor also registered a few domains through reputable, well-known registrars, using paid privacy services to mask the registrants’ names.</p>
<p>Like many malicious websites, these scam crypto websites use free HTTPS certificates (digital credentials that encrypt website traffic).</p>
<p>The campaign heavily used domain fronting, a technique masking the true destination of web traffic, through public cloud services (97% of the hosting IP addresses belong to a single cloud service provider). In some cases, we identified the real hosting IP addresses for some of the domains. Even those real hosting IP addresses were abusing popular shared hosting platforms. This allows them to further camouflage their operations by being among unrelated benign domains hosted on these shared IP addresses. However, our analysis showed highly interconnected malicious domains and these shared hosting IP addresses, suggesting a coordinated attack.</p>
<p>The following points suggest that a single threat actor created the domains involved in this campaign:</p>
<ul>
<li>Similar registration records</li>
<li>Consistent domain creation over time</li>
<li>Similar TLS certificates</li>
<li>Similar hosting infrastructure</li>
</ul>
<h2><a id="post-138627-_x6yux8evx4q0"></a>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This article detailed a widespread scam cryptocurrency investment campaign, which operates similarly to Ponzi schemes. They impersonate popular and reputable brands, organizations and events to lure victims. In 2024, we uncovered thousands of websites associated with this campaign.</p>
<p>We found strong evidence that suggests a single threat actor likely operates these websites, given the consistent registration patterns and the use of similar infrastructure. This actor may also be using a sophisticated toolkit to create these fraudulent sites at scale since both the websites and mobile apps involved share common design elements and functionalities.</p>
<p>We hope that the details of the scam crypto investment campaign described in our article can help readers identify similar fraudulent schemes. We strongly advise readers to always conduct thorough research before investing, to safeguard against such scams. Be particularly cautious of unrealistic promises of guaranteed returns, as these are often major red flags for scam investment schemes.</p>
