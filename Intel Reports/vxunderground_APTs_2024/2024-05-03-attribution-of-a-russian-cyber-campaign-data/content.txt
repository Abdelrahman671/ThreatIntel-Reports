Attribution of a Russian cyber campaign 
The Federal Government condemns in the strongest possible terms – and with the support 
of the European Union, NATO and international partners – the campaign by the 
state-sponsored cyber actor APT28 that targeted the Executive Committee of the Social 
Democratic Party of Germany. 
The Federal Government’s national attribution procedure regarding this campaign has 
concluded that, for a relatively long period, the cyber actor APT28 used a critical 
vulnerability in Microsoft Outlook that remained unidentified at the time to compromise 
numerous email accounts. 
Based on reliable information provided by our intelligence services, the actor APT28 has 
been attributed to the Russian Federation, and more specifically to the Russian military 
intelligence service GRU. 
What is more, this actor’s campaign also targeted various government authorities and 
companies in the spheres of logistics, armaments, the air and space industry, and IT services, 
as well as foundations and associations. It was directed at entities in Germany, other 
European countries and targets in Ukraine. 
APT28 is also responsible for the cyber attack that was perpetrated on the German 
Bundestag in 2015.  
Such irresponsible actions in cyberspace contravene international cyber norms and deserve 
special attention, especially in a year in which many countries are holding elections.  
Cyber attacks against political parties, state institutions and companies that provide critical 
infrastructure pose a threat to our democracy, our national security and our liberal-minded 
society.  
The Federal Government most strongly condemns the repeated and unacceptable malicious 
cyber activities by state-sponsored Russian actors and again calls on Russia to refrain from 
such behaviour. Germany is determined to work together with its European and 
international partners to counter such malicious cyber activities.
