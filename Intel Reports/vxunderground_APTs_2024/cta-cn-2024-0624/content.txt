Chinese State-Sponsored RedJuliett 
Intensifies Taiwanese Cyber Espionage 
via Network Perimeter Exploitation
RedJuliett targeted government, 
university, technology, and 
diplomacy sectors in Taiwan and 
likely compromised entities in Hong 
Kong, South Korea, Laos, the United 
States, Rwanda, Kenya, and Djibouti.
Internet-facing devices such as 
firewalls, load balancers, and 
enterprise VPNs were targeted for 
initial access. SQL injection and 
directory traversal was attempted 
against web and SQL applications.
RedJuliett likely operates from 
Fuzhou, Fujian province, China. 
The group used SoftEther VPN to 
administer operational infrastructure 
from suspected source range 
infrastructure geolocating to Fuzhou.

Executive Summary
Between November 2023 and April 2024, Insikt Group identified cyber-espionage activity 
predominantly targeting government, education, technology, and diplomatic organizations in Taiwan, 
conducted by a likely Chinese state-sponsored threat activity group we track as RedJuliett.  While this 
1
focus on Taiwan aligns with the group’s past activity, we also observed wider targeting against entities 
in Hong Kong, Malaysia, Laos, the Philippines, South Korea, Kenya, Rwanda, Djibouti, and the United 
States.
Insikt Group identified 24 suspected victim organizations communicating with RedJuliett servers via a 
SoftEther bridge, including government organizations in Taiwan, Laos, Kenya, and Rwanda. RedJuliett 
also conducted network reconnaissance or attempted exploitation against over 70 Taiwanese 
organizations in the academic, government, think tank, and technology sectors, as well as multiple de 
facto embassies. The group targets internet-facing appliances such as firewalls, load balancers, and 
enterprise virtual private network (VPN) products for initial access, as well as attempting structured 
query language (SQL) injection and directory traversal exploits against web and SQL applications. In 
some cases, we identified RedJuliett conducting post-exploitation activity using open-source web 
shells and exploiting a known elevation of privilege vulnerability in the Linux operating system. 
Additionally, RedJuliett used SoftEther to administer operational infrastructure consisting of both threat 
actor-controlled servers leased from virtual private server (VPS) providers and compromised 
infrastructure belonging to three Taiwanese universities.
Insikt Group assesses that RedJuliett likely operates out of Fuzhou, Fujian province, China, given that 
multiple RedJuliett SoftEther nodes have been consistently administered from IP addresses that 
geolocate to Fuzhou. This operating location aligns with the group’s persistent targeting of Taiwan. 
Given the close geographical proximity between Fuzhou and Taiwan, Chinese intelligence services 
operating in Fuzhou are likely tasked with intelligence collection against Taiwanese targets.
RedJuliett is likely targeting Taiwan to collect intelligence and support Beijing’s policy-making on 
cross-strait relations. RedJuliett displayed an interest in targeting critical technology companies, which 
aligns with previous public reporting. Targeting patterns also suggest that RedJuliett is likely interested 
in collecting intelligence on Taiwan’s economic policy and trade and diplomatic relations with other 
countries. RedJuliett, like many other Chinese threat actors, is likely targeting vulnerabilities in 
internet-facing devices because these devices have limited visibility and security solutions available, 
and targeting them has proven to be an effective way to scale initial access.
Due to a focus on exploiting known vulnerabilities in public-facing devices and applications, 
organizations likely to be targeted by RedJuliett should complement routine vulnerability patching with 
1 RedJuliett closely overlaps with public reporting under the aliases Flax Typhoon (Microsoft) and Ethereal Panda (CrowdStrike).

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS
additional defense-in-depth strategies. These strategies should emphasize detecting post-exploitation 
persistence, discovery, and lateral movement activities. Organizations should also regularly audit 
internet-facing and perimeter appliances and reduce attack surfaces by disabling interfaces or portals 
where not required. Many public-facing appliances have limited visibility, logging capabilities, and 
support for traditional security solutions; organizations should consider these factors when initially 
procuring network appliances to better detect and respond to threats.
Unless the security of internet-facing devices is improved or organizations take steps to move away 
from vulnerable edges, Chinese state-sponsored threat actors will almost certainly continue to exploit 
these devices. As Taiwan faces ongoing sovereignty threats from the People’s Republic of China (PRC) 
while simultaneously serving as a critical global technology and manufacturing hub, RedJuliett will 
almost certainly continue to conduct high-tempo cyber-espionage operations with a focus on 
Taiwanese technology, government, educational, and think tank organizations.
Key Findings
●
RedJuliett has likely compromised organizations in Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Laos, the 
United States, Rwanda, Kenya, and Djibouti.
●
Additionally, RedJuliett has conducted vulnerability scanning or attempted exploitation against 
de facto embassies, Taiwanese universities, government entities, think tanks focused on 
Taiwanese economic policy, aerospace companies, electronics manufacturers, computing 
industry associations, and more.
●
RedJuliett was observed administering multiple SoftEther nodes from suspected source-range 
infrastructure geolocating to Fuzhou, Fujian province, China.
●
Insikt Group anticipates that Chinese state-sponsored groups will continue to target Taiwanese 
government agencies, universities, and critical technology companies. We also anticipate that 
RedJuliett will continue to focus on exploiting public-facing devices, as these have limited 
visibility, logging capabilities, and support for traditional security solutions.
Background
As first reported by Microsoft in August 2023, Flax Typhoon (RedJuliett) has been observed primarily 
targeting organizations in Taiwan using living-off-the-land (LotL) techniques and the open-source VPN 
software SoftEther. The group has been active since mid-2021 and has targeted government agencies, 
education, critical manufacturing, and IT organizations in Taiwan. To gain initial access to Taiwanese 
networks, Flax Typhoon exploited vulnerabilities in public-facing services, such as VPN, web, and SQL 
applications. The group then used the China Chopper web shell on compromised servers to establish 
persistence and remotely execute code. Following initial access, the group relied on open-source tools, 
such as JuicyPotato and BadPotato, and LotL techniques. CrowdStrike reporting on Ethereal Panda 
notes very similar tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and the group’s use of the open-source 
web shell Godzilla.

RedJuliett SoftEther Infrastructure
In August 2023, Microsoft highlighted multiple self-signed transport layer security (TLS) certificates 
used in Flax Typhoon (RedJuliett) activity targeting Taiwan, which were all generated through the 
open-source client and server VPN software SoftEther (see Table 1). Insikt Group has observed 
RedJuliett continuing to reuse these certificates, allowing us to identify multiple new RedJuliett servers, 
including three likely compromised Taiwanese universities that served the TLS certificates.

Insikt Group also previously observed known RedJuliett SoftEther TLS certificates on servers 
associated with three Taiwanese universities. We have not observed evidence to confirm whether these 
entities were end targets of RedJuliett activity or were being used to facilitate further targeting of 
entities within Taiwan. However, observed scanning of additional Taiwanese universities and historical 
industry reporting further supports the group’s interest in Taiwanese organizations within the education 
sector.

Likely RedJuliett Victim Organizations Communicating with Threat 
Actor-Controlled SoftEther Servers
In early 2024, Insikt Group identified 24 suspected victim organizations regularly communicating to a 
RedJuliett SoftEther VPN server. This communication indicates that a SoftEther VPN bridge or client is 
running within these victim networks, which aligns with historical public reporting on RedJuliett activity. 
Victimology mainly consisted of government, education, and religious organizations, as well as software 
companies (see Figure 3). Approximately 60% of identified victim organizations were in Taiwan, with 
others in Hong Kong, South Korea, Laos, the United States, Rwanda, Kenya, and Djibouti.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS
RedJuliett compromised government organizations in Taiwan, Laos, Kenya, and Rwanda. The group also 
targeted the technology industry in Taiwan, including an optoelectronics company, a large Taiwanese 
facial recognition company that has held contracts with the Taiwanese government, and four software 
companies. Multiple universities were also compromised, including three Taiwanese universities, an 
American university, and a Djiboutian university. The group also targeted religious organizations in 
Taiwan, Hong Kong, and South Korea. Additionally, RedJuliett compromised a geological engineering 
company in Hong Kong, a Taiwanese waste and pollution treatment company, and a Taiwanese 
publishing house.

RedJuliett Targets Internet-Facing Web Servers and Appliances
Using Recorded Future® Network Intelligence, Insikt Group observed RedJuliett using dedicated threat 
actor-controlled SoftEther VPN servers to conduct reconnaissance and attempted exploitation activity 
targeting a wide range of predominantly Taiwanese organizations from November 2023 to April 2024. In 
addition to acting as SoftEther VPN nodes, multiple RedJuliett IP addresses have been concurrently 
configured as Acunetix Web Application Security Scanners. Insikt Group has regularly observed 
vulnerability scanning and exploitation activity from these servers targeting web servers associated

with multiple Taiwanese organizations, predominantly in the government, education, and technology 
sectors.
Most recently, Insikt Group observed RedJuliett attempt SQL injection, directory traversal, and other 
exploits targeting web applications of target entities in multiple cases. In a small number of cases, we 
observed the group conduct post-exploitation activity using the open-source web shells devilzShell and 
AntSword and exploiting the Linux elevation of privilege vulnerability DirtyCow (CVE-2016-5195).
Insikt Group also observed the group display an interest in probing internet-facing F5 BIG-IP and 
Fortinet FortiGate devices, both of which are commonly exploited for initial access by a range of 
Chinese state-sponsored groups. In multiple cases in late 2023, we also observed RedJuliett 
communicating with ZyXEL ZyWALL firewall devices located within Taiwan. While Insikt Group is unable 
to confirm the nature of these communications, we note recent reporting from TeamT5 detailing 
suspected Chinese threat actors exploiting two vulnerabilities in ZyXEL ZyWALL devices in Taiwan since 
at least July 2023, likely for use as operational infrastructure in follow-on intrusion activity.
Targets of RedJuliett Reconnaissance or Attempted Exploitation Activity
Between December 2023 and April 2024, Insikt Group observed RedJuliett reconnaissance or 
attempted exploitation activity targeting at least 75 organizations, predominantly in Taiwan and across 
the government, education, and technology sectors (see Figure 4 for a full breakdown of targeting by 
sector). While we observed RedJuliett likely attempting to target all of these organizations, we could 
only confirm post-exploitation activity in a small number of cases.
Within Taiwan, we observed RedJuliett heavily target the technology industry, including organizations in 
critical technology fields. RedJuliett conducted vulnerability scanning or attempted exploitation against 
a semiconductor company and two Taiwanese aerospace companies that have contracts with the 
Taiwanese military. The group also targeted eight electronics manufacturers, two universities focused 
on technology, an industrial embedded systems company, a technology-focused research and 
development institute, and seven computing industry associations.
RedJuliett also displayed an interest in Taiwan’s economic and trade policy and international affairs. The 
group targeted three de facto embassies from South and Southeast Asian countries, two government 
departments focused on economic policy, two think tanks conducting research on Taiwanese economic 
policy, and a trade promotion organization. Additionally, RedJuliett conducted scanning or attempted 
exploitation against infrastructure associated with a multinational logistics company and two airlines. 
RedJuliett also targeted civil society, including two media organizations, a charity, and a 
non-governmental organization (NGO) focused on human rights. Insikt Group observed RedJuliett 
target eight universities and eleven government entities in total.
RedJuliett also conducted reconnaissance scanning or attempted exploitation of four organizations 
outside of Taiwan, including two government organizations in the Philippines, a government department 
in Djibouti, and a Malaysian airline.

Suspected Source Range Administration Activity from Fuzhou, Fujian Province
Using Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group observed suspected administration activity 
from Chinanet IP addresses geolocating to Fuzhou, Fujian province, to multiple RedJuliett SoftEther 
servers. This traffic was consistent with established SoftEther VPN connections and interaction with an 
internet-exposed Acunetix login panel. While RedJuliett’s potential affiliation with either China’s Ministry 
of State Security (MSS) or People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is currently unknown, an operating location 
within Fuzhou is consistent with the group’s persistent focus on Taiwan. Regional specialization has 
been observed in the operations of both civilian and military intelligence organizations in China. Fuzhou 
falls within the PLA Eastern Theater Command, which heavily focuses on targeting Taiwan.

Mitigations
We recommend that users conduct the following measures to detect and mitigate observed TTPs 
associated with RedJuliett activity: 
●
Ensure a risk-based approach for patching vulnerabilities, prioritizing high-risk vulnerabilities and 
those being exploited in the wild as determined through the Recorded Future Vulnerability 
Intelligence module. Regarding Chinese state-sponsored groups, prioritize addressing remote 
code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities in popular VPN, mail server, firewall, and load-balancing 
appliances. Pay particular attention to F5 BIG-IP, Fortinet FortiGate, and ZyXEL ZyWALL devices, 
as they were targeted by RedJuliett.
●
Recorded Future Third-Party Intelligence module users can monitor real-time output to identify 
suspected targeted intrusion activity involving key vendors and partners within physical, 
network, and software supply chains.
●
By monitoring Malicious Traffic Analysis (MTA), Recorded Future clients can alert on and 
proactively monitor infrastructure that may be involved in notable communication to known 
RedJuliett command-and-control (C2) IP addresses.
●
Install the Recorded Future® Threat Intelligence Browser Extension to get instant access to 
threat intelligence from any web-based resource. This extension enables users to process alerts 
faster within their security information and event management (SIEM) and prioritize 
vulnerabilities for patching.
●
Ensure security monitoring and detection capabilities are in place for all external-facing services 
and devices. Monitor for follow-on activity likely to occur following exploitation of these 
external-facing services, such as the deployment of web shells, backdoors, or reverse shells and 
subsequent lateral movement to internal networks.
●
Practice network segmentation, such as isolating internet-facing services in a network 
demilitarized zone (DMZ).
●
Review public guidance on mitigating common TTPs used by Chinese state-sponsored groups (1, 
2, 3, 4). Review Insikt Group’s report Charting China’s Climb as a Leading Global Cyber Power for 
trends and recommendations for mitigating Chinese advanced persistent threat (APT) activity 
more broadly.
Outlook
Insikt Group anticipates that RedJuliett and other Chinese state-sponsored threat actors will continue 
to target Taiwan for intelligence-gathering at a high operational tempo, focusing on universities, 
government departments, think tanks, and technology companies. We also anticipate that Chinese 
state-sponsored groups will continue to focus on conducting reconnaissance against and exploiting 
public-facing devices, as this has proved a successful tactic in scaling initial access against a wide 
range of global targets.
