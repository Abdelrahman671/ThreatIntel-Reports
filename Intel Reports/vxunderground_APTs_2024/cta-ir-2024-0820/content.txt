GreenCharlie Infrastructure Linked to 
US Political Campaign Targeting
Insikt Group has discovered a cluster 
of malicious network infrastructure 
used by Iran-backed GreenCharlie, 
which is reportedly linked to malware 
used in the recent targeting of US 
political campaigns.
GreenCharlie’s victimology includes 
research and policy analysts, 
government officials, diplomats, 
and high-value strategic targets.
GreenCharlie highly likely operates at 
the behest of the Islamic Revolutionary 
Guard Corps’ Intelligence Organization 
(IRGC-IO), and has overlaps with Mint 
Sandstorm, Charming Kitten, and TA453.

Executive Summary
In August 2024, open sources revealed that US political campaign officials and affiliates were targeted
as part of Mint Sandstorm and APT42 operations. In this report, we discuss threat activity associated
with the Iran-nexus group we track as GreenCharlie, which overlaps with Mint Sandstorm, Charming
Kitten, and TA453. Recorded Future has tracked Iran-linked GreenCharlie activity and malicious
infrastructure since 2020. Our global Network Intelligence capability has allowed us to identify and
track a large and rapidly evolving cluster of infrastructure used to support GreenCharlie
cyber-espionage campaigns. Now, we have been able to link this network to the recent targeting of US
political campaigns.
GreenCharlie is associated (1, 2) with malware such as POWERSTAR (also known as CharmPower and
GorjolEcho) and NokNok, which is used with targeted spearphishing operations. A report issued by
Google-Mandiant (TAG) on August 14, 2024, included hashes for a malware sample it calls GORBLE,
which uses GreenCharlie infrastructure for command-and-control (C2). Insikt Group analyzed GORBLE,
POWERSTAR, and TAMECAT (a malware associated with APT42 by Google-Mandiant), and determined
they are all variants of the same malware family. We note that Insikt Group tracks infrastructure that
overlaps with APT42 as GreenBravo.
Throughout July and August 2024, Insikt Group used Recorded Future Network Intelligence to identify
various Iran-based IP addresses that communicated with GreenCharlie infrastructure. This
infrastructure was likely used for phishing activity, including potentially for testing and training.
Additionally, it is highly likely that the threat actors used ProtonVPN and/or ProtonMail to enable their
operations.
GreenCharlie used multiple dynamic DNS (DDNS) providers to register its infrastructure (as depicted in
Appendix A). These providers include Dynu, DNSEXIT, and Vitalwerks. Furthermore, consistent with its
known tradecraft, the group also abused the Namecheap provider to register various other domains that
are part of the cluster Insikt Group has tracked since June 2024.
Key Findings
●
From May 2024 onward, GreenCharlie registered a large number of dynamic DNS (DDNS)
domains that have highly likely been used for targeted social engineering and phishing
operations.
●
Insikt Group has established a direct infrastructure link between GreenCharlie clusters and
malware referred to in open sources as GORBLE, which is reportedly linked to the targeting of US
political candidates.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS
●
Analysis of Recorded Future Network Intelligence indicates that GreenCharlie threat actors likely
used ProtonVPN or ProtonMail to enable their operations.
●
Iranian IP addresses were identified communicating with GreenCharlie infrastructure, which is
likely part of the operation’s spearphishing component.
●
GreenCharlie’s victimology includes research and policy analysts, government officials,
diplomats, and high-value strategic targets. While Insikt Group has not identified direct evidence
of the targeting of US government and political campaign officials, open-source reporting has
enabled us to establish a credible link.
●
GreenCharlie highly likely operates at the behest of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps
(IRGC); due to its persistent and strategic remit, it is also likely to be associated with the
Intelligence Organization of the IRGC (IRGC-IO).

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS
Threat Analysis
Infrastructure Analysis
GreenCharlie infrastructure detections enable progressive tracking of threat activity believed to overlap
with infrastructure used to deliver malware such as POWERSTAR, NokNok, and GorjolEcho, in addition
to enabling social engineering and phishing attacks. Since May 2024, we observed the group register
multiple dynamic DNS (DDNS) domains using a variety of providers that include Dynu, DNSEXIT,
Vitalwerks, Cloud DNS, FreeDNS, and Dia Systems. GreenCharlie hosted most of the identified
infrastructure in small clusters. However, in specific circumstances, domains uniquely resolved to IP
addresses owned by different infrastructure providers. The majority of the infrastructure identified as
part of this research was hosted on Scalaxy B.V. (AS58061) infrastructure. We also identified
GreenCharlie infrastructure that used the OVHcloud (AS16276), Worldstream, NL (AS49981), M247
(AS9009), and Podaon SIA (AS211381) providers for hosting.
Insikt Group has continued to track GreenCharlie threat clusters since we last reported on the threat
group in May 2024. We observed that GreenCharlie continues to register infrastructure via the
Namecheap registrar (much of which is highly likely active) using themes that overlap with cloud
platforms, file sharing services, document visualization services, video conferencing, and
authentication-themed domains. These include domains that use terms like “cloud”, “uptimezone”,
“doceditor”, ”joincloud”, and “pageviewer”, among others.
GreenCharlie uses a multitude of top-level domains (TLDs) for domain registration. In the past we have
detected .xyz, .icu, .network, .online, and .site domain clusters registered by the group. As it pertains to
the cluster in this report, the majority were registered using the .info TLD. According to Recorded Future
datasets, as well as DomainTools, GreenCharlie threat actors used WHOIS privacy protection to
obfuscate registration details.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS
Figure 1: Link analysis between DDNS domains revealed a direct relationship via TLS certificates and reliance on the same
infrastructure provider (Source: Recorded Future)
As depicted in Figure 1, many of the DDNS domains identified as part of the research also shared TLS
certificates with other domains connected to the same cluster. As of this writing, the overwhelming
majority were issued Let’s Encrypt certificates throughout the June, July, and August 2024 research
periods.
We observed that many of these domains shared the same HTML splash page of an unrelated food and
beverage group (Figure 2), which is likely an indicator of domain parking prior to or after
operationalization. We observed HTML splash pages in two other instances, including a
Sudoku-themed page associated with one DDNS domain and two other domains hosted on
172.86.77[.]85 (Figure 2). The server configurations of the GreenCharlie infrastructure suggest that two
other IPs — 38.180.146[.]219 and 45.137.213[.]145 — shared the same configurations. It is likely the two
additional domains are also linked to the large cluster of GreenCharlie infrastructure.

Network Intelligence Observations
Suspected Tiered Structure
Analysis of Recorded Future Network Intelligence revealed a likely tiered communication structure
between the IP addresses identified as part of this research. From July 25, 2024, until the time of this
writing, we observed that specific IP addresses hosting GreenCharlie domains, including
38.180.123[.]113, 38.180.123[.]135, 38.180.146[.]194, 38.180.146[.]174, 172.86.77[.]85, and 185.241.61[.]86,
communicated over ports such as 8624, 8647, 7564, and 1456 with various other IP addresses, some of
which are suspected of being linked to the same infrastructure.
Communication with Iran-based IP Addresses
Throughout July and August 2024, Recorded Future Network Intelligence depicted Iran-based IP
addresses communicating with GreenCharlie’s infrastructure, such as the IP address 38.180.146[.]194
and 38.180.146[.]174 (Figure 3).
To verify the suspicious nature of the Iranian IP addresses we compared the network traffic patterns
with that observed among GreenCharlie IP addresses. As noted above, from July 25, 2024, until the
time of this writing, GreenCharlie infrastructure communicated extensively over specific ports such as
8624. Over the same time period, IP addresses hosting GreenCharlie domains also communicated with
the following Iranian IP addresses over port 8624:
●
37.148.63[.]24
●
93.119.48[.]60
●
5.106.153[.]245
●
5.106.169[.]235

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS
We also observed Iran-based IP addresses communicating over ports 443 and 80 with GreenCharlie
infrastructure. In some cases, the IP addresses included those from the same local network; for
example, 185.166.104[.]3 and 185.166.104[.]4. This could suggest threat actors operating from nearby
workstations engaging with phishing infrastructure, or domestic navigation to the IP addresses,
potentially as part of internal targeting activity. Both IP addresses are owned by the entity Avaye
Hamrahe Houshmande Hezardastan (AS202319).

associated with GreenCharlie (Source: Recorded Future)
Phishing Link
From June 18, 2024, onward, we observed two domains resolving to 38.180.146[.]174 and
38.180.146[.]194, documentcloudeditor.ddnsgeek[.]com and uptimezonemetadta.run[.]place,
respectively. A submission to URLScan made on June 18, 2024, suggests a PhishTest portal was hosted
on 38.180.146[.]174 (Figure 4). The domain was issued a Let’s Encrypt certificate on the same day.
While we can’t confirm that the phishing page was created or accessed by GreenCharlie threat actors,
the domain does match GreenCharlie’s known domain registration naming conventions. Furthermore, it
is unclear whether PhishTest was used for attack operations, threat actor training, or Iran-based
security awareness training. Recorded Future Network Intelligence was not used at the time of the URL
submission to facilitate additional network intelligence research.
Regarding uptimezonemetadta.run[.]place, while we have not identified an “A” DNS record or TLS
certificate associated with the domain, a submission to VirusTotal on July 29, 2024, suggests it pointed
to 38.180.146[.]194. Recorded Future Network Intelligence revealed that 38.180.146[.]194 communicated
with other GreenCharlie infrastructure, including 38.180.123[.]113 and 172.86.77[.]85, between July 28
and July 30, 2024. Based on these links we assess this was highly likely a phishing portal associated
with the same threat activity.

Figure 4: Scanned domain documentcloudeditor.ddnsgeek[.]com resulted in the observed PhishTest portal
(Source: URLScan)
We also note that during the same timeframe, network traffic depicting full or half handshakes was
observed over ports 445 and 443 with Iran-based IP addresses, which included 193.111.236[.]130,
94.74.175[.]209, 185.143.233[.]120, 94.74.145[.]184, and 37.255.251[.]17. We note the possibility that
some of the IP addresses associated with port 445 communications are unrelated to this research, and
may be linked to scanning activity. However, based on the server configurations of 38.180.146[.]194 on
July 29, 2024, port 445 was enabled by the administrator, and therefore this could be an indicator of a
legitimate session.
Use of VPN Service
Recorded Future Network Intelligence also depicted consistent traffic between GreenCharlie
infrastructure and IP addresses associated with the ProtonVPN and Proton mail service provider. These
included the following IP addresses: 185.159.159[.]140, 185.70.42[.]45, 185.159.159[.]148, 185.70.42[.]37,
149.22.84[.]139, 146.70.174[.]66, 146.70.194[.]50, and 169.150.226[.]161. Queries (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) of
the IP addresses via the internet scanning service Shodan suggest the Proton servers are geolocated to
Germany, the US, Israel, and France.
The use of VPN services to obfuscate their activity is common among different Iranian APTs. We have
observed GreenCharlie use various other services in the past, such as ExpressVPN and PIA. However,
on occasion these groups also experience operational security mishaps, which lead to cyber
researchers more clearly detailing instances where Iranian IPs, almost certainly associated with an
attacker’s host, have been identified communicating with a victim network.
Malware Linked to GreenCharlie Infrastructure
Insikt Group identified significant code overlaps among the GORBLE, TAMECAT, and POWERSTAR (also
known as CharmPower and GorjolEcho) malware families, strongly suggesting they are variants of the
same family. Figure 5 highlights these overlaps, particularly across the initial three stages of each
7

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS
malware's infection chain. We note that Google-Mandiant has linked TAMECAT to threat activity
associated with APT42. Insikt Group tracks infrastructure that overlaps with APT42 as GreenBravo.
In the first stage, all three families employ a similar function to decode a URL, which is used to fetch the
next stage. Both GORBLE and TAMECAT hardcode a Mozilla user-agent header for the request, whereas
POWERSTAR relies on the WebClient’s default user agent. The response is Base64-decoded into a byte
array, followed by a bitwise NOT operation on each byte to produce a PowerShell function (either
KeyMaster or Borjol). This function is subsequently invoked within the script.
The second stage contains a single function that uses a hard-coded key and initialization vector (IV) to
decrypt the payload from the first stage using AES encryption. Once decrypted, the payload is
executed via the Invoke-Expression cmdlet. Additionally, this stage sets the C2 address and AES key
used for C2 communications with the final payload. The stage two payloads of TAMECAT and
POWERSTAR are nearly identical, differing only in hard-coded elements such as the C2 address, AES
key, and IV used for C2 communication. GORBLE’s version of stage two, however, replaces placeholder
values in the decrypted payload with hard-coded values and executes it using ScriptBlock.Create
instead of Invoke-Expression.
In the third stage, each malware family contacts the C2 server by sending a unique identifier
hard-coded in the script, along with the victim’s operating system and computer name. This information
is formatted as JSON, encrypted, Base64 encoded, and transmitted via an HTTP POST request to the
C2 server.

Attribution
Insikt Group tracks Iran-nexus threat activity clusters via specific infrastructure fingerprinting
methodologies. Since we started tracking GreenCharlie, we have observed them linked to attack
operations predominantly associated with strategic intelligence-gathering, as well as surveillance
activity. Insikt Group tracks GreenCharlie in close proximity with threat activity tied to GreenBravo and
GreenDelta (formerly TAG-56). We assess that all three groups share a strategic nexus to the Islamic
Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), in particular to that organization’s intelligence wing (IRGC-IO).

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS
Outlook
GreenCharlie remains highly active at the time of this writing, and while Insikt Group has not identified
direct evidence of targeting against the US government or political parties, we assess that there is an
elevated chance of attacks using the infrastructure listed in this report. On August 14, 2024,
Google-Mandiant issued a report citing that it had identified and intercepted attempts to target
individuals associated with US political campaigns. Based on the IoCs released by Google-Mandiant,
we were able to identify a direct infrastructure correlation with our GreenCharlie research.
It is highly likely that the observations and subsequent analysis conducted via Recorded Future Network
Intelligence point to Iranian threat actors engaging with the indicators listed in this report. While our
research will continue to examine the domains, infrastructure, network intelligence, and malware, we
recommend that interested parties pay increased attention to the traditional avenues Iranian APTs use
to target their victims, which is predominantly via social engineering and spearphishing emails. Iranian
APTs like to directly engage with targets via encrypted chats, SMS, and video calls to deliver malicious
files. As of this writing, we have not identified evidence of vulnerability exploitation, even though
historical cases indicate that elements associated with the IRGC’s cyber wing have exploited
vulnerabilities (Log4j, among others) to target systems.
