5Hundun?Hundun (Chinese: 
混沌; pinyin: Hùndùn; Wade–Giles: Hun-tun; lit. 'muddled confusion') is both a "legendary faceless being" in Chinese mythology and the "primordial and central chaos" in Chinese cosmogony, comparable with the world egg.-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundun

27DELTABEEF Backdoor
•32-bit shellcode formed custom backdoor 
–Designed as fully PIC
–XOR encoded configuration
–Dynamic API resolving using rol4addhash32
–Unique technique to find specific address on runtime
–C&C communication over HTTP but encrypted with AES + RSAConfig decription routine

28DELTABEEF: Unique technique to get address
•Some function, which DELTABEED needs to know its address on runtime, has 
0xDEADBEEFsignature in function
•DELTABEEF uses getter function to get the function address dynamically, as shown in the figure on the right
•This technique could be also for anti-static-analysis1)find address of 0xDEADBEEF value from current EIP2)sub_1ED8 returns this address 3)“sub eax, 8” calcurates the function entry address

•50 backdoor commands are supported
–File manipulation (read / write / move / delete)
–Reverse shell
–Process manipulation (run / enum / kill)
–UAC Bypass (eventvwr /fodhelper)

•Not overall picture of infrastructure, focus on overlaps between known infrastructure and Campaign #1/#2Known ToolKnown Tool

52Overview of Attribution
© 2022 Trend Micro Inc.
53ConclusionSummary
•We attributed 2 campaigns operated in 2021 into Earth Hundun, which is also known as BlackTech, based on the infrastructure overlap used by BlackTech before
•They added new tools, such as BUSYICE / BTSDOOR / TELESWORD / DELTABEEF into their arsenal
•It should be noted that we observed tool sharing between Blackgear and Earth HundunChallenges
•Attribution is getting hard
–Threat Actor is not a monolithic/static group, developer/operator could be changed and TTPs/tools could be shared with other teams/groups over time
–Increase of usage of OSS RedTeam tools makes attribution difficult
•Continuous Attribution is important
–Understand that attribution should be updated over time
–Continuously open the process of attribution (why do we think so?) for community, and re-define groups if needed
