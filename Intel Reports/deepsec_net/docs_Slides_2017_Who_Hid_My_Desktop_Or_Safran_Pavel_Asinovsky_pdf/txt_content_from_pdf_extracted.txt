Remote Desktop Software
•Allows remote control of a computer across the network.
•Originally was used for remote technical support.
•Used for server administration, conference calls, file transfers, etc.
•Has many implementations: RDP, VNC, Citrix, LogMeIn , TeamViewer etc.

6IBM Security
What is VNC
•Virtual Network Computing.
•Graphical desktop sharing system that 
uses the RFB protocol (Remote Frame 
Buffer).
•Composed of a server and a client. 
•Platform independent.
•Default TCP port 5900 .
•The desktop is shared.
•Used by many RAT (Remote Access 
Tool) Malware.

Part 1 –Sessions, Window Stations and Desktops

8IBM Security
Sessions , Window Stations and Desktops
•Securable kernel objects (contain a security 
descriptor).
•Used as containers to manage graphical objects, 
provide isolation and security.
•Structured in hierarchy.
•Each session contains only one interactive window 
station –WinSta 0.

9IBM Security
Sessions
•Represent a single user’s logon session. 
•Each user is assigned with a different session.
•Session 0  is the base session (the system user session).
•Session 0 is isolated from the user sessions.

10 IBM Security
Window Stations
•A logical security boundary.
•Contains a clipboard, atom table, and one 
or more desktop objects .
•Contains the keyboard, mouse, and a 
display device.
•Associated with a process.
•The interactive window station (WinSta 0) is 
the only that can display user interface or 
receive user input .
•Used by Chrome to implement a “Sandbox”.

11 IBM Security
Desktops
•A desktop is a logical display surface that contains UI objects such as windows, menus and hooks .
•Used as a container to create and manage windows.
•Associated with a thread.
•By default, there are few interactive desktops on windows: 
̶The default desktop: \Sessions \1\Windows \WinSta 0\Default 
̶The Winlogon secure desktop: \Sessions \1\Windows \WinSta 0\Winlogon
̶And more…
•There can be only one interactive desktop at a time.

12 IBM Security
Winlogon Secure Desktop Examples

13 IBM Security
Multiple Desktops
•Supported by Windows API since Windows 2000 .
•Have many legitimate uses:
̶Security applications
̶Multiple desktops
̶Windows logon/logoff screens 
̶UAC
̶Ctrl + Alt + Del screen
̶Screensavers

14 IBM Security
Desktops

15 IBM Security
Association to Desktops under the hood 
•When a program calls a USER 32 or GDI32 function, a window station is assigned to the calling 
process and a desktop is assigned to the calling thread according to the following rules:
̶As specified using the SetThreadDesktop () / SetProcessWindowStation () APIs.
̶Inherited from the parent process.
̶As specified in the STARTUPINFO structure.
̶The calling thread connects to the “ \Default” Desktop.

Part 2–Financial Malware and hVNC

17 IBM Security
About financial malware

18 IBM Security
Credential theft techniques 
•Web Injections
•Form Grabbing 
•Cookie Grabbing 
•KeyLogging (kernel mode \user mode)
•SSL Proxy (with certificate installation)
•DNS Pharming
•Redirects 

19 IBM Security
Web Injections

20 IBM Security
Financial Malware and hVNC
•Introduced to the world by the infamous Zeus malware.
•Allows the attacker to use the exact same machine as the victim.
•hVNC alone is usually not enough to commit a fraudulent transaction.
•Most modern financial malware have an embedded hVNC module (Zeus, Gozi, Dridex and more).

hVNC

22 IBM Security
hVNC
•Has same capabilities like regular VNC.
•Hidden (runs on a different desktop ).
•Cannot see the user’s desktop and can’t be seen by the user .
•Makes sure the SwitchDesktop API is never called .
•Has the same browser -system fingerprint as the user.
•Uses BackConnect –the server sends the first connection request to the client.
•Slightly modified RFB protocol to authenticate the malware.
•Must implement all the user interaction by itself (Windows supports only a single interactive desktop at a 
time).
•Can be used to log in to active web -sessions (shopping websites, Facebook, Gmail ).

Part 3 –Gozi ISFB hVNC case study

25 IBM Security
Gozi ISFB
•One of the most widespread financial malwares.
•One of the best hVNC modules found in the wild.
•Based on the hVNC code of Zeus.
•Has debug versions –fd36d1e2be1f0079 c7cb66288778 ffa9.
•Became an open source malware when an unknown player leaked it’s code (the hVNC module is 
missing from the source code).

26 IBM Security
Finding and Decrypting Gozi’s hVNC Module
•The hVNC module is downloaded from a remote server.
•The module is encrypted with two layers of encryption:
̶Serpent cipher with a randomly generated key (appended to 
the encrypted module). 
̶The Serpent encrypted hVNC module and the Serpent key are 
encrypted again using an RSA cipher.Encrypted hVNC , 
RSA key is stored in 
the binary
Encrypted hVNC + 
Serpent key
Decrypted moduleRSA decrypt

Gozi’s hVNC injection to processes
•The code injection technique is the same one the Gozi malware 
uses .CreateProcess

29 IBM Security
•Most hVNC modules send a unique identifier of the malware to the hVNC client in order to 
authenticate it. 
•A regular VNC client will not work out of the box, it has to be reversed and patched.
•After the authentication phase is over, the regular RFB protocol is initiated.hVNC Server Authentication

30 IBM Security
Browser manipulation
•Has code to deal with every common browser (IE, Chrome, Firefox, Opera).
•One cannot open the same browser in two separate desktop under the same user profile.

31 IBM Security
Browser manipulation -Chrome
•For Chrome, hVNC copies the whole user profile (user data folder) to a different location and setting it 
as the user data directory for the new browser process.

32 IBM Security
Browser manipulation -Chrome
•The browser might render pages using the graphics card (GPU).
•The browser uses a sandbox that might not play well with hVNC module.

33 IBM Security
Browser manipulation –Internet Explorer
•hVNC doesn’t want to allow IE to merge different frames into the same process.
•Virtual registry hooks
̶Hook registry query functions to change settings only in the hVNC session without any permanent changes.
•IE settings
̶Alter many IE settings virtually: protected mode for internet zones, enhanced protected mode and more.
•UAC adjustments:
̶When UAC is on and off, IE uses different location to load session cookies.

34 IBM Security
System manipulation
•Virtual registry hooks for changing system settings:
̶Disable visual effects [Software \Microsoft \Windows \CurrentVersion \Explorer \VisualEffects ]
̶Disable active desktop [ Software \Microsoft \Windows \CurrentVersion \Policies]
̶Removes wallpaper [Software \Microsoft \Internet Explorer \Desktop \General]
•Hook window events:
̶EVENT_OBJECT_CREATE
̶EVENT_OBJECT_HIDE
̶EVENT_OBJECT_SHOW
̶EVENT_OBJECT_DESTROY
̶EVENT_OBJECT_LOCATIONCHANGE
̶etc.
•Virtual keyboard and mouse ( PostMessage to the topmost window).
•Virtual Clipboard.
•Screenshots (Using BitBlt and PrintWindow APIs).
35 IBM Security
Taking the “h” off
•We are able to watch fraudsters in action with two easy steps.
•Open a handle by using the OpenDesktop API.
•Switch to the fraudster’s desktop using the SwitchDesktop API.

36 IBM Security
Piecing the Puzzle
•Obtain and decrypt the hVNC module.
•Inject the hVNC module into explorer.exe the same way Gozi does.
•Direct the hVNC module to communicate with our machine instead of the one originally 
hardcoded into the binary .
•Overcome the protocol differences between Gozi’s hVNC and the standard RFB.

37 IBM Security
Demo
•Manually inject the Gozi hVNC
module and make it run from 
explorer.exe.
•Make it connect to our VNC client by 
replacing the IP address.
•Establish a connection and bypass 
the bot identifier authentication.•Set up a VNC client in listening mode.
•Wait for an RFB connection from the 
server and obtain control over the 
victim’s machine.Client (Attacker) Server (Victim)
38 IBM Security
IOCs
•Second explorer.exe holding a handle to an unknown desktop (Not the default one).
•Usually has ctfmon.exe automatically running under it (text input services support).
•Has processes running under it that you don’t see their windows, such as a browser.
39 IBM Security
Conclusions
•The hVNC code is extremely complicated.
•It is one of the top tools in the financial malware toolkit.
•It uses many cool tricks and manipulations in order to achieve it’s purpose.
•Although not new, it is still popular and common in online banking fraud today.
