IcePeony with the '996' work culture
2024-10-16
This blog post is based on “IcePeony with the ‘996’ work culture” that we presented at VB2024. We are
grateful to Virus Bulletin for giving us the opportunity to present.

tl;dr
We have discovered a previously unknown China-nexus APT group, which we have named “IcePeony”.
Due to operational mistakes, they exposed their resources, allowing us to uncover details of their attacks.
IcePeony is a China-nexus APT group that has been active since at least 2023. They have targeted
government agencies, academic institutions, and political organizations in countries such as India,
Mauritius, and Vietnam.
Their attacks typically start with SQL Injection, followed by compromise via webshells and
backdoors. Interestingly, they use a custom IIS malware called “IceCache”.
Through extensive analysis, we strongly believe that IcePeony is a China-nexus APT group,
operating under harsh work conditions.

IcePeony
IcePeony is an unknown attack group. Our research shows that they have been active since at least
2023. They mainly target Asian countries, such as India and Vietnam. In the log files we analyzed, there
were over 200 attempts to attack various government websites in India.
They use SQL injection attacks on public web servers. If they find a vulnerability, they install a webshell
or malware. Ultimately, their goal is to steal credentials.
We believe IcePeony works for China’s national interests. It is possible that they prioritize China’s
maritime strategy.
Our research found that IcePeony targeted government and academic institutions in India, political
parties in Vietnam, and government institutions in Mauritius. Recently, they may have also attacked
Brazil. It is likely that they will expand their targets in the future.
OPSEC fail
In July, we identified a host that was publicly exposing various attack tools, including CobaltStrike and
sqlmap, via an open directory. What made this discovery even more compelling was the presence of a
zsh_history file.
3/19
One of the most interesting findings was the zsh_history file. Similar to bash_history, the zsh_history file
records command history. However, zsh_history also logs timestamps, allowing us to pinpoint the exact
time each command was executed. This enabled us to construct a highly detailed timeline of the attack.
Unlike a typical timeline created by an IR or SOC analyst, this one offers insight from the attacker’s
perspective. We could observe their trial-and-error process and how they executed the intrusion.
4/19
The zsh_history was not the only interesting file. There were many others.
For example, IcePeony had configured several helper commands in their alias file, including shortcuts to
simplify lengthy commands and commands to quickly access help information.
Here is an example with Mimikatz. By typing “hPass,” the attacker could display basic tutorials for
Mimikatz. This improved their effectiveness during attacks.
Intrusion Timeline
We obtained two weeks’ worth of command history from the zsh_history. Let’s go through the events of
each day.
5/19
On day-1, the attacker attempted SQL injections on several government websites. When the exploit
succeeded, they installed a webshell or IceCache, establishing a foothold for the attack. On day-2, they
reviewed the domain information of compromised hosts and created accounts for further exploitation. On
day three, which was a Sunday, no actions were taken. On day-3, which was a Sunday, they did not
perform any actions. It seems the attacker does not work on Sundays. On day-4, they used IceCache to
configure proxy rules. We will explain this in more detail later. On day-5, the attacker expanded their
reach by attempting more SQL injections on other government websites. On day-6, they used various
tools, including IcePeony’s custom tool called StaX and a rootkit called Diamorphine. On day-7, they
continued to attack other hosts using tools like URLFinder and sqlmap.
On day-8, they used IceCache to steal information from the compromised environment, especially
focusing on domain users. On day-9, they were quiet and only performed connection checks. On day-10,
they did nothing since it was a Sunday. On day-11, they used tools like craXcel and WmiExec. They used
craXcel, an open-source tool, to unlock password-protected Microsoft Office files. On day-12, they used
6/19
IceCache to add proxy rules and set persistence with scheduled tasks. On day-13 and day-14, they
explored other hosts for further exploitation.
Over the course of two weeks, the attacker utilized a variety of tools and commands to compromise
government websites and exfiltrate information.
Tools
IcePeony uses a wide range of tools, with a particular preference for open-source ones. Here, we will
highlight only the most distinctive tools they use.
StaX
StaX is a customized variant of the open-source tool Stowaway, a high-performance proxy tool. The
attacker enhanced Stowaway with custom processing. Based on development strings, we called this
version StaX.
StaX included encryption for communication targets specified in active mode using Custom Base64 and
AES.
7/19
ProxyChains
ProxyChains is an open-source proxy tool. The attacker used ProxyChains to run script files on victim
hosts.
info.sh is a script that collects system information from the compromised environment. It gathers
environment information, user information, installed tool versions, network settings, SSH configuration
files, and command history.
linux_back.sh is a script for backdoors and persistence. It downloads and runs a backdoor shell script
from the server and creates backdoor users.
Interestingly, they installed a rootkit called Diamorphine, which is available on GitHub.
Malware
8/19
The IcePeony server contained malware targeting IIS, which we named IceCache. They used IceCache
to attack the attack surface server. Additionally, during the investigation, we discovered another related
malware, which we called IceEvent. Although no logs of using IceEvent were found. We believe it was
used to compromise another computer that was not connected to the internet.
IceCache
IceCache is an ELF64 binary developed in Go language. It is customized based on the open-source
software reGeorge.
To facilitate their intrusion operations, they added file transmission commands and command execution
functionality.
9/19
IceCache module is installed and run on IIS servers. The number of commands change, but they are
classified into two types based on authentication tokens. We found files with remaining PDB information.
These files were developed by a user named “power” in a project called “cachsess”

These are the IceCache modules found so far. The first sample we are aware of was compiled in August
2023 and submitted to VirusTotal in October. Since there is no discrepancy between the compille time
and the first submission, we believe the dates are reliable.
Many new samples have also been found since 2024. Most of the submitters are from India, which
matches the victim information we have gathered from OpenDir data.
The number of commands has change over time. It is show that the malware’s developers have made
improvements while continuing their intrusion operations.

A
Similarities
We believe that IceEvent was developed because a simple passive backdoor was needed during
intrusions, based on code similarities with IceCache. Both IceCache and IceEvent use the same key for
XOR to encode communication data. And PDB information shows that the same developer created both
malware.
This is the XOR-based data encoding process used for communication data, which is equal to both
malware.
This is the command execution process equal to both malware. Since the function calls and branching
processes are exactly the same, we believe they were compiled from the same source code. Other
commands also match perfectly.
13/19
The communication data of IceCache and IceEvent is only encoded using the XOR process mentioned
earlier, making it easy to decode. Here is an example of decoding the data during command execution.
Attribution
We investigated the attacker’s activity times based on the timestamp information in the zsh_history file.
As a result, we found that the attacker is likely operating in the UTC+8 time zone. Surprisingly, the
attacker works from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m., which is a 14-hour workday. They are remarkably diligent workers.
14/19
Similarly, we investigated the changes in activity based on the day of the week. It seems that the
attackers work six days a week. While they are less active on Fridays and Saturdays, their only full day
off appears to be Sunday. This investigation suggests that the attackers are not conducting these attacks
as personal activities, but are instead engaging in them as part of organized, professional operations.
By the way, have you heard of the term “996 working hour system”? This term originated in China’s IT
industry. In China’s IT industry, long working hours see as a problem. It refers to working from 9 a.m. to 9
p.m.,six days a week. Such hard work conditions are called the “996 working hour system”. IcePeony
might be working under the 996 working hour system.
15/19
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/996_working_hour_system
Next, There is a very simple example to consider when discussing attribution. IcePeony sometimes
includes Simplified Chinese comments in the tools they use. Here, we provide an example of a wrapper
script for the IceCache Client. From this, we can conclude that IcePeony is a threat actor from a region
where Simplified Chinese is commonly used.
IcePeony uses an original malware called IceCache. As previously mentioned, IceCache is based on
reGeorge. More specifically, IceCache contains a string referring to a project named reGeorgGo.
Upon investigating reGeorgGo, We found that it was developed by a Chinese security engineer. There is
no other information about this project on the internet, aside from the developer’s blog. It was a not well-
known tool. However, the publicly available reGeorgGo is a tool with only three arguments, where as
IceCache has more commands added to it.
16/19
https://github.com/zz1gg/secdemo/tree/main/proxy/reGeorgGo
Let’s examine attribution from another side. In this attack campaign, IcePeony targeted India, Mauritius,
and Vietnam. While attacks on India and Vietnam are generally not uncommon. What about Mauritius?
Mauritius is a small country located in the Indian Ocean. Interestingly, Mauritius has recently formed a
cooperation with India. They are wary of China’s expansion into the Indian Ocean and have begun
17/19
various forms of collaboration to counter this influence.
https://www.mea.gov.in/newsdetail1.htm?12042/
We summarize the attribution information using the Diamond Model.
IcePeony consists of Simplified Chinese speakers who show interest in the governments of Indian Ocean
countries and work under the 996 working hour system.
They prefer open-source software developed in Chinese-speaking regions and use their original
malware, IceCache and IceEvent. In attacks on the Indian government, they used VPSs located in the
Indian region. Additionally, the governments and education sectors in Mauritius and Vietnam were also
targeted.
18/19
Wrap-Up
In this blog post, we introduced IcePeony. IcePeony is a newly emerging attack group. Our investigation
shows that they have been active since at least 2023. Their primary targets are countries in Asia, such as
India and Vietnam.
The log files we analyzed recorded attempts to attack over 200 different Indian government websites.
IcePeony typically attempts SQL Injection attacks on publicly accessible web servers. If vulnerabilities are
found, they install web shells or execute malware. Ultimately, they aim to steal credentials.
We suspect that IcePeony operates as a group of individuals conducting cyberattacks in support of
China’s national interests, possibly in connection with China’s maritime strategy. They remain active, and
we must continue monitoring their activities closely moving forward.
