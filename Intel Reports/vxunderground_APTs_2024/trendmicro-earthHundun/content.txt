Summary
Earth Hundun is known for targeting the Asia-Pacific and now employs updated tactics for infection
spread and communication.
This report details how Waterbear and Deuterbear operate, including the stages of infection,
command and control (C&C) interaction, and malware component behavior.
Deuterbear, while similar to Waterbear in many ways, shows advancements in capabilities such as
including support for shellcode plugins, avoiding handshakes for RAT operation, and using HTTPS
for C&C communication.
Comparing the two malware variants, Deuterbear uses a shellcode format, possesses anti-memory
scanning, and shares a traffic key with its downloader unlike Waterbear.
The evolution of Waterbear into Deuterbear indicates the development of tools for anti-analysis and
detection evasion in Earth Hundun's toolbox.
Introduction
In our previous report, we introduced the sophisticated cyberespionage campaign orchestrated by Earth
Hundun, a threat actor known for targeting the Asia-Pacific region using the Waterbear malware and its
latest iteration, Deuterbear. We first observed Deuterbear being used by Earth Hundun in October 2022,
and it has since been part of the group’s subsequent campaigns. 
2/12
Our analysis provided insights into the intricate workings of the downloader, detailing its infection flow,
traffic behavior, anti-analysis techniques, and evolutionary trajectory.
In this entry, we examine the behavior of the final Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that we recently managed
to download from a C&C server, based on an Earth Hundun campaign from 2024.
In our first entry, we focused on the Waterbear downloader (the first stage) and examined its network
behavior. This report uses a case study to describe how the threat actor uses the Waterbear RAT and
plugin during the second stage and how Waterbear downloaders are spread to other machines, making it
more difficult to detect and track.
Furthermore, we examine the major updates to Deuterbear, including the ability to accept plugins with
shellcode formats and the ability to function even without handshakes during RAT operation.
Finally, we will share our findings about the interaction between Earth Hundun and its victims through the
Waterbear and Deuterbear malware, showcasing the sophisticated tactics employed by this threat actor.
Waterbear case study
The following flow chart from a previous campaign illustrates how Waterbear operates in the victim's
environment and then spreads more Waterbear downloaders across the internal network.
Figure 2. One of the Waterbear campaign attack chains
First stage
Waterbear usually employs a group of three files for downloading purposes during the first stage of an
attack (as mentioned in the previous report). These include the patched legitimate executable, the loader,
and the encrypted downloader.
Second stage
1. After connecting to the C&C server, we downloaded the Waterbear RAT (A) in memory, which
contains several command codes inside (see Table 1 for the list of RAT commands). In this case,
3/12
the Waterbear RAT (A) was only used to download the Waterbear plugin via RAT command 1010
and activate the first export function, “Start”, in the plugin to inject the chosen process.
2. The Waterbear plugin contains Waterbear downloader versions 0.27 and 0.28, both unencrypted,
varying based on the process's bit version. If the process is 32-bit, version 0.27 of the Waterbear
downloader will run. On the other hand, version 0.28 will execute to facilitate further downloads on
the 64-bit process.
Waterbear downloader versions 0.27 and 0.28 are the latest that we know of. Their behaviors are
the same as the versions before 2020.
3. In this case, the Waterbear plugin injects into a 64-bit process, which results in version 0.28 of the
Waterbear downloader trying to connect to the new C&C IP address — which is assigned by
Waterbear RAT (A)  —  and download Waterbear RAT (B), which is almost the same as the
previous one, just with a different RSA key inside.
4. Waterbear RAT (B) will be used to collect the information from the infected machine, including the
list of drives and files, and then further spread the Waterbear downloader to other machines.
Interestingly, Earth Hundun will replace the C&C string with an internal IP address after
downloading the new stage of the RAT or downloader. This is to erase activity traces or connect to
other C&C servers in the victim's environment, showing that the threat actor can arbitrarily choose
its connection targets.

This section will explain Earth Hundun's use of Deuterbear and provide a comprehensive analysis of the
Deuterbear RAT.
Deuterbear installation
6/12
Figure 3. Installation pathway of Deuterbear
download
The installation pathway of Deuterbear is depicted in Figure 3. Note that it is similar to Waterbear, which
implements two stages to install the backdoor.
In the first stage, the loader employs a basic XOR calculation to decrypt the downloader, facilitating the
retrieval of the first stage RAT from the C&C server. Subsequently, the threat actor applies the first stage
RAT to survey the victim’s system and identify an appropriate folder for persistence. This is where the
second-stage Deuterbear components will be installed, including the loader with CryptUnprotectData
decryption, the encrypted downloader, and associated registries (the decryption flow was discussed in
the previous blog entry).
In most of the infected systems, only the second stage Deuterbear is available. Our monitoring indicates
that all components of the first stage Deuterbear are totally removed after the “persistence installation” is
completed. It seems that Earth Hundun prefers to keep the loaders using CryptUnprotectData decryption,
even in cases where the successful installation of Deuterbear is achieved during the first stage. This
strategy effectively protects their tracks and prevents the malware from easily being analyzed by threat
researchers, particularly in simulated environments rather than real victim systems.
Deuterbear RAT
The Deuterbear RAT directly inherits several components from the downloader, including:
7/12
All anti-analysis techniques (please refer to our previous report for more details).
HTTPS tunnel.
Routine to receive and send traffic.
RC4 key to decrypt and encrypt traffic.
Routine to decrypt and encrypt the desired function.
Key to decrypt and encrypt the desired function.
Due to having the same HTTPS channel and RC4 traffic key, Deuterbear RAT doesn't require a
handshake with the C&C server to update communication protocols. This enables the threat actor to
seamlessly control the client, regardless of whether the process is in the downloader or RAT status. Prior
to executing backdoor commands, the Deuterbear RAT transmits victim information to the C&C server via
RAT command 975 with the structure (Table 3) highly reminiscent of the Waterbear RAT (Table 2).

Deuterbear RAT command
Comparing Deuterbear with Waterbear reveals several functionalities directly replicated from the
Waterbear RAT, such as process management, file management, and remote shell capabilities. 
Although Deuterbear streamlines its capabilities, retaining only 20 RAT commands (Table 4) compared to
over 60 for Waterbear (Table 1), the Deuterbear RAT accepts more plugins to enhance flexibility and
accommodate additional functionalities, including two shellcodes and a portable executable (PE) DLL via
RAT command 979. After installing the plugins, the threat actor sends the next traffic to determine which
plugin is launched. There are three kinds of protocols:
8/12
Execute the first shellcode and the first export function of PE(DLL)
Execute the second shellcode and the first export function of PE(DLL)
Only execute the first export function of PE(DLL)

Conclusion and recommendations
Waterbear has gone through continuous evolution, eventually giving rise to the emergence of a new
malware, Deuterbear. Interestingly, both Waterbear and Deuterbear continue to evolve independently,
rather than one simply replacing the other.
Based on the downloader analysis presented in April 2024. We made a comprehensive examination of
the RAT, which is a component seldom downloaded from the C&C server due to temporary port
openings. Through a systematic comparison of Deuterbear and Waterbear in the loader, downloader,
RAT and behavioral aspects, we gained insights into the evolution of the techniques employed by Earth
Hundun. While the Waterbear and Deuterbear family represent just one facet of the group’s arsenal, we
believe that continuous refinement of tools will be implemented in other malware for anti-analysis, and
detection evasion, particularly in traffic and file handling.
Organizations can defend themselves from Earth Hundun attacks by performing a memory scan for
downloads and the Waterbear and Deuterbear RATs. Furthermore, detecting the registry used to decrypt
the Deuterbear downloader can help scan for its presence within the system.
