#StopRansomware: BianLian Data Extortion 
Group  
Summary 
Note:  This joint Cybersecurity Advisory is part o f an ongoing 
#StopRansomware effort to publish advisories for network 
defenders that detail various ransomware variants and ransomware threat actors. These #StopRansomware advisories 
include recently and historically observed tactics, techniques, 
and proce dures (TTPs) and indicators of compromise (IOCs) to 
help organizations protect against ransomware. Visit 
stopransomware.gov  to see all #StopRansomware advisories 
and to l earn more about other ransomware threats and no -cost 
resources.  
Note: This advisory , originally published May 2023,  was updated 
November 20, 2024,  with additional TTPs obtained as of June 
2024  through FBI and ASD’S ACSC  investigations and industry 
threat intelligence.  
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the 
Australian Signals Directorate’s Australian Cyber Security Centre (ASD’s ACSC) are releasing this joint 
Cybersecurity Advisory to diss eminate known BianLian ransomware and data extortion group IOCs and 
TTPs identified through FBI and ASD ’S ACSC  investigations . 
(New, November 20, 2024 ) The reporting agencies are aware of multiple ransomware groups, like 
BianLian, that seek to misattribute locat ion and nationality by choosing foreign -language names, almost 
May 16, 202 3 
 
Actions to take today to mitigate 
cyber threats from BianLian data 
extortion:  
 Strictly limit the use of RDP and other remote desktop services.  
 Disable command -line and 
scripting activities and permissions.  
 Restrict usage of PowerShell and update Windows 
PowerShell or PowerShell Core 
to the latest version.  
TLP: CLEAR

TLP: CLEAR certainly to complicate attribution efforts. BianLian is a ransomware developer, deployer, and data 
extortion cybercriminal group, likely based in Russia, with multiple Russia -based affiliates.  
(Updated , November 20, 2024)  BianLian group actors have affected organizations in multiple U.S. critical 
infrastructure sectors since June 2022. They have also targeted Australian critical infrastructure sectors in 
addition to professional services and property development. The group gains access to victim systems 
through valid Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) credentials, uses open -source tools and command -line 
scripting for discovery and credential harvesting, and exfiltrates victim data via File Transfer P rotocol (FTP), 
Rclone, or Mega. BianLian  then extort s money by threatening to release data if payment is not made. 
BianLian group originally employed a double -extortion model in which they encrypted victims’ systems after 
exfiltrating the data; however, th ey shifted primarily to exfiltration -based extortion  around January 2023  
and shifted to exclusively exfiltration -based extortion  around January 2024 . 
FBI, CISA, and ASD’S ACSC encourage critical infrastructure organizations and small - and medium -sized 
organizati ons to implement the recommendations in the Mitigations  section of this advisory to reduce the 
likelihood and impact of BianLian and other ransomware and data extortion  incidents.  
For a downloadable copy of IOCs, see AA23 -136A STIX XML  (XML, 35 KB)  
Technical Details  
Note:  This advisory uses the MITRE ATT&CK® Matrix for Enterprise  framework, version 1 6. See the MITRE 
ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques  section of this advisory for a table of the threat actors’ activity mapped to 
MITRE ATT&CK tactics an d techniques.  
BianLian is a ransomware developer, deployer, and data extortion cybercriminal group. S ince June 2022 , 
FBI has observed BianLian group affecting organizations in multiple U.S. critical infrastructure sectors. In 
Australia, ASD ’S ACSC  has observed B ianLian group predominately targeting private enterprises, including 
one critical infrastructure organization. BianLian group originally employed a double -extortion model in 
which they exfiltrated financial, client, business, technical, and personal files for leverage and encrypted 
victims’ systems. In 2023, FBI observed BianLian shift primarily to exfiltration -based extortion with victims’ 
systems left intact, and ASD ’S ACSC  observed BianLian shift exclusively to exfiltration -based extortion. 
BianLian actors warn of financial, business, and legal ramifications if payment is not made.  
Initial Access  
BianLian group actors gain initial access to networks by leveraging compromised Remote Desktop Protocol 
(RDP) credentials likely acquired from initial access brokers [ T1078],[ T1133] or via phishing [ T1566 ]. 
(New, November 20, 2024 ) BianLian group actors target public -facing applications of both Windows and 
ESXi infrastructure, possibly leveraging the ProxyShell ( CVE-2021-34473, CVE -2021-34523, and CVE-
2021-31207 ) exploit chain to gain initial access [ T1190 ]. 
Command and Control  
BianLian group actors implant a custom backdoor specific to each victim written in Go (see the Indicators 
of Compromise  Section for an example) [ T1587.001 ] and install remote management and access software 
for persistence and command and control [ T1105],[ T1219 ]. 
TLP: CLEAR 
FBI | CISA | ASD’s ACSC  
Page 3 of 23 | Product ID:  AA23 -136A  
TLP: CLEAR FBI also observed BianLian group actors create and/or activate local administrator accounts [ T1136.001 ] 
and change those account passwords [ T1098 ]. 
(New, November 20, 2024 ) BianLian group actors may be using the reverse proxy tool Ngrok and/or a 
modified version of the open-source Rsocks utility [ T1090 ]. The group ma y have used external proxy 
Rsocks to establish SOCKS5 network tunnels from victim networks and to mask the destination of C2 
traffic [ T1090.002 ]. 
Privilege Escalation  
(New, November 20, 2024 ) BianLian group actors have exploited CVE-2022-37969 , which affects 
Windows 10 and 11 systems, to escalate privileg es [T1068 ]. 
Defense Evasion  
BianLian group actors use PowerShell [ T1059.001] and Windows Command Shell [ T1059.003 ] to disable 
antivirus tools [ T1562.001 ], specifically Windows defender and Anti -Malware Scan Interface (AMSI). 
BianLian actors modify the  Windows Registry [ T1112 ] to disable tamper protection for Sophos SAVEnabled, 
SEDEenabled, and SAVService  services, which enables them to uninstall the se services. See Appendix: 
Windows PowerShell and Command Shell Activity  for additional information, including specific commands.  
(New, November 20, 2024 ) BianLian group actors rename binaries and scheduled tasks after legitimate 
Windows services or security products [ T1036.004 ]. BianLian group actors may pack executables using 
UPX to conceal their code in an attempt to bypass heuristic and signature -based detection methods 
[T1027.002 ]. 
Discovery  
BianLian  group actors  use a combination of compiled tools, which they first download to the victim 
environment, to learn about the victim’s environment. BianLian group actors have used:  
 Advanced Port Scanner,  a network scanner used to find open ports on network computers and 
retrieve versions of programs running on the detected ports [ T1046 ]. 
 SoftPerfect Ne twork Scanner (netscan.exe), a network scanner that can ping computers, scan 
ports, and discover shared folders [T1135 ]. 
 SharpShares to enumerate acces sible network shares in a domain.  
 PingCastle to enumerate Active Directory (AD) [ T1482 ]. 
o PingCastle provides an AD map to visualize the hierarchy of trust relationships.  
BianLian actors also use native Windows tools and Windows Command Shell to:  
 Query currently logged -in users [ T1033 ]. 
 Query the doma in controller to identify:  
o All groups [ T1069.002 ]. 
o Accounts in the Domain Admins and Domain Computers groups [ 1087.002 ]. 
o All users in the domain.  
 Retrieve a list of all domain controllers and domain trusts.  
TLP: CLEAR 
FBI | CISA | ASD’s ACSC  
Page 4 of 23 | Product ID:  AA23 -136A  
TLP: CLEAR  Identify accessible devices on the network [T1018 ]. 
See Appendix: Windows PowerShell and Command Shell Activity  for additional information, including 
specific commands.  
(New, November 20, 2024 ) BianLian group actors use PowerShell for discovery , using  PowerShell scripts to 
list all running processes [ T1057 ], list all software installed [ T1518], and list all local drives [ T1082 ]. 
Credential  Access  
BianLian group uses valid accounts for lateral movement through the network and to pursue other follow -
on activity. To obtain the credentials, BianLian group actors use Windows Command Shell to find 
unsecured credentials on the local machine [ T1552.001 ]. FBI also observed BianLian harvest  credentials 
from the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) memory [ T1003.001 ], download RDP 
Recognizer (a tool that could be used to brute force RDP passwords or check for RDP vulnerabilities) to the victim system, and attempt to access an AD  domain database ( NTDS.dit) [
T1003.003 ]. 
In one case, FBI obs erved BianLian actors use a portable executable version of an Impacket  tool 
(secretsdump.py) to move  laterally to a domain controller and harvest credential hashes from it.  Note:  
Impacket is a Python toolkit for programmatically constructing and manipulating network protocols. Through the Command Shell, an Impacket user with credentials can run commands on a remote device 
using the Windows management protocols required to support an enterprise network. Threat actors ca n 
run portable executable files on victim systems using local user rights, assuming the executable is not 
blocked by an application allowlist or antivirus solution.  
See Appendix: Windows PowerShell and Command Shell Activity  for additional information.  
(New, November 20, 2024 ) BianLian group actors use SessionGopher, likely to extract session information 
for remote access tools ( RATs ) [T1552.004 ]. 
Persistence and Lateral Movement  
BianLian  group actors  use PsExec and RDP with valid accounts for lateral movement [ T1021.001 ]. Prior to 
using RDP, BianLian actors used Command Shell and native Windows tools to add user accounts to the 
local Remote Desktop Users group, modified the  added account’s password, and modified Windows 
firewall rules to allow incoming RDP traffic [ T1562.004 ]. See Appendix: Windows PowerShell and 
Com mand Shell Activity  for additional information . 
In one case, FBI found a forensic artifact ( exp.exe) on a compromised system that  likely exploits the 
Netlogon vulnerability ( CVE-2020-1472 ) and connects to a domain controller.  
(New, November 20, 2024 ) In another instance, ASD ’S ACSC  found that BianLian  group actors established 
network login type 3 connections to systems via Server Message Block (SMB) [ T1021.002 ].  
(New, November 20, 2024 ) BianLian  group actors have created accounts and used them for lateral 
movement and persistence. In one confirmed compromise, BianLian actors created multiple domain admin accounts [
T1136.002 ] for use in lateral movement to the domain controller. In the same compromise, the 
actors also created multiple Azure AD accounts [ T1136.003 ] to maintain access to the victim systems.  
TLP: CLEAR 
FBI | CISA | ASD’s ACSC  
Page 5 of 23 | Product ID:  AA23 -136A  
TLP: CLEAR (New, November 20, 2024 ) BianLian group actors also installed webshells [ T1505.003 ] for persistence on 
a victim’s Exchange server. 
Collection  
FBI observed BianLian group actors using malware ( system.exe) that enumerates registry values [ T1012 ] 
and files [ T1083] and  copies clipboard data from u sers [ T1115 ]. 
(New, November 20, 2024 ) BianLian group actors ran PowerShell scripts to compress and/or encrypt data 
[T1560 ] that is collected prior to exfiltration.  
Exfiltration and Impact  
BianLian group actors search for sensitive files using PowerShell scripts (See Appen dix: Windows 
PowerShell and Command Shell Activity ) and exfiltrate them for data extortion. Prior to January 2023, 
BianLian actors encrypted files [ T1486 ] after exfiltration for double extortion.  
BianLian group uses File Transfer Protocol (FTP) [ T1048] and Rclone , a tool used to sync files to cloud 
storage, to exfiltrate data [ T1537 ]. FBI observed BianLian group actors install Rclone and other files in 
generic and typically unchecked folders such as programdata \vmware  and music folders. ASD’S ACSC  
observed BianLian group actors use Mega file -sharing service to exfiltrate  victim data [ T1567.002 ]. 
(New, November 20, 2024 ) Prior to January 2024, BianLian used an  encryptor ( encryptor.exe ) that 
modified all encrypted f iles to have the .bianlian  extension. The encryptor created a ransom note in 
each affected directory. According to the ransom note, BianLian group specifically looked for, encrypted, 
and exfiltrated financial, client, business, technical, and personal files. (See Figure 1  for a legacy 
ransomware n ote).

- What will happen next? 
Path number 1: 
  In 3 days we will start emailing and calling your partners and employees with 
notes of your company's breach and announce this data leak at our website. 
  During this time your data will be sorted and prepared to be published. 
  After that your data will be uploaded, your competitors, partners, clients, 
authorities, lawyer and tax agenesis would be able to access it. We will start 
mailing and calling your clients.  
 Or that will not happen, If we will close this deal in time!!!  
- What should i do?  
  Embrace it and pay us. After that your data will be erased from our systems, 
with proof's provided to you. Also you might request your network improvement 
report.  
- What should i NOT do?  
  1. Don't do any silly things, don't treat it lightly too. We got proofs that 
your data was kept with a number of data security violations of data breach 
laws. The penalty payments would be huge if we will anonymously sent our briefs 
and notes about your network structure to the regulators.  
  2. Based on your position in the company call your management to speak. DO NOT 
try to speak speak instead of your superiors, based on our experience, that may lead to disaster.  
  - Why this happened? 
  - Your network and data were not secure enough. We took advantage of it.  
  - What else should i know:  
  Our business depends on the reputation even more than many others. If we will 
take money and spread your information-  we will have issues with payments in 
future. So, we will stick to our promises and reputation. That works in both 
ways: if we said that we will email all your staff and publicly spread all your 
data- we will.

Mitig ations 
FBI, CISA, and ASD’S ACSC recommend organizations implement the mitigations below to improve your 
organization’s cybersecurity posture on the basis of the threat actors’ activity. These mitigations align with 
the Cross -Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goa ls (CPGs) developed by CISA and the National Institute of 
Standards and Technology (NIST). The CPGs provide a minimum set of practices and protections that CISA and NIST recommend all organizations implement. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on existing cybers ecurity 
TLP: CLEAR 
FBI | CISA | ASD’s ACSC  
Page 15 of 23 | Product ID:  AA23 -136A  
TLP: CLEAR frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful threats and TTPs. Visit CISA’s 
Cross -Sector Cybersecurity Performa nce Goals  for more information on the CPGs, including additional 
recommended baseline protections.  
 Reduce threat of malicious actors using remote access tools by:  
o Auditing remote access tools  on your network to identify currently used and/or authorized 
software.  
o Reviewing logs for execution of remote access software to detect abnormal use of programs 
running as a portable executable [ CPG 2.T ]. 
o Using security software to detect instances of remote access  software only being loaded in 
memory.  
o Requiring authorized remote access solutions only be used from within your network over 
approved remote access solutions , such as virtual private networks (VPNs) or virtual desktop 
interfaces (VDIs). 
o Blocking both inbound and outbound connections on common  remote access software ports 
and protocols at the network perimeter.  
 Implement application controls to manage and control execution of software , including allowlisting 
remote access programs.  
o Application controls should prevent installation and execution of portable versions of unauthorized remote access and other software. A properly configured application allowlisting 
solution will block any unlisted application execution. Allowlisting is important because antivirus solutions may fail to detect the execu tion of malicious portable executables when the files use 
any combination of compression, encryption, or obfuscation.  
• See NSA Cybersecurity Information sheet Enforce Signed Software Execution Policies
 for 
additional guidance.  
 Strictly limit the use of RDP and other remote desktop services.  If RDP is necessary, rigorously 
apply best pract ices, for example [ CPG 2.W ]: 
o Audit the network for systems using RDP.  
o Close unused RDP ports.  
o Enforce accou nt lockouts after a specified number of attempts.  
o Apply phishing -resistant multifactor authentication (MFA) . 
o Log RDP login attempts.  
 Disable command -line and scripting activities and permissions [CPG 2.N ]. 
 Restrict  the use of PowerShell , using Group Policy, and only grant to specific users on a case -by-
case basis. Typically, only those users or administrators who manage the network or Windows operating systems (OSs) should be permitted to use PowerShell [
CPG 2.E ]. 
 Update Windows PowerShell or PowerShell Core to the latest version and uninstall all earlier 
PowerShell ve rsions. Logs from Windows PowerShell prior to version 5.0 are either non -existent or 
do not record enough detail to aid in enterprise monitoring and incident response activities [ CPG 
1.E, 2.S , 2.T]. 
TLP: CLEAR 
FBI | CISA | ASD’s ACSC  
Page 16 of 23 | Product ID:  AA23 -136A  
TLP: CLEAR  Enable enhanced PowerShell logging  [CPG 2.T , 2.U ]. 
o PowerShell logs contain valuable data, including historical OS and registry interaction and 
possible TTPs of a threat actor’s PowerShell use.  
o Ensure PowerShell instances, using the latest version, have module, script block, and 
transcription logging enabled (enhanced logging).  
o The two logs that record PowerShell activity are the PowerShell Windows Event Log and the 
PowerShell Operational Log. FBI and CISA recommend turning on these two Windows Event Logs with a retention period of at least 180 days. These logs should be checked on a regular 
basis to confirm whether the log data has been deleted or logging has been turned off. Set the 
storage size permitted for both logs to as large as possible.  
 Configure the Windows Registry to require User Account Control (UAC) approval for any PsExec 
operations requiring administrator privileges to reduce the risk of lateral movement by PsExec.  
 Review domain controllers, servers, workstations, and act ive directories  for new and/or 
unrecognized accounts [ CPG 4.C ]. 
 Audit user accounts with administrative privileges and  configure access controls according to the 
principle of least privilege [ CPG 2.E ]. 
 Reduce the threat of credential compromise via the following:  
o Place domain admin accounts in the protected users’ group  to prevent caching of password 
hashes locally.  
o Implement Credential Guard for Windows 10 and Server 2016  (Refer to Microsoft: Manage 
Windows Defender Credential Guard  for more information). For Windows Server 2012R2, 
enable Protected Process Light for Local Security Authority (LSA).  
o Refrain from storing plaintext credentials in scripts . 
 Implement time -based access for accounts set at the admin level and higher  [CPG 2.A , 2.E ]. For 
example, the Just -in-Time (JIT) access method provisions privileged access when needed and can 
support enforcement of the principle of least privilege (as well as the Zero Trust model). This is a process where a network -wide policy is set in place to automatically disable admin accounts at the 
AD level when the account is not in direct need. Individual users may submit their requests through an automated process that grants them access to a specified system for a set timeframe when 
they need to support the completion of a certain task.  
In addition, FBI, CISA, and ASD’S ACSC  recommend network defenders apply the following mitigations to 
limit potential adversarial use of common system and network discovery techniques an d to reduce the 
impact and risk of compromise by ransomware or data extortion actors:  
 Implement a recovery plan  to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary data 
and servers in a physically separate, segmented, and secure location (e. g., hard drive, storage 
device, or the cloud).  
 Maintain offline backups of data , and regularly maintain backup and restoration (daily or weekly at 
minimum). By instituting this practice, an organization minimizes the impact of disruption to 
business practi ces as they will not be as severe and/or only have irretrievable data [ CPG 2.R ]. 
TLP: CLEAR 
FBI | CISA | ASD’s ACSC  
Page 17 of 23 | Product ID:  AA23 -136A  
TLP: CLEAR ASD’S ACSC  recommends organizations follow the 3 -2-1 backup strategy in which organizations 
have three copies of data (one copy of production data and two backup copies) on two different 
media such as disk and tape, with one copy kept off -site for disaster recovery.  
 Require all accounts with password login s (e.g., service account, admin accounts, and domain 
admin accounts) to comply with National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) standards  
for developing and managing password policies.  
o Use longer passwords consisting of at least 15 characters [ CPG 2.B ]. 
o Store passwords in hashed format using industry -recognized password managers.  
o Add password user “salts” to shared login credentials.  
o Avoid reusing passwords [ CPG 2.C ]. 
o Implement multiple failed login attempt account lockouts [ CPG 2.G ]. 
o Disable password “hints. ” 
o Refrain from requiring password changes more frequently than once per year.  
Note:  NIST guidance suggests favoring longer passwords instead of requiring regular and 
frequent password resets. Frequent password resets are more likely to result in users 
developing password “patterns” cyber criminals can easily decipher.  
o Require administrator credentials to install software.  
 Require phishing -resistant multifactor authentication  for all services to the extent possible, 
particularly for webmail, virtual private networks, and accounts that access critical systems [ CPG 
2.H]. 
 Keep all operating systems, software, and firmware up to date . Timely patching is one of the most 
efficient and cost -effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to cybersecurity 
threats. Organ izations should patch vulnerable software and hardware systems within 24 to 48 
hours from vulnerability disclosure. Prioritize patching known exploited vulnerabilities  in internet -
facing systems [ CPG 1.E ]. 
 Segment networks  to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can help prevent 
the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between —and access to —various 
subnetworks, restricting further lateral movement [ CPG 2.F ]. 
 Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the indicated 
ransomware with a networking monitoring tool . To aid in detecti ng ransomware, implement a tool 
that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral movement activity on a network. Endpoint 
detection and response (EDR) tools are particularly useful for detecting lateral connections, as they have insight into co mmon and uncommon network connections for each host [
CPG 3.A ]. 
 Install, regularly update, and enable real tim e detection for antivirus software  on all hosts.  
 Disable unused ports  [CPG 2.V ]. 
 Consider adding an e mail banner to emails  received from outside your organization [ CPG 2.M ]. 
TLP: CLEAR 
FBI | CISA | ASD’s ACSC  
Page 18 of 23 | Product ID:  AA23 -136A  
TLP: CLEAR  Ensure all backup data is encrypted, immutable  (i.e., cannot be altered or deleted), and covers the 
entire organization’s data infrastructure [ CPG 2.K , 2.L, 2.R ]. 
Validate Security Controls  
In addition to applying mitigations, FBI, CISA, and ASD ’S ACSC  recommend exercising, testing , and 
validating your organization's security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK 
for Enterprise framework in this advisory. FBI, CISA, and ASD ’S ACSC  recommend testing your existing 
security controls inventory to assess how they perf orm against the ATT&CK techniques described in this 
advisory.  
To get started:  
1. Select an ATT&CK technique described in this advisory (see  Table 2  to Table 14 ). 
2. Align your security technologies against the technique.  
3. Test your technologies against the technique.  
4. Analyze your detection and prevention t echnologies’ performance.  
5. Repeat the process for all security technologies to obtain a set of comprehensive performance 
data.  
6. Tune your security program, including people, processes, and technologies, based on the data 
generated by this process.  
FBI, CISA, and ASD ’S ACSC recommend continually testing your security program, at scale, in a production 
environment to ensure optimal performance against the MITRE ATT&CK techniques identified in this advisory.
