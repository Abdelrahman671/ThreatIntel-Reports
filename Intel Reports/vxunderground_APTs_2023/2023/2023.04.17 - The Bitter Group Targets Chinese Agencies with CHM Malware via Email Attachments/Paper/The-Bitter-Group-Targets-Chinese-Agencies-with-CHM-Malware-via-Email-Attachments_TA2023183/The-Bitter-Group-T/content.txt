Attack Details
#1
The Bitter group is an attack group that targets government agencies
in South Asia and has been using Office documents to distribute
malicious codes. Recently, they have been distributing CHM malware
to specific organizations in China through email attachments with
compressed CHM files.
The CHM files create empty help windows or contain information
related to “China Central United Front Department” and “China-Russia
Peace and Development Committee”. The files execute malicious
scripts that create tasks to execute malicious commands and access
and download additional malicious files.
The loaded malicious DLL collects user information and creates a task
for persistence. The malicious scripts within the CHM files are difficult
for users to recognize, as the Click method that executes the shortcut
object is obfuscated. The malware also tries to connect to C2 for
various malicious actions.
