22.04.2022 16:58
The Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) has recorded 802 cyber attacks in Q1
2022. A year ago, 362 cyberattacks were recorded in the same period.
Five groups that have waged the largest number of cyber attacks on Ukraineâ€™s critical IT infrastructure
include hackers, whose activities are associated with the aggressor country or Belarus as its accomplice
in the war against our homeland:
1. UAC-0010 aka Armageddon (GammaLoad, GammaDrop, HarvesterX): APT (advanced persistent
threat), a group backed by the Russian FSB.
2. UAC-0041 (AgentTesla, XLoader): Russian hacktivists.
3. UAC-0056 (Pandora hVNC, RemoteUtilities, GrimPlant, GraphSteel): Russian hacktivists and cyber
spies.
4. UAC-0051 aka UNC1151: APT, a group allegedly linked to special services of the Republic of
Belarus.

5. UAC-0028 aka APT28: APT, a group allegedly linked to GRU (Main Intelligence Directorate) of the
Russian Federation.
UAC-0041 and UAC-0056, associated by the international community with Russian hacktivists, are the
ones being unusually active. They exploit the current military issues. Most likely, the Russian intelligence
service shares data with these groups.
