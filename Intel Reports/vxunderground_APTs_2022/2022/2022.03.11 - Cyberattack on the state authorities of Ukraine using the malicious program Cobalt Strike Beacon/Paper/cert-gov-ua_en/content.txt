Cyberattack on the state authorities of Ukraine using the
malicious program Cobalt Strike Beacon (CERT-UA # 4145)
General Information
The Governmental Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine CERT-UA received a notification
from the coordinating entities on the distribution of e-mails on behalf of the state bodies of Ukraine with
instructions on how to increase the level of information security. The body of the letter contains a link to
the website hxxps://forkscenter[.]fr/, from which it is proposed to download "critical updates" in the form of
a file "BitdefenderWindowsUpdatePackage.exe" of about 60 MB.
It was found that the mentioned file will ensure the execution of the bootloader "alt.exe", which will
download the files "one.exe" and "dropper.exe" from the Discord service and run them. The study found
that running "one.exe" would damage your computer with the malicious program Cobalt Strike Beacon.
The executable file "dropper.exe" will load base64-encoded data and decode it into an EXE file
developed using the Go programming language. File analysis continues. Note that EXE files are
protected by Themida protector.
We associate the detected activity with the activity of the UAC-0056 group with an average level of
confidence.
