CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS | CHINA
Executive Summary
The threat actor group Xiaoqiying (aka Genesis Day, Teng Snake) is a primarily Chinese-speaking threat
group that conducted website defacement and data exfiltration attacks on more than a dozen South
Korean research and academic institutions in late-January 2023. More recently, its affiliated threat
actors have signaled a new round of cyberattacks against organizations in Japan and Taiwan. Based on
the analysis of the group’s Telegram channels, postings on special-access forums, and its presence on
a clearnet website, we conclude that this is a hacktivist group primarily motivated by patriotism toward
China, and it will likely conduct similar cyberattacks against Western and NATO targets, as well as any
country or region deemed hostile to China.
Key Findings
●
The threat actor group operated primarily on 2 Telegram channels — an announcement channel
and a members channel under the moniker “Genesis Day” — until early February 2023, when
news about its cyberattacks in South Korea, which was conducted under the moniker of
“Xiaoqiying”, reached the media. The 2 Telegram groups then went offline.
●
Based on chat logs from the Telegram announcement channel, the group has been in operation
for much of 2022 and made unverified claims of compromising the networks of organizations in
the US, Ukraine, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, and other Western countries. The group also
claimed to have working relationships with APTs and threat groups around the world, giving it
the capacity to launch cyberattacks against any region deemed hostile to China.
●
The group maintains the clearnet website eisae[.]org to announce its activities, including
“Operation South Korea'', which allegedly compromised a number of South Korean organizations
beginning in late-January 2023. The website also provides contact information for membership
recruitment.
●
Sample data allegedly gathered from the attacks was shared on the now-defunct BreachForums
by “abort” and on Ramp Forum by “uetus”. Both actors claimed to operate on behalf of “Genesis
Day”; “abort” was banned due to complaints of file download links containing malware. More
recently, uetus also claimed to have penetrated an unnamed Japanese financial institution and
the National University of Taiwan as part of a new operation by Genesis Day.
●
Per its Telegram channel chat logs, the threat group likely exploits vulnerabilities in
internet-facing devices and remote access tools to gain initial access. In addition, allegedly
“cracked” versions of penetration tools, including Cobalt Strike, Brute Ratel, Burp Suite, as well
as proof-of-concept code (POC) for exploits and other malware, were shared across the threat
group’s Telegram channels.
●
The chat logs on the 2 Telegram channels did not reveal clear ties with the Chinese government,
but reflected a strong pro-China and anti-West sentiment. In addition, the threat group does not
appear to be financially motivated, as it did not seek profit from data and access sales.

Background
Since January 25, 2023, open-source reporting from South Korea has revealed a mass cyberattack
against websites belonging to 12 South Korean research and academic institutions during the Lunar
New Year holiday. The cyberattack was conducted by a Chinese-speaking threat group identified as 晓
骑营(pronounced “Xiaoqiying” and translates to “Dawn Cavalry”). According to a report from Gnews
(gnews.org), the Korea Internet & Security Agency (KISA) identified the affected research and academic
institutions, which include the Korean Research Institute for Construction Policy, Korean Archaeological
Society, Woorimal Academic Society, Korean Academy of Basic Medicine & Health Science, Association
for Studies in Parents and Guardians, Research Institute for Early Childhood Education, Korean Lesson
Study Group for Social Studies, Korean East-West Mind Science Association, Korean Cleft Lip and
Palate Association, Korean Association for the Education and Rehabilitation of the Blind and Visually
Impaired, Jeju Education & Science Research Institute, and the Korean Society for the Study of
Educational Principles.
According to KISA reports, all 12 of the abovementioned websites suffered website defacements in
which the adversaries replaced each hosted website with their own in a compromised server. The
compromised websites either had a generic error page or a claim, including the threat group’s name
written in Chinese characters (晓骑营), that the threat group had compromised and invaded the “Korean
Internet”. KISA also identified IP addresses linked with the attack to origins within various countries
such as China, the US, Singapore, and Taiwan. Based on a report from The Korea Times
(koreatimes.co.kr), the Chinese threat group disclosed on its public Telegram channel that it included
KISA as one of its potential targets and is the first government agency targeted by the threat group.
Other reports claimed that the threat group threatened to target approximately 2,000 government
agencies, including South Korea’s Ministry of Culture, Sports, and Tourism.
Since then, reports disclosed that some websites had recovered from the website defacement attacks.
However, Xiaoqiying announced that they had stolen a total of 54 gigabytes of data from various
organizations, including the institutes' staff members and researchers' personally identifiable
information (PII). An investigation is currently underway, and KISA has not officially confirmed whether
the hackers are Chinese or have links to the Chinese government.
Our initial tracking of the threat group came from its 2 Telegram channels, in which the group was
known as “Genesis Day”. One of the administrators of those Telegram groups had 晓骑营(Xiaoqiying) as
part of their handle as well as an associated GitHub page. Since the Chinese characters 晓骑营
(Xiaoqiying) were used as the group’s moniker in the website defacement attacks in South Korea, the
group is now better known by the new name instead.

Threat Analysis
Telegram Groups
Our analysis of Xiaoqiying’s activity on Telegram is based on 2 Telegram invitation links obtained in
1
early January 2023. One of these links was for the announcement channel and the other was for the
communications channel. By joining the 2 Telegram channels, we downloaded the chat logs and the
files shared. From analyzing the downloaded data, we identified the threat group’s administrators, tools
and data shared among members, tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the threat group,
and connections with other special-access cybercriminal forums and threat actors. We also assessed
the credibility of the offers and predicted the future course of action of the group.
The Genesis Day threat group was active on Telegram up until February 2023 when the news of its
alleged breaches reached the media. Then, both Telegram channels went offline. These 2 Telegram
channels included an announcement channel and a member channel. Both channels consisted primarily
of Chinese-speaking users.

This channel was created on August 16, 2021, and had more than 700 subscribers as of mid-January
2023. We obtained leaked data, tools, malware source codes and samples, files related to US
government entities, credit card data, and more from the group’s Telegram channel. Files of interest that
were shared in the group include the following:
●
Allegedly cracked versions of Cobalt Strike, Brute Ratel, and Burp Suite
●
A list of offers from “johnhana”, a highly credible member of the now-defunct BreachForums who
frequently posted China-related data leaks
●
A speculative report on the members of “AgainstTheWest”, a threat group targeting Russia,
China, Iran, and North Korea that was active on both BreachForums and Raid Forums, a
now-defunct predecessor to BreachForums
●
A list of information about the alleged members of “Killnet”, a pro-Russian hacktivist group that
has been active since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022
●
Alleged source code of BPFDoor malware from Red Menshen
●
PHP Library Remote Code Access (RCE) proof of concept, which includes a link shared on
Packet Storm Security
●
A database from WeLeakInfo[.]com containing credit card information and Stripe accounts
In addition, proofs of concept and exploits of the following CVEs were shared in the announcement:
●
CVE-2022-34305 (Apache Tomcat vulnerability)
●
CVE-2022-20006 (Android vulnerability)
●
CVE-2022-34918 (Debian and Linux vulnerabilities)
●
CVE-2021-23017 (Fedora operating system vulnerability)
These proofs of concept and exploits may have been used in compromising some of the websites listed
in Appendix B as some of those websites have PHP or Apache servers that might have been
unpatched.
Xiaoqiying’s administrators also recruited on the Telegram channels, requesting skilled members
interested in joining the collective to send their resumes to ADKF3R@proton[.]me. Appendix A includes
a complete list of the files shared in the Telegram channel.
The chat log consists entirely of announcements from the administrator “Genesis Day” as other users
appeared to be muted. Analysis of these announcements showed a strong pro-China, anti-West
sentiment. On December 31, 2022, Genesis Day posted a new year’s message, shown in Figure 2 and
translated on the following page.

Figure 3: Genesis Day member’s channel (Source: Telegram)
The channel was created on December 27, 2022 and has 90 members as of mid-January 2023. Most of
the conversations in the Telegram channel appear to be discussions on cybersecurity and geopolitical
issues. The channel has 2 administrators: “Сергей” (Sergei), with the personal Telegram handle
@rebook_cc, and “晓骑营openAI” (Xiaoqiying openAI), with the personal Telegram handle
@TeteeserisBot. 晓骑营openAI also maintained a personal GitHub account at tubosheu.github[.]io,
which went offline in early February 2023. On January 7, 2023, the threat actor posted the following
statement on their GitHub page: “We plan to start a new round of operations against South Korea, and
this will result in long-term data leakage. This operation will be long-lasting, and it will be updated on
the official blog in lock-step.”

appear to be South Korean nationals, with some of the listed email addresses having South Korean
corporate domains for South Korean companies. The GitHub page went offline in early February 2023
along with both Telegram channels.

Dark Web and Special-Access Forums
On January 17, 2023, abort, a member of the now-defunct BreachForums, claimed that the Genesis Day
threat group had hacked into the internal FTP service and the internal employee systems of the
Samsung Group intranet due to South Korean cooperation with NATO and targeting Russia, Iran, and
China. The threat actor shared alleged intrusion credentials in an Anonfiles link and claimed that the
threat group would disclose Samsung Group's business data files in France, internal material flow
analysis (MFA) flow chart, internal demonstration video, and the procedures for Samsung's internal
system login, intranet system employee access credentials, and all Samsung employee credentials. The
threat actor registered for an account on BreachForums on October 16, 2022, and had made 9 posts up
to that point. However the account was permanently banned on BreachForums after several replies
complained that the anonfiles link shared by the threat actor contained malware.
Figure 5: The screenshot shows that the threat actor abort was banned on BreachForums for posting the link to Samsung files
that allegedly contained malware (Source: BreachForums)
On the same day, the threat actor uetus, who also claimed to operate under Genesis Day, made a
similar post with an identical file download link on Ramp Forum. However, most of the replies
complained that the link provided by the threat actor was not working. On February 16, 2023, uetus
made a reference about being banned on BreachForums but also noted that new operations on South
Korea are being planned.
On March 12, 2023, uetus made a post claiming to have penetrated a Japanese financial group and
offering to sell access along with data from the customer and business system, which includes intranet
access and customer loan data from 2001 to the present, as well as loan records with dozens of listed

companies. On March 22, 2023, “Liltys”, who had previously posted about selling ESXiArgs ransomware
builders, asked uetus if they could work together to deploy EXSiArgs ransomware.
On April 5, 2023, uetus made another post on the Ramp Forum claiming to have compromised “Taiwan
University'' and leaked 25 GB of its data. Once again uterus claimed to operate on behalf of Genesis
Day and stated that the motivation for the attack was due to the strengthening of cooperation between
Taiwan and NATO. They claimed to have compromised the university’s internal network twice, gained
access to the intranet, and shared a sample of the stolen data on the forum. The threat actor also
stated that they would continue targeting Taiwan for the foreseeable future. The claim by uetus is
consistent with the “Genesis Day 2022 Activity Summary” stated above in which they claimed to have
achieved “penetration into a well-known higher education institute in Taiwan, and successfully obtained
intranet access” in December 2022. Further examination of the screenshots shared by uetus shows the
domain of vdi.ntu.edu[.]tw, which indicates the university in reference is likely the National Taiwan
University, and the threat actors likely gained access to the Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI).
Another screenshot shows a TeamViewer remote control terminal, which means the threat actor might
have gained access through a TeamViewer vulnerability.

Clearnet
The Xiaoqiying group maintains a clearnet website, eisae[.]org, which acts as its public-facing
announcement channel. The website shares the same logo as the GitHub page of 晓骑营openAI that
went offline in early February 2023. Whois data shows that the domain was created on January 5,
2023. Live DNS lookup in Recorded Future shows that the domain resolves to 2 Cloudflare IP
addresses: 172.67.139[.]24 and 104.21.87[.]2. DomainTools hosting history shows that on January 6,
2023, the domain changed from 34.102.136[.]180 to the current Cloudflare IP addresses. The IP address
34.102.136[.]180 shows a high malicious risk score of 89 on Recorded Future and was last associated
with APT36’s data exfiltration campaign targeting military and political users with Android malware.
At the time of this report, there are 7 announcements on the website. The “first published” date appears
to pre-date the creation of this website. Recorded Future downloaded the data via the links included in
the announcements, but we were unable to verify whether they were from the organizations they
allegedly belong to or came from earlier data breaches.

Outlook
Xiaoqiying/Genesis Day threat group appears to be an ideologically driven hacktivist group that is not
chiefly concerned with financial gains. The group claimed to be responsible for some unverified
cyberattacks before the confirmed intrusions against numerous South Korean organizations in January
and February 2023. As a result, we rate its credibility as moderate. It shared available penetration
testing tools, malware, proofs of concept and exploits, and leaked data, and it claimed to have working
relationships with some well-known cybercriminal and APT groups around the world. The group
appears to be ambitious and is actively recruiting individuals with hacking skills.
Although it shows no clear ties to the Chinese government, Xiaoqiying is staunchly pro-China and vows
to target NATO countries as well as any country or region that is deemed hostile to China. The most
recent postings by its affiliated threat actors on special-access forums shows it has possibly
compromised new targets in Japan and Taiwan and signaled a new round of cyberattacks against these
countries. We recommend that organizations that are possibly targeted by this group, especially
education, research, and government organizations in the Asian Pacific region, maintain a frequent
patching cadence for their internet-facing devices and disable any unnecessary remote access tools.
We will continue to monitor the activity of this group.
