Suspected Mysterious Elephant organization uses CHM files
to attack many countries in South Asia
Gang background
Mysterious Elephant is a South Asian APT organization named by the foreign s
ecurity manufacturer Kaspersky in the APT trend report for the second quarter of
2023 
[1]
 . Domestic merchants have disclosed that the new backdoor ORPCBackdo
or belonging to the Bitter organization appeared in the mysterious attack activitie
s 
[2, 3]
 . Considering the possible differences in attribution, the merchants also ch
ose to use ORPCBackdoor. The backdoor gang is given a new number different fro
m the Bitter organization for tracking. According to the current public informatio
n, the Mysterious Elephant organization is associated with multiple APT organizati
ons in South Asia, especially the attack methods of the Bitter organization are si
milar. The group's targets include Pakistan and other countries.
Event overview
QiAnXin Threat Intelligence Center recently discovered a batch of special CHM
files. The script content of the html file is very simple and only executes an extern
al file (such as "UsoCoreService" in the picture below). Since the CHM script itself
does not contain obvious malicious code, the number of reported viruses on VT fo
r these samples is very low.

The CHM sample contains image bait, combined with the ".pdf.chm" double e
xtension in the file name, disguised as a PDF file. The bait content is related to Pa
kistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar and other South Asian countries, involving governm
ent agencies, military, diplomacy, economy, etc. industry. During the sample corr
elation process, we also found that the attacker imitated the red team’s technique
s to create phishing samples, and the bait content indicated that the target of the
attack was the Pakistani defense military department.
The external file executed by CHM is actually a backdoor written in C#. The ba
ckdoor code is similar to the malicious sample involved in a report 
[4]
 that disclos
ed the Bitter organization's attack arsenal . The server mentioned in this report (l
ibraofficeonline[.]com) used to store attack weapons is also related to Mysterious
Elephant. Some of the attack weapons hosted on it are the disclosed Mysterious E
lephant malware 
[5]
 (including ORPCBackdoor, WalkerShell, DemoTrySpy etc.).
Due to the intricate connections between APT organizations in South Asia and
the different tracking perspectives of multiple security researchers, there is curre
ntly no consensus in the industry on whether to distinguish Mysterious Elephant f
rom Bitter. In order to avoid introducing more differences, this article believes tha
t these special CHM attack samples and C# backdoors are likely to come from the
Mysterious Elephant organization based on the similarity of malicious samples.
Detailed analysis
The CHM sample information is as follows, some of which have been previousl
y disclosed by other security researchers

Fishing sample structure
According to disclosed samples 
[8, 9]
 , attackers deliver phishing samples in e
ncrypted compressed packages. Both the CHM file and the C# backdoor exist in th
e compressed package, but the C# backdoor sets the file hidden attribute, causin
g the victim to only see the CHM file after decompression. Even if some security-c
onscious victims will use anti-virus software to scan CHM files, since the CHM files
themselves do not carry too many malicious scripts, they are likely to be judged a
s safe, causing the victims to directly open the bait CHM files and start the hidden
C# back door.
C# backdoor
The C# backdoor uses Task asynchronous programming, part of which is pack
ed with ConfuserEx. The function is relatively simple, mainly executing cmd comm
ands issued by the C2 server. Some backdoors also support other attack command
s.
Get C2
There are different ways for C# backdoors to obtain C2 server information, in‐
cluding the following.
(1) C2 server information is directly hard-coded in the code.
(2) Decrypt from the configuration file.
For example, 00f2df1829893caa85f3968961b6e736 and 316e8d798f7db625c20
7532e2f7a5d38 both read the SysConfig.enc file in the same directory, and then u
se AES to decrypt to obtain the C2 server information.
(3) Disguised as a seemingly legitimate network service access request, parse
d from the response content of the remote server.
Taking a3a06d50438681fc9917e22c41bd2cab as an example, the GetIpInfo fun
ction requests "hxxp://easyiplookup.com:5080/main/get_ip_data?userId=zqlCYqgp
4f&ip=8.8.8.8"
Extract the content from the RequestId field of the response content, and bas
e64 decode it to obtain the C2 information "91.132.92.231:5959". In addition to po
rt 5959, port 6060 of the same IP (91.132.92.231) was also found to be passed as
C2 information to the C# backdoor. This way, the attacker has the flexibility to cha
nge the C2 server IP address and port to which the backdoor actually connects.
Port 80 of the easyiplookup.com domain name seems to be running an IP que
ry service. The website script custom.js calls the fetchIpInfo function to obtain th
e visitor's IP information from ip-api.com and displays it on the page. After clickin
g the IP lookup button "Lookup" on the web page and submitting the form, the sa
me URL as the backdoor requesting C2 information ("hxxp://easyiplookup.com:50
80/main/get_ip_data") will be accessed, indicating that the website is under the co
ntrol of the attacker. Down.
Other C# backdoors that use the same method to obtain C2 information inclu

Both winfreecloud.net and easyiplookup.com resolve to the same IPs (151.23

Backdoor functionality
The backdoor uses the hostname and username of the infected device as victi
m identification information after connecting to the C2 server.
The function of most backdoors is only to execute remote commands or creat
e a cmd.exe shell for attackers to perform subsequent operations.
Some backdoors also support other C2 commands.

The above-mentioned related samples can be divided into two categories. Sa
mples 1 to 4 use resume documents as bait, the backdoor is written in C++, and u
ses Tencent Cloud services as C2. They are attack samples of domestic red teams.
The decoy PDF content of Samples 5 and 6 is related to the Pakistan Defense
Military. The C# backdoor (MD5: 5e7dba4aafb8176ab026e2f4aa3211dd) code is co
nsistent with the backdoor related to the CHM file mentioned earlier. The connect
ed C2 server information is also decrypted from the configuration file "license" th
rough AES. ” obtained from . The configuration files of the two compressed packa
ges are the same, and the C2 is 158.255.215.115:443.
Based on the upload time of these samples on VT and the file timestamp in th
e compressed package, we believe that the attacker imitated the attack samples t
argeting Pakistan based on the public red team phishing samples.
Attack attribution
The C# backdoor is similar to the malicious sample hosted in the op directory
on the libraofficeonline[.]com server mentioned in the report 
[4] .
Taking the backdoor a59fe2c89b0000a360a8468f2b990c73 as an example, ma
lware similar to this sample in the op directory is shown in the table below. The si
milarities include: using Task asynchronous programming, sending the machine n
ame and user name to the C2 server as the victim identification, using similar fun
ction names and Output information string.

Since ORPCBackdoor was initially considered to be a new backdoor of the Bitt
er organization, some domestic and foreign security vendors later used ORPCBack
door's group to track the new organization Mysterious Elephant. This may be the
reason for the above attribution inconsistency. This article is consistent with prev
ious open source reports disclosing ORPCBackdoor attack activities and avoid intr
oducing more differences. Therefore, it is believed that the CHM files and C# bac
kdoors targeting many South Asian countries are likely to originate from the Myst
erious Elephant organization.
Summarize
The CHM samples related to this attack targeted Pakistan, Bangladesh and ot
her places in South Asia, involving government agencies, national defense and mi
litary, diplomatic and other departments. The attacker used a less common attack
method using CHM samples, that is, the CHM file directly launches an external file
without other malicious code. External files related to CHM are all C# backdoors.
Some C# backdoors disguise requests to obtain C2 address information as access
to seemingly legitimate network services, and then parse the C2 address from the
response results. The attackers also imitated red team attack samples and used t
he same C# backdoor. The above signs indicate that the attack group has been tr
ying different attack methods and working hard to disguise the attack activities.
