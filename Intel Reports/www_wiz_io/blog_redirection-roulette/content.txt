-top-20"></a>TL;DR</h1><p class="">In the last few months we have been investigating a large scale cyber operation leveraging legitimate FTP credentials obtained via an unknown threat vector. In many cases, these were highly secure auto-generated FTP credentials which the attacker was somehow able to acquire and leverage for website hijacking. We are publishing our findings regardless, and would be happy to collaborate on this research, as this is still ongoing activity.</p><h1><div class=""></div><a id="executive-summary-2" class="relative -top-20"></a>Executive summary</h1><p class="">Since early September 2022, an unknown threat actor has successfully compromised tens of thousands of websites mainly aimed at East Asian audiences, redirecting hundreds of thousands of their users to adult-themed content. In each case, the threat actor has injected malicious code into customer-facing web pages that is designed to collect information about visitors’ environments and occasionally redirect them to these other sites, depending on both random chance and the country in which the user is located.</p><p class="">The compromised websites include many owned by small companies and several operated by multinational corporations. They are diverse in terms of their tech stacks and hosting services, making it difficult to pinpoint any specific vulnerability, misconfiguration, or source of leaked credentials this threat actor may be abusing. In several cases, including a honeypot we set up to investigate this activity, the threat actor connected to the target web server using legitimate FTP credentials they somehow obtained previously.</p><p class="">While we were not able to determine how this threat actor has been gaining initial access to the affected web servers or where they are sourcing their stolen credentials from, we&#x27;ve decided to publish our findings regardless, in order to bring more awareness to this ongoing activity. Given the nature of the destination websites, we believe the threat actor’s motivations are most likely financial, and perhaps they intend to merely increase traffic to these websites from specific countries and nothing more. However, the impact to the compromised websites and their user experience is equivalent to defacement, and whatever weaknesses this actor is exploiting to gain initial access to these websites could be utilized by other actors to inflict greater harm.</p><p class="">If you maintain your website via FTP, we recommend using FTPS or SFTP with a strong username and password combination. If you identify any IOCs related to this activity in your environment, you should rotate your credentials, reinstall software from a trusted source, and restore compromised assets to previous clean versions.</p><p class="">Please feel free to reach out to Wiz Threat Research at <a target="_blank" href="mailto:threat.hunters@wiz.io">threat.hunters@wiz.io</a> if you’ve been impacted by this activity or wish to exchange information that might assist in ongoing analysis.</p><figure><button type="button" class="w-full cursor-zoom-in"><div style="aspect-ratio:1.2633473305338931" class="relative overflow-hidden rounded-md sm:rounded-xl w-full shadow-md sm:shadow-xl"><div class="z-[1]" style="overflow:hidden;position:absolute;left:0;top:0;width:100%;height:100%;max-width:none;max-height:none"><img aria-hidden="true" alt="" src="data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQAAAQABAAD/2wCEAAoHBwgHEAcNBwcQBgcHDRgLBwYJDhEVDRENFx8ZGBYTFhUaHysjGh0oKRUiJTUlKC0vMjIyGSI4PTcwPCsxMi8BCgsLDg0OHBAQGi8cFhwvLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vL//AABEIABMAGAMBIgACEQEDEQH/xAAXAAEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgEH/8QAFRABAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH/xAAXAQADAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQID/8QAGBEBAAMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECMRH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AOuViqkl1xsGwJEzHW1IAVxUADOdf//Z" style="transition:opacity 500ms;opacity:1;position:absolute;left:-5%;top:-5%;width:110%;height:auto;max-width:none;max-height:none"/><noscript><picture><source srcSet="https://www.datocms-assets.com/75231/1677768423-5.png?dpr=0.25&amp;fm=webp 526w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/75231/1677768423-5.png?dpr=0.5&amp;fm=webp 1053w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/75231/1677768423-5.png?dpr=0.75&amp;fm=webp 1579w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/75231/1677768423-5.png?fm=webp 2106w" sizes="(max-width: 2106px) 100vw, 2106px" type="image/webp"/><source srcSet="https://www.datocms-assets.com/75231/1677768423-5.png?dpr=0.25&amp;fm=webp 526w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/75231/1677768423-5.png?dpr=0.5&amp;fm=webp 1053w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/75231/1677768423-5.png?dpr=0.75&amp;fm=webp 1579w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/75231/1677768423-5.png?fm=webp 2106w" sizes="(max-width: 2106px) 100vw, 2106px"/><img src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/75231/1677768423-5.png?fm=webp" alt="Summary of investigation findings" title="Summary of investigation findings" style="position:absolute;left:0;top:0;width:100%;height:100%;max-width:none;max-height:none" loading="lazy"/></picture></noscript></div></div></button><figcaption class="mt-5 block px-8 text-center text-sm">Summary of investigation findings</figcaption></figure><h1><div class=""></div><a id="introduction-9" class="relative -top-20"></a>Introduction</h1><p class="">In early October 2022, as part of our work with customers to investigate threats to their cloud environments, we learned of several compromised Azure Web Apps hosted in East Asia that were redirecting users to an adult website. In each of these cases, an FTP endpoint used for managing the web application was accessed by an unknown actor using legitimate credentials (long and complex passwords which were unlikely to have been included as part of a brute-force dictionary attack). The actor modified existing web pages and added a single line of HTML code, in the form of a script tag referencing a remotely hosted JavaScript script. In multiple cases, based on an analysis of relevant FTP logs, the actor was connecting to these FTP endpoints from a static IP address (<code>172.81.104[.]64</code>).</p><figure><button type="button" class="w-full cursor-zoom-in"><div style="aspect-ratio:3.811320754716981" class="relative overflow-hidden rounded-md sm:rounded-xl w-full"><div class="z-[1]" style="overflow:hidden;position:absolute;left:0;top:0;width:100%;height:100%;max-width:none;max-height:none"><img aria-hidden="true" alt="" src="data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQAAAQABAAD/2wCEAAoHBwgHBhEICAgLCgoLDhIQFQ0NDhEOFhUNFxUZGBYVFh0aHysjGh0oHRUWJDUlKC0vMjIyGSI4PTcwPCsxMi8BCgsLDggOHA8NEC8dFh07Ly8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vL//AABEIAAcAGAMBIgACEQEDEQH/xAAYAAEAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwUHAf/EABwQAAIBBQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAwIEEiEiEf/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEA/8QAFBEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8A02CdWmqUWFvLXN0AJTJvLxnACT//2Q==" style="transition:opacity 500ms;opacity:1;position:absolute;left:-5%;top:-5%;width:110%;height:auto;max-width:none;max-height:none"/><noscript><picture><source srcSet="https://www.datocms-assets.com/75231/1677768399-1.png?dpr=0.25&amp;fm=webp 404w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/75231/1677768399-1.png?dpr=0.5&amp;fm=webp 808w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/75231/1677768399-1.png?dpr=0.75&amp;fm=webp 1212w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/75231/1677768399-1.png?fm=webp 1616w" sizes="(max-width: 1616px) 100vw, 1616px" type="image/webp"/><source srcSet="https://www.datocms-assets.com/75231/1677768399-1.png?dpr=0.25&amp;fm=webp 404w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/75231/1677768399-1.png?dpr=0.5&amp;fm=webp 808w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/75231/1677768399-1.png?dpr=0.75&amp;fm=webp 1212w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/75231/1677768399-1.png?fm=webp 1616w" sizes="(max-width: 1616px) 100vw, 1616px"/><img src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/75231/1677768399-1.png?fm=webp" alt="Redirection flow of visitors to compromised websites" title="Redirection flow of visitors to compromised websites" style="position:absolute;left:0;top:0;width:100%;height:100%;max-width:none;max-height:none" loading="lazy"/></picture></noscript></div></div></button><figcaption class="mt-5 block px-8 text-center text-sm">Redirection flow of visitors to compromised websites</figcaption></figure><p class="">As we investigated further, we discovered that these seemingly isolated cases were actually part of a much larger set of campaigns that has successfully compromised thousands of websites, including several operated by large multinational corporations and aimed at East Asian audiences. Based on data from <a target="_blank" href="https://publicwww.com/">publicwww</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.similarweb.com/">SimiliarWeb</a>, we propose a conservative estimate of at least 10,000 compromised websites at the time of writing (not counting subdomains), redirecting hundreds of thousands of users in total every month. These websites are highly diverse in terms of their underlying technologies and hosting services, and in fact only a small fraction of them are Azure Web Apps.</p><p class="">Given the method of redirection and the nature of the destination websites, we initially assumed this to be a case of defacement, but we’ve since considered the possibility that the goal might be ad fraud, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spamdexing">SEO manipulation</a>, or perhaps simply driving inorganic traffic to these websites. We have not observed any signs of phishing, web skimming, or malware infection, and have yet to identify any evidence that could shed light on the threat actor’s precise motivations.</p><p class="">We have concluded that this activity most likely began in early September 2022 (based on domain registration dates and victim reporting) and involved continuously hacking web servers, collecting information about their visitors, and only sometimes redirecting them to other websites with adult or gambling content.</p><h1><div class=""></div><a id="technical-details-15" class="relative -top-20"></a>Technical details</h1><p class="">Websites compromised by this threat actor are modified to include one of several JavaScript tags (though in some cases malicious JavaScript is injected directly into existing files on the server, as explained below).

Additionally, the JavaScript tag is nearly always added to the end of the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of HTML pages or as the last line in JavaScript files. We have also witnessed bugs in this process, such as tags being added to the end of binary files like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/1294409f7ec5fb9ddd12fe3891533eb5b78ff7fd86469c5d08220cb6ef2b66d1/">videos</a> (where they would have no effect).</p><p class="">We have also identified a <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/soccerproject2022/football/commit/5615434012ebe1f3c461b602ce65de763321a371">GitHub project</a> that seems to have been similarly compromised, in which a commit added two variants of the malicious JavaScript tag to various pages. This may imply that the threat actor has been attempting to gain illicit access to code repositories in an effort to infect any associated websites.</p><p class="">The malicious hosts are all fronted by Cloudflare and geofenced to restrict execution of the JavaScript script to users connecting from certain countries in East Asia. Additionally, the script uses a common web cloaking technique of matching visitors’ user agents and referrers to a list of known web crawlers and search engines (like GoogleBot or Baidu) and ignoring such requests. However, this does not prevent these web crawlers from indexing the added line of malicious code in compromised websites, which has made it easier for us to identify them.</p><p class="">So far, we have surfaced numerous servers we assess to be associated with this activity, each of which hosts a variation of the aforementioned JavaScript script while masquerading as a legitimate URL (usually by changing the top-level domain):</p><div class="max-w-[90vw] overflow-x-auto"><table class="my-8 md:my-14"><thead><tr><th class="border-r pl-3 align-top font-sans !text-base last-of-type:border-r-0">Malicious URL</th><th class="border-r pl-3 align-top font-sans !text-base last-of-type:border-r-0">Legitimate URL</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="even:bg-gray-light/50"><td class="border-r pl-3 font-sans last-of-type:border-r-0"><span>tpc.googlesyndication[.]wiki/sodar/sodar2.js</span></td><td class="border-r pl-3 font-sans last-of-type:border-r-0"><span>tpc.googlesyndication.com/sodar/sodar2.js</span></td></tr><tr class="even:bg-gray-light/50"><td class="border-r pl-3 font-sans last-of-type:border-r-0"><span>beacon-v2.helpscout[.]help/static/js/vendor.06c7227b.js</span></td><td class="border-r pl-3 font-sans last-of-type:border-r-0"><span>beacon-v2.helpscout.net/static/js/vendor.06c7227b.js</span></td></tr><tr class="even:bg-gray-light/50"><td class="border-r pl-3 font-sans last-of-type:border-r-0"><span>cdn.jsdelivr[.]autos/npm/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js (currently offline)</span></td><td class="border-r pl-3 font-sans last-of-type:border-r-0"><span>cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js</span></td></tr><tr class="even:bg-gray-light/50"><td class="border-r pl-3 font-sans last-of-type:border-r-0"><span>minjs[.]us/static/js/min.js (currently offline)</span></td><td class="border-r pl-3 font-sans last-of-type:border-r-0"><span>*/static/js/min.js</span></td></tr><tr class="even:bg-gray-light/50"><td class="border-r pl-3 font-sans last-of-type:border-r-0"><span>www.metamarket[.]quest/market.js</span></td><td class="border-r pl-3 font-sans last-of-type:border-r-0"><span>www.metamarket.com</span></td></tr><tr class="even:bg-gray-light/50"><td class="border-r pl-3 font-sans last-of-type:border-r-0"><span>cdn-go[.]net/vasdev/web_webpersistance_v2/v1.8.2/flog.core.min.js</span></td><td class="border-r pl-3 font-sans last-of-type:border-r-0"><span>cdn-go.cn/vasdev/web_webpersistance_v2/v1.8.2/flog.core.min.js</span></td></tr><tr class="even:bg-gray-light/50"><td class="border-r pl-3 font-sans last-of-type:border-r-0"><span>a.msstatic[.]net/main3/common/assets/template/head/ad.tmpl_a9b7.js</span></td><td class="border-r pl-3 font-sans last-of-type:border-r-0"><span>a.msstatic.com/huya/main3/*</span></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p class="">While we cannot be entirely sure that these are all part of the same activity cluster and operated by the same threat actor, the JavaScript scripts are all structured similarly, use comparable obfuscation techniques, and include uniquely identifiable strings (either plaintext or obfuscated), such as a list of crawlers to ignore (see next section).

When the script is executed, a random number between 0 and 1 is calculated, and if it evaluates to be less than the <code>probability</code> value, then a cookie is set on the user’s machine which is set to expire after 24 hours, and the user is then redirected to the destination website listed in the <code>srcAddress</code> field.</p></li><li><p class="my-0">If a cookie has already been set on the user’s machine, then the next time they visit any website compromised by the same variant, they are automatically redirected to the destination website listed in the <code>srcAddress</code> field, while ignoring the <code>probability</code> field value (therefore one might be inclined to call this a “fortune cookie”). Different script variants sometime use different names for their cookies (observed examples include <code>qwertvy</code> and <code>bdstatics</code>).</p></li><li><p class="my-0">Interestingly, if the user is using an Android browser and the <code>config.androidApk</code> flag is enabled in the script, then rather than redirecting the user to the website listed in the <code>srcAddress</code> field, the user is instead redirected to the resource listed in the <code>downloadSrc</code> field. In the samples we have analyzed, these have either been <code>googleplay[.]com/chrome.apk</code> or <code>google[.]com/google.apk</code> (depending on the variant). Note that neither of these resources actually exists, and we have never seen a variant with <code>config.anrdoidApk</code> enabled.

This information was encoded in Base64 and summarized in JSON (formatted as <code>{“mydata”:$data}</code>). The script would use a POST request to upload the JSON to an API endpoint on the attacker-controlled host (<code>/top/record/addRecord</code>). The server would then respond with JSON that included further instructions (formatted as <code>{&quot;code&quot;:$code,&quot;msg&quot;:$message,&quot;data&quot;:$data}</code>). However, this behavior doesn’t occur in the current set of scripts – since Dec. 2022, the script no longer uploads any data to the server via POST, and some of the relevant functions have been deleted (newer variants no longer include <code>detectOS</code>, <code>detectBrowser</code>, <code>getCurrentDate</code>, <code>getLanguage</code>, or <code>isPC</code> functions).</p><p class="">Besides adding or removing functionality, the threat actor has also made additional modifications to the malicious script, some of which appear to be in response to detection. For example, the script hosted at <code>metamarket[.]quest</code> has gone through multiple iterations, initially using one method of obfuscation and a redirection probability of 30% (as of Sept. 2022), but later switching to a different obfuscation method and reducing the probability to 10% (as of Dec. 2022). Interestingly, the script hosted at <code>helpscout[.]help</code> currently has its probability set to 0%, meaning that no users to infected websites are currently being redirected.</p><p class="">Notably, several samples related to this activity were uploaded to VirusTotal during this period and detected by a THOR APT Scanner <a target="_blank" href="https://valhalla.nextron-systems.com/info/rule/SUSP_JS_OBFUSC_Base64_Combo_Jul22_1">YARA rule</a>, and subsequently (in late Nov. 2022) the threat actor changed their MO: in some cases, besides adding JavaScript tags to existing files on the compromised server, they began directly injecting obfuscated JavaScript code into certain files (we observed this behavior on our honeypot as well). We assess that this might be because some THOR APT YARA rules don’t scan samples <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Neo23x0/signature-base/blob/master/yara/gen_susp_js_obfuscatorio.yar">larger than 100KB</a>, but it could just as easily be a coincidence.</p><h1><div class=""></div><a id="destination-websites-34" class="relative -top-20"></a>Destination websites</h1><p class="">The websites to which users are redirected initially included <code>alivod1[.]com</code>, <code>22332299[.]com</code>, <code>alibb1[.]xyz</code>, and <code>alibb2[.]xyz</code> (阿里BB / 阿里巴巴 is Chinese shorthand for “Alibaba”).

We have since observed the threat actor connecting to it on multiple occasions from the aforementioned IP address (<code>172.81.104[.]64</code>). We have seen no indication the actor exploited any vulnerabilities on our machine – instead, they used a username and password combination associated with another unrelated server (this attempt was successful because we configured our honeypot to accept any FTP connections).

Although it&#x27;s unlikely that the threat actor is using a 0day vulnerability given the apparently low sophistication of the attack, we can’t rule this out as an option. It’s also possible that there is a commonality we have simply missed, such as misconfigured or vulnerable versions of specific server-side software, or perhaps vulnerable tools being used to manage the affected websites. The threat actor could also be utilizing data from password stealers or making use of leaked credentials, even though this wouldn’t quite explain how servers are being reinfected after password rotation. The threat actor would need to somehow set up backdoors for persistence, or compromise popular hosting services and exfiltrate customer credentials, such as in the recently disclosed <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/godaddy-hackers-stole-source-code-installed-malware-in-multi-year-breach/">GoDaddy breach</a>.</p><p class="">Despite our knowledge gaps about this threat activity, we&#x27;ve decided to publish our findings regardless, in order to bring more awareness to this ongoing activity, and in the hope that others in the security community can identify the initial access vector.</p><p class="">Given the nature of the destination websites, we believe the threat actor’s motivations are most likely financial, and perhaps they intend to merely increase traffic to these websites from specific countries and nothing more. However, the impact to the compromised websites and their user experience is equivalent to defacement, and whatever weaknesses this actor is exploiting to gain initial access to these websites could be utilized by other actors to inflict greater harm.
