Microsoft has observed the Iranian nation-state actor Peach Sandstorm attempting to deliver a newly developed backdoor
named FalseFont to individuals working for organizations in the Defense Industrial Base (DIB) sector. 
FalseFont is a custom backdoor with a wide range of functionalities that allow operators to remotely access an infected
