general information
The government team for responding to computer emergencies in Ukraine CERT-UA found
the file "dovidka.zip", which contains the contextual help file (Microsoft Compiled HTML
Help) "dovidka.chm". The mentioned CHM-file, in turn, contains the bait image "image.jpg"
(information on the procedure for frequent artillery shelling) and HTA-file "file.htm" with
malicious code in VBScript. Execution of the latter will lead to the creation on the computer
and run the dropper "ignit.vbs", which will decode the .NET loader "core.dll", as well as files
"desktop.ini" (run "core.dll" using regasm .exe) and "Windows Prefetch.lNk", which provides
the launch of the previously mentioned "desktop.ini" using wscript.exe.
Finally, the .NET loader will decode and execute the MicroBackdoor malware. Note that the
compilation dates of backdoor and loader are 28.01.2022 and 31.01.2022, respectively; in
addition, the domain used by the management server was created on 12.01.2022. It should be
added that in addition to the standard commands ("id", "info", "ping", "exit", "upd", "uninst",
"exec", "shell", "flist", "fget", "fput "), this version of the backdoor additionally implements
the" screenshot "command.
The activity is associated with the activities of the UAC-0051 group, also known as unc1151
(according to Mandiant).
