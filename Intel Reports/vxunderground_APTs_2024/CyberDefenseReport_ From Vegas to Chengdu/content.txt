Introduction 
The Chinese government has created an elaborate 
multifaceted “hack-for-hire” ecosystem that is unlike 
anything we have ever seen before. The system grants 
Chinese security agencies exclusive access to zero-day 
vulnerabilities (box 1) identified by China’s top civilian 
hackers, and allows Beijing to subsequently outsource 
its espionage operations to private contractors. The 
author’s understanding of the various facets of 
China’s hack-for-hire ecosystem draws from prior re-
search and sources, including: 
• 
1: Since 2014, the 
U.S. Department of Justice has been unveiling 
indictments against Chinese citizens engaged in 
malicious cyber activities, laying bare the inner 
workings and coordination of China’s offensive 
cyber ecosystem, which is characterized by a web 
of relationships between China’s intelligence 
agencies, private companies, and academia. 
• 
2: Since 2017, the 
anonymous group Intrusion Truth has exposed 
over 30 Chinese cyber operatives linked to six 
Advanced 
Persistent 
Threats 
(APTs). 
Predominantly 
based 
on 
open-source-
information, Intrusion Truth revealed connections 
between China’s IT sector, academia, and the 
nation’s intelligence agencies.  
• 
 This report showed how 
China’s military and intelligence agencies gain 
access to zero-day vulnerabilities discovered by 
private sector cybersecurity research teams. The 
report identified numerous Chinese companies 
that contribute feed vulnerabilities to China's 
intelligence apparatus. Based on the number of 
vulnerabilities 
submitted, 
the 
Chinese 
government categorizes these companies along 
three tiers.

 In 2024, a data dump 
uploaded on GitHub revealed the inner workings 
of Chinese government contractor i-SOON. The 
leaked documents showed that i-SOON was 
extensively 
engaged 
in 
Chinese 
espionage 
activities. A subsequent report by French threat 
intelligence 
company 
Harfang 
named 
"A 
Comprehensive Analysis of i-SOON’S Commercial 
Offering,"4 and Winona Bernsen’s "Same same, 
but Different"5 report for Margin Research, 
analyzed the i-SOON dump and provided 
significant operational insights into China's hack-
for-hire system. 
 
 In this report, the term "civilian hacker" en-
compasses both Chinese students and professionals 
engaged in hacking competitions and bug bounty 
programs for non-malicious purposes and without 
the distinct aim of furthering state-aligned goals. 
Where applicable, the term “civilian hacker” is speci-
fied by using the terms "vulnerability researchers" or 
"civilian researcher."  
 
Mandated by law to collaborate with Chinese govern-
ment security agencies, the contributions of civilian 
hackers are most immediately observed through the 
identification and dissemination of zero-day vulnera-
bilities to government agencies. As of this writing, 
Chinese state actors are exploiting more zero-days in 
absolute numbers than any other country, as revealed 
by Google Mandiant’s James Sadowski and Casey 
Charrier in their March 2023 write up “Move, Patch, 
Get Out the Way: 2022 Zero-Day Exploitation Contin-
ues at an Elevated Pace.”6 The impact of China’s civil-
ian research teams also extends beyond merely dis-
covering vulnerabilities, fueling a less quantifiable yet 
robust and self-reinforcing offensive cyber ecosystem.

China’s civilian vulnerability research teams and labs 
have largely remained unexplored. Presently, there is 
a lack of comprehensive understanding about (1) 
their research focus, i.e. which ones are concentrating 
on specifically Western products, as well as their sys-
tems makeup and organizational structure; and (2) 
the functioning and relationships of China's broader 
offensive cyber ecosystem within which these entities 
thrive – this also encompasses Chinese technical uni-
versities and student hacking teams. To achieve this, 
this report takes a closer at the participation of lead-
ing Chinese hacking teams and vulnerability research 
laboratories in major international hacking competi-
tions (DEFCON CTF, Pwn2Own, Tianfu Cup) and bug 
bounty programs (Apple, Google Android, Microsoft). 
These teams and laboratories include (a) profession-
als at major Chinese cybersecurity companies who 
conduct vulnerability research on largely U.S. soft-
ware products, including Microsoft, Apple, Adobe, 
VMware, Google, and others. As well as (b) student 
teams from elite Chinese universities that hone their 
offensive cybersecurity skills by participating in Cap-
ture the Flag (CTF) contests.  
 
Section 2 summarizes the main insights of this report. 
Section 3 provides an overview and historical context 
of what is publicly known about China’s hack-for-hire 
system. It also illustrates the capabilities of Chinese 
civilian hackers, and how they are utilized for state ob-
jectives. In sections 4, 5, and 6, the report traces the 
history of the Chinese hacking teams that have partic-
ipated at DEFCON CTF (2013-2023), Pwn2Own (2014-
2017), and the Tianfu Cup (2018-2023). For each of 
the three sections, the report analyzes the team’s per-
formances and the impact they had on shaping Chi-
na's offensive cybersecurity culture. Additionally, the 
report analyzes the competing teams, their areas of 
expertise, connections with academic institutions 
and corporate entities, and their involvement in mili-
tary-civil fusion initiatives aimed at supporting state-
sponsored offensive cyber operations. Section 7 dives 
into the contributions of Chinese researchers and 
companies to the bug bounty programs of Apple, An-
droid (Google), and Microsoft, to identify China’s 
leading civilian entities committed to finding vulner-
abilities in these critical products. It will then exam-
ine Chinese bug bounty programs, their framework, 
and their comparative monetary incentives when jux-
taposed with other international initiatives. Section 8 
provides a concluding assessment and suggests ave-
nues for future research. 
 
A security flaw, glitch, or weakness found in soft-
ware code that could be exploited by an attacker.  
 
A zero-day vulnerability is a software flaw unknown 
to both the software vendor and the public. Since 
these vulnerabilities are undisclosed, and thus un-
patched, they offer attackers a significant ad-
vantage. Discovering zero-days is challenging and 
demands substantial resources, but once found, 
they enable attackers to gain unauthorized access, 
navigate through a network, pilfer data, or compro-
mise a system. It's comparable to having a master 
key that unlocks a hidden door without anyone no-
ticing.  
 
Hacking competitions are events that incentivize 
participants to analyze the newest types of security 
threats, figure out how to assess them, and practice 
how to remediate such issues. In the otherwise dis-
creet realm of cybersecurity, participation in hacking 
competitions is a practical way to publicly showcase 
computer skills on a national or global stage. The re-
port examines two types of competitions: Capture 
the Flag (CTF) contests and exploit competitions. 
CTF competitions focus on a wide range of simu-
lated cybersecurity challenges, while exploit compe-
titions specifically center on identifying and exploit-
ing vulnerabilities in real computer systems or soft-
ware. 
 
A bug bounty program is an initiative in which an or-
ganization offers monetary rewards (bounties) to in-
dependent security researchers or ethical hackers 
who responsibly disclose and report vulnerabilities 
or bugs in their software, applications, or systems. 
Hacking contests, while technically a form of bug 
bounty program, will be conceptually distinguished 
in this report for analytical clarity. Both initiatives 
enable companies to tap into a global pool of re-
searchers, identifying and fixing vulnerabilities be-
fore they can be exploited by malicious actors. Addi-
tionally, they provide a cost-effective alternative to 
hiring full-time security personnel, as independent 
researchers are incentivized to identify vulnerabili-
ties on an as-needed basis.

This report focuses on two areas to provide additional 
insight into the functioning of China’s offensive cyber 
ecosystem: prominent hacking competitions and bug 
bounty programs. 
 
Why these two areas?  
Hacking competitions and bug bounty programs 
function quite similarly. Both provide security 
researchers with monetary reward for identifying and 
providing 
proof 
of 
an 
exploitable 
security 
vulnerability in a soft- or hardware product, which 
motivates participants to invest substantial time and 
effort in breaching a product (box 1). The complex 
challenges that the participants face require 
advanced knowledge and innovative problem-solving 
skills. Which in turn ensures that only those 
specialized will excel. The public visibility and fame 
gained from succeeding can open doors to lucrative 
job offers and collaborative projects with leading 
cybersecurity companies. 
 
From an investigative point of view, prominent 
hacking competitions and bug bounty programs 
provide valuable insights into the company and 
university 
affiliations 
of 
individual 
Chinese 
researchers and teams, as well as their security 
research priorities. They also allow us to compare 
Chinese teams relative to others via (a) competition 
and bug bounty rankings over time, (b) monetary 
prizes secured, and (c) the volume of vulnerabilities 
submitted (sections 4 to 7). DEFCON CTF, Pwn2Own 
and the Tianfu Cup were specifically selected due to 
their prestige, high level of competitiveness, and 
extensive media coverage, making them ideal for 
gathering comprehensive insights into the Chinese 
civilian hacking landscape. 
 
The information on hacking challenges is almost ex-
clusively based on open-source data, including com-
petition and vendor websites, news articles, social 
media posts, and online databases, such as CTFtime. 
CTFtime serves as a comprehensive archive for Cap-

ture the Flag (CTF) competitions (box 1), offering up-
dated details on rankings, team nationality (when 
available), team and competition websites, and team 
membership details (usually identified by partici-
pants' nicknames rather than full names). Addition-
ally, the report granted anonymity to a selected num-
ber of individuals who were willing to provide insights 
and share their experiences and competing in Chinese 
hacking competitions and the Chinese vulnerability 
reporting ecosystem. 
 
Assigning a single nationality to each team that has 
participated in the DEFCON CTF is challenging due to 
some teams being multi-national. Additional difficul-
ties are posed by frequent team name changes and 
high membership turnover. When Chinese teams 
started to compete at DEFCON CTF in 2013, they were 
composed almost exclusively of Chinese citizens from 
a limited number of Chinese universities. A few years 
later, they began to integrate into more international 
teams. To track this evolution, section 4 of the report 
begins its analysis in 2013, focusing on fully Chinese 
teams and then following their development within 
DEFCON CTF. The analysis highlights specific in-
stances in which teams gradually integrated into in-
ternational teams and identifies with whom they 
merged. By contrast, participation in exploit competi-
tions such as Pwn2Own and the Tianfu Cup have re-
mained homogenous over time, with Chinese teams 
rarely, if ever, mixing with participants from non-Chi-
nese entities. This consistency facilitated their classi-
fication as fully Chinese teams throughout the analy-
sis. 
 
Section 7 analyzes three prominent bug bounty pro-
grams to measure the volume of vulnerability reports 
submitted by Chinese researchers and Chinese teams 
over the past decade. The three programs are: (1) An-
droid (Google), (2) Microsoft, and (3) Apple. The three 
companies were chosen because, according to Google 
Mandiant’s Sadowski and Charrier, the majority of 
zero-day vulnerabilities exploited over recent years 
were linked to products developed by Microsoft, 
Google, and Apple.7 The i-SOON leaks8 similarly indi-

cate that i-SOON employees were able to exploit vul-
nerabilities in Microsoft, Google, and Apple products 
to conduct state-sponsored espionage campaigns. 
 
Collated historical data for the Microsoft bug bounty 
program and Google Android’s bug bounty program 
are freely accessible via the respective vendor’s 
website. As of this writing, the Microsoft Security 
Response Center (MSRC) database is organized in a 
structured table format and is available for download 
in Excel format. It contains 7870 rows of entry, each 
representing a vulnerability report, covering the 
period of 2016 to the present.9 Each row includes data 
on the reported vulnerability, the Microsoft service it 
affects, the researcher who reported it, along with 
their company and specific research unit affiliation, as 
well as the date of the report (day, month, and year).  
Google Android’s online database is organized in a 
structured table format, containing data on each 
reported vulnerability from 2016 to the present.10 
However, 
it 
offers 
more 
limited 
information 
compared to Microsoft's database. It includes only the 
researcher who reported the vulnerability along with 
their company and specific research unit affiliation, 
and the date of the report (month and year). The 
databases for Google’s other products are even less 
detailed and often lack the name of vulnerability 
submitters. In contrast to Microsoft, the Android 
database was not available for download in Excel 
format as of this writing. The author created an Excel 
sheet, collating 3750 rows of entry. This process posed 
a few challenges because Google’s database groups 
together multiple vulnerability reports, which had to 
be separated manually.  
As of the time of writing, Apple's vulnerability 
reporting information included detailed information 
about each reported vulnerability, the researcher who 
reported it along with their company and specific 
research unit affiliation, as well as the date of the 
report (day, month, and year). However, gathering 
this information proved to be the most challenging. 
The information was not available for download in 
Excel format and was largely unstructured in the form 
of blog posts, making it very difficult to collect. As a

workaround, 
Apple’s 
vulnerability 
reporting 
information was extracted from an Excel database 
the Atlantic Council compiled for its 2022 report titled 
‘Dragon tails: Preserving international cybersecurity 
research’.” The report’s database covers pertinent 
Apple vulnerability reporting data from 2006 to 
January 2022. All in all, the database has a total of 
6167 rows of entry. 
The Microsoft and Android databases contain 
detailed information about individual researchers 
who contributed to their bug bounty programs 
globally, even though some submissions are sent in by 
researchers using pseudonyms that cannot always be 
linked back to a specific individual. In such cases, 
Chinese affiliations in the report could still be traced 
back by examining the company affiliations of the 
researchers. In contrast, Apple’s Excel database 
includes 
neither 
researcher 
names 
nor 
their 
pseudonyms. It only contains data on the company 
and the specific research unit’s affiliation associated 
with each vulnerability report. Additionally, some 
submissions in the Microsoft and Apple databases are 
entirely anonymous, as highlighted in section 7. Data 
cleaning was conducted across all three databases to 
remove 
double 
entries. 
Additionally, 
different 
spellings 
in 
company 
affiliations, 
particularly 
regarding teams and labs, were manually corrected by 
the author. 
Despite these challenges, the data can be deemed 
robust, as most vulnerability reports are affiliated 
with a specific company or research unit. Leveraging 
this information, the dataset underwent a refinement 
process where a new column was introduced in each 
database. This column categorized vulnerability 
reports based on their origin, with a value of "1" 
denoting reports originating from China, and "2" 
representing reports from other countries. This binary 
categorization approach was implemented due to the 
inherent difficulty in accurately tracing each report to 
its specific country of origin across the global 
landscape. In a few uncertain cases, the author opted 
to assign them a value of "2".

Subsequently, the author applied filters to the 
structured, clean data to isolate vulnerability reports 
originating from China as a whole, as well as from 
individual China-based research teams. The results of 
this analysis are depicted in various charts in this 
report that illustrate China’s overall contributions to 
each bug bounty program compared to the rest of the 
world. The illustrations also break down the 
contributions by Chinese companies and research 
units. While the data from the three platforms was 
analyzed independently, each having its own 
subsection within section 7, collectively they offer a 
comprehensive view of China’s civilian hacker 
landscape and their research focuses. 
Overall, the collected data can be deemed reliable as 
the companies operating these bug bounty programs 
rely on such robust incentive schemes involving 
payouts and public acknowledgments to motivate 
hackers to report vulnerabilities. The rewards offered 
are often substantial. For instance, in 2018, Google 
awarded Guang Gong 112.000 USD, marking Google's 
largest bug bounty payout ever, for the submission of 
a remote exploit chain on a Google Pixel phone.11 
Similarly, in 2021, Microsoft granted 200.000 USD —
then the largest bounty ever awarded by the 
company—to Qihoo 360 researchers who identified a 
vulnerability in the Hyper-V virtualization engine.12

amine the functioning and relationships of China's 
broader offensive cyber ecosystem within which 
civilian hacking teams thrive, including elite uni-
versities and corporate affiliations. 
 
The graph depicted in Figure 1 outlines the key com-
ponents of China's offensive cyber ecosystem ana-
lyzed throughout this report and serves as a guide 
through the insights. 
 
  
 
From right to left, the “Cyber Operations” section of 
the model highlights the essence of China’s hack-for-
hire approach, according to which cyber operations 
are outsourced to private contractors acting as gov-
ernment proxies. Civilian hackers submit vulnerabili-
ties, which are gathered by government security 
agencies and disseminated to provincial branches and 
contractors for cyber operations, as highlighted in the 
“Vulnerability Pipeline” component. Though this isn't 
necessarily the sole vulnerability ecosystem in China, 
it is likely the most prevalent one. In this ecosystem, 
the zero-day exploits leveraged in Chinese state-spon-

sored cyber activities heavily rely on the skills of spe-
cialized researchers, which might often be unaware of 
their own contributions. The contribution of Chinese 
civilian hackers goes beyond just discovering vulnera-
bilities. Their broader impact on China's cyber ecosys-
tem – such as establishing cybersecurity startups, 
hacking competitions, and contributing to creation of 
research labs – is arguably even more significant. This 
aspect is detailed in the “Civilian Hackers Ecosystem” 
part of graph, which is the primary focus of this report. 
The report further illustrates how this component in-
teracts with the others, particularly the Vulnerability 
Pipeline, by examining the research focus of China's 
hacking teams to determine which specific Western 
products and systems they target.  
 
 
 
Within China's offensive ecosystem, we can roughly 
divide Chinese hackers into two distinct groups. 
Prominent Chinese researchers who have distin-
guished themselves by winning or participating in 
prestigious exploit hacking competitions, such as 
Pwn2Own and the Tianfu Cup (sections 5 and 6). 
These individuals are often affiliated with level 1 
Technical Support Units (TSU), which are Chinese 
companies that contribute the most vulnerabilities to 
China's premiere intelligence agency, the Ministry of 
State Security (MSS) (table 1 and section 3.3). These 
researchers have refined their abilities over time 
through incentives offered by international hacking 
competitions and bug bounty programs, with West-
ern products and systems frequently being their most 
sought-after targets. There is usually no clear evi-
dence that directly links them to Chinese state-spon-
sored cyber operations. 
 
The second group encompasses non-public facing, 
government-contracted hackers on revealed by the i-
SOON leaks, Intrusion Truth’s revelations, and several 
U.S. indictments (section 3.1). These individuals have 
not participated in hacking competitions nor are they 
generally contributors to bug bounty programs. This 
could indicate a lower level of technical proficiency in 
targeting specifically Apple, Google (Android), and Mi-
crosoft products, but the evidentiary basis for this is 
rather thin. 
 
The way China’s hack-for-hire ecosystem essentially 
works is that the contracted hackers are executing 
cyber operations, while the elite researchers focus on 
vulnerability research and cybersecurity startup crea-
tion, which in turn helps the contracted hackers meet 
immediate mission requirements, and in the medium 
and long-run sustains China’s broader offensive cyber 
ecosystem. This setup effectively leverages elite vul-
nerability researchers while also mitigating against 
professional or reputational risks, because of the re-
searcher’s non-direct involvement in malicious state-
sponsored activities. The Pinduoduo case involving He 
Qidan (section 4.5) highlighted how China's elite 
hackers uphold elevated ethical standards. Renowned 
hacker He Qidan purportedly lost his job due to his re-
fusal to participate in illicit activities for the company 
he was working for at the time (Pinduoduo), prompt-
ing key members of China’s cybersecurity community 
to rally behind him, publicly condemning Pinduoduo’s 
actions. It remains unclear to what extent this ethical 
mindset among China’s elite hackers extends to na-
tional security issues. 
 
 
 
More than half of the level 1 Technical Support Units 
(TSU), which are the private companies that contrib-
ute the most vulnerabilities to China's premiere intel-
ligence agency, the Ministry of State Security (MSS), as 
identified by Cary and Del Rosso (table 1 and section 
3.3), are also companies that play key organizational 
roles in the hacking competitions scrutinized in this 
report. These companies, such as NSFocus, TopSec, 
Huawei, VenusTech, and Qi An Xin, sponsor the Tianfu 
Cup (section 6), while others like JD and Tencent spon-
sor Chinese CTF competitions (section 4). The teams 
hosted within these companies are also successful 
competition performers and bug bounty contributors 
(ex. Qihoo 360, Tencent, Ant Group, Chaitin Tech, 
Sangfor, and DBAPP). Interestingly, for cyber MCF pur-
poses the level 1 TSU’s engagement with Beijing 
ranges from very close relationships, such as Qihoo  
 
FROM VEGAS TO CHENGDU 
13 
 
 
360 and Qi An Xin (sections 5.3 and 5.5), to more 
strained relationships with lesser integration, such as 
Tencent and the Ant Group (sections 5.4 and 6.3). 
    
The absence of additional level 1 TSUs in the exam-
ined events and initiatives covered in this report, may 
stem from the company’s internal policies that might 
be restricting their participation in non-China based 
hacking competitions and bug bounty programs. An-
other plausible explanation could be that some TSUs 
exclusively focus on Chinese soft- and hardware prod-
ucts rather than Western ones. 
 
 
 
The number of research labs and associated teams 
vary from company to company, in both size, quantity, 
and research focus. For example, Qihoo 360 boasts 
over 19 teams (section 5.3 and Appendix A) while the 
Ant Group hosts nine (section 6.3). Tencent operates 
7 to 10 labs (section 5.4 and Appendix B) while Cyber 
Kunlun has just one lab (section 6.4). In general, we 
can state that, the higher the number of teams and 
labs the larger the company, financial capital, human 
resources, and areas of specialization. Cybersecurity 
companies such as Qihoo tend to maintain several 
teams spanning various product lines and depart-
ments. Although specific team sizes are challenging 
to pinpoint, 360 Alpha and 360 Vulcan might each 
comprise over 40 members. Moreover, Qihoo teams 
have very different and distinct logos which might  
 
 
 
indicate a level of autonomy and individualism. By 
contrast, Tencent has far fewer teams that are orga-
nized within one unified department. The logos of 
Tencent’s labs thus also follow a similar design, which 
reinforces the appearance of a sense of unity and col-
laboration among them. 
 
 
 
Chinese prominent, contest-winning researchers 
have been major contributors to the bug bounty pro-
grams of Apple, Google Android, and Microsoft (sec-
tion 7). From 2017 to 2023, Chinese researchers con-
tributed 27% of all vulnerabilities submitted to these 
three bug bounty programs, while the rest of the 
world accounted for 59%. More specifically: 
 
• 
 Between 2017 and 2020, China 
contributed more than 50% of the vulnerabilities 
reported, with the rest of the world accounting for 
44%. From 2021 to 2023, China's contribution de-
creased to 35%, while the rest of the world's con-
tribution increased to 65% (section 7.2). 
• 
 From 2017 to 2020, Chinese entities re-
ported more than 25% of the vulnerabilities re-
ported, while the rest of the world reported 50%.  
23% of submissions were anonymous. Between 
2021 and 2023, Chinese researchers reported 18% 
of the vulnerabilities, compared to 75% from the 
     Source: Cary & Del Rosso (2023) Sleight of Hand, Appendix A, Atlantic Council

14 
rest of the world. Only 7% were reported anony-
mously (section 7.3). 
• 
 From 2017 to 2020, Chinese researchers re-
ported approximately 15% of vulnerabilities, while 
the rest of the world reported 47%. 38% were sub-
mitted anonymously. From 2021 to January 2022, 
Chinese researchers reported 28% of vulnerabili-
ties, compared to 38% from the rest of the world. 
34% were reported anonymously (section 7.4). 
 
 
 
The bug bounty submissions to Apple, Google An-
droid, and Microsoft reveal a distinct division between 
two time periods: 2017-2020 and 2021-2023 (section 
7). In the earlier period, Qihoo 360 and Tencent domi-
nated submissions for Microsoft, Google Android, and 
Apple. By the end of 2023, Cyber Kunlun and Oppo 
Amber Security Lab emerged as the primary contribu-
tors for Microsoft and Google Android, with the Ant 
Lightyear Security Lab reaching the top position for 
Apple. Meanwhile, teams from Qihoo 360 and Ten-
cent significantly reduced their contributions from 
2021 onward.  This shift likely occurred due to U.S. 
sanctions and researchers transitioning to other com-
panies.  
 
 
 
In the report’s analysis of vulnerability submissions to 
Apple, Google Android, and Microsoft, a couple of 
trends can be identified following the implementa-
tion of the 'Regulations on the Management of Net-
work Product Security Vulnerabilities’ RMSV, which 
was announced in 2020, and came into effect in 2021 
(section 3.3). 
 
• 
 Between 2017 and 2023, Chi-
nese researchers consistently reported on average 
19 vulnerabilities per month to Google Android's 
bug bounty program (section 7.2). 
• 
 During the period from 2017 to 2020, 
Chinese entities reported on average 18 vulnera-
bilities per month to Microsoft's bug bounty pro-
gram. Between 2021 and 2023, that number rose 
to 22 (section 7.3). 
• 
 From 2017 to 2020, Chinese entities re-
ported on average 6 vulnerabilities per month to 
Apple's bug bounty program. Between 2021 and 
January 2022, that number increased to 11 (sec-
tion 7.4). 
 
While the RMSV may have created some deterrent 
effects, Chinese entities continue to submit vul-
nerabilities in substantial numbers. The extent to 
which this finding affects China’s effectiveness 
model is unclear and is further explored in sum-
mary insight 16 on “Open Questions Regarding 
China’s Model Effectiveness.” 
 
 
 
The success of the Chinese teams is often credited to 
a small number of individuals (section 7). From 2017 
to 2020, over 60% of vulnerabilities reported by Qi-
hoo’s 360 C0RE to Google Android were submitted by 
Mingjian Zhou, either individually or in collaboration 
with a few additional team members. Within 360 Al-
pha nearly all vulnerabilities were reported by Guang 
Gong, whereas in 360 IceSword, over half were re-
ported by Chen Gengjia, either individually or in col-
laboration with other team members. Han Zinuo con-
tributed to over 50% of vulnerabilities reported by 360 
SRC to Google Android.  And in the case of Qihoo’s 360 
Vulcan Yuki Chen was responsible for 68% of the 
team’s submitted vulnerabilities to Microsoft. 
 
Fluctuations in a team’s contributions can often be 
traced back to a single individual transition between 
companies. This has been particularly true since 2020. 
For example, when Han Zinuo switched from 360 SRC 
to OPPO in 2020, submissions from 360 to Google An-
droid decreased significantly, while OPPO saw a sub-
stantial increase, largely due to Han's contributions. 
Likewise, when Yuki Chen moved from 360 Vulcan to 
Cyber Kunlun in 2020, Microsoft witnessed a signifi-
cant decrease in contributions from 360 Vulcan. Cyber 
Kunlun meanwhile experienced a remarkable surge, 
with Chen being responsible for 62% of the team’s 
submissions to Microsoft. Sangfor experienced a sig-
nificant boost when former 360 C0RE member Peng 
Zhiniang joined the company as a CTO in late 2020. 
FROM VEGAS TO CHENGDU 
15 
Following Peng's arrival, Sangfor's vulnerabilities con-
tributions to Microsoft surged, and the company se-
cured the third place in the Tianfu Cup 2023.  
 
The migration of researchers to other Chinese firms 
(ex. Sangfor and OPPO), combined with the creation 
of new cyber security companies (ex. Cyber Kunlun), is 
likely leading to an expansion and diversification of 
China's offensive cyber capabilities. This underscores 
how China’s model heavily depends on a small pool of 
high-level talent for vulnerability discovery. 
 
 
 
Some university departments that host teams partic-
ipating in the DEFCON CTF have been (a) linked to Chi-
nese state-sponsored cyber operations, (b) conducted 
vulnerability research with Chinese companies that 
have been linked to Chinese state-sponsored cyber 
operations, or (c) serve as fertile recruitment centers 
for Chinese security agencies (section 4). 
 
• In 2018, Chinese state-linked network reconnais-
sance activities were linked to infrastructure 
owned by Tsinghua University (THU) (section 4.3). 
It is unknown whether any Blue Lotus team mem-
bers were involved in these cyber espionage oper-
ations. However, THU has forged research partner-
ships with prominent Chinese cybersecurity firms, 
some of which have been either implicated in 
state-sponsored cyber espionage campaigns or 
have providing government agencies with zero-
day vulnerabilities. 
• Threat intelligence reports indicate strong link-
ages between Shanghai Jiao Tong University 
(SJTU) (section 4.4) and Chinese state-sponsored 
cyber espionage activities. SJTU’s School of Infor-
mation Security Engineering – which is home to 
the 0ops team – has been accused of providing di-
rect support to PLA Unit 61398 (APT1). SJTU also 
operates the Higher-Ed Vulnerability Database, 
which gathers reports from researchers, profes-
sors, and students and forwards them to the Chi-
nese Ministry of State Security. 
• While Zhejiang University (ZHU) (section 4.5) does 
not appear to have any ties to specific Chinese ma-
licious cyber campaigns, its School of Computer 
Science and Technology – which hosts the AAA 
team – was identified by Mandiant to be a source 
for recruiting individuals into the PLA’s Unit 61398 
(APT1). 
 
 
 
 
Since the early 2010s, Chinese teams from select uni-
versities and companies have rapidly emerged as 
frontrunners in prestigious international hacking 
competitions, including DEFCON CTF and Pwn2Own. 
At DEFCON, Chinese teams consistently reached the 
finals from 2013 to 2023, posing a significant chal-
lenge to U.S. dominance (section 4.2). Similarly, Chi-
nese winnings at Pwn2Own surged from securing 
13% of the entire prize pool in 2014 to 79% in 2019 
(section 5.2). 
 
 
  
The absence of Chinese hackers at Pwn2Own since 
2018 has significantly altered the contest’s landscape 
(section 5). Throughout 2022 and 2023, no partici-
pants attempted to breach iPhone and Google Pixel 
devices. This marked the end of a 15-year streak of tar-
geting Apple products. The notable absence of Chi-
nese hacking teams that specialized in targeting 
these devices explains this break far better than as-
suming that the iPhone and Pixel have become un-
breachable. Concurrently, these vulnerabilities are 
highly likely evaluated by China's security agencies for 
potential use in cyber malicious operations. This illus-
trates that cybersecurity fragmentation and protec-
tionist vulnerability policies significantly undermine 
global cybersecurity.

Chinese hacking competitions have transitioned from 
being mere student training ground and recruitment 
platforms to serving as tools for internal trainings 
within government-contracted companies and as 
mechanisms for transferring vulnerability knowledge 
to Chinese security agencies. In the early 2010s, the 
success of Chinese hacking teams at DEFCON CTF 
prompted major technology and cybersecurity com-
panies like Baidu, Tencent, and Qihoo 360 to get in-
volved (section 4). These corporations provided spon-
sorships, outright acquired winning teams, organized 
CTF events and offered attractive benefits to recruit 
members.  
 
In 2024, leaks revealed the involvement of i-SOON, a 
government-contracted company engaged in exten-
sive espionage activities. It served as the main sponsor 
of a competition in China organized by a DEFCON CTF 
champion team, marking the closest connection be-
tween a top-performing team at DEFCON CTF and 
Chinese state-sponsored espionage efforts (section 
4.2). 
 
Retired team members often either joined tech gi-
ants, such as Qihoo, Alibaba, Tencent, Huawei and Qi 
An Xin, or created their own cyber security startups. 
These startups include Saining Network, Starcross 
Technology (section 4.3.1), Chaitin Tech, Bolean Tech-
nology (section 4.5.1), and Cyber Kunlun (section 6.4). 
These startups provide niche digital services, such as 
cyber ranges and automated vulnerability discovery 
systems, to Chinese companies and government 
agencies alike. They also figure among important 
zero-day vulnerability contributors to China’s security 
agencies.  
 
This ecosystem has been further reinforced by the 
multitude of Chinese CTF competitions that have 
emerged since the mid-2010s. Today, hacking 
competitions play a central role in China's 
cybersecurity educational curriculum and have 
significantly contributed to the expansion of the 
country's cybersecurity education and training 
market. 
 
 
 
Some of the Chinese teams that gained international 
famed have set up their own China-based hacking 
competitions. This includes among others:  BCTF, the 
XCTF International League, 0CTF/TCTF, Real World 
CTF, and N1CTF.  
 
• From 2013 to 2014, Blue Lotus collaborated with 
the Baidu Research Institute to create the Baidu 
CTF (BCTF) competition, the first Chinese CTF com-
petition to use the Attack-Defense format (section 
4.1). In 2018 and 2019, BCTF was held in Beijing as 
part of i DEFCON China [Beta] and DEFCON China 
1.0 (section 4.2). 
• Founded in 2014 by Tsinghua University's Blue Lo-
tus team, XCTF is organized and hosted by Blue Lo-
tus and Saining Network Security. The competition 
unfolds in various phases across different Chinese 
cities, including Hangzhou, Chengdu, Beijing, and 
Shanghai (section 4.3).  
• Initiated in 2017, 0CTF/TCTF is held in Shanghai. It 
is co-organized by the Tencent Keen Security Lab 
and Shanghai Jiao Tong University’s 0ops team 
(section 4.4). 
• Chaitin Tech initiated its own global jeopardy-style 
CTF competition in Beijing in 2018, called Real 
World CTF (section 4.5.1). 
• In 2018, the Nu1L team established its own Jeop-
ardy-style contest, named N1CTF (section 4.2). 
• The W&M team established its own Jeopardy-
style contest in 2020, named WMCTF. The 2023 
WMCTF edition was supported by i-SOON as the 
primary sponsor, the government-contracted firm 
whose extensive espionage activities were ex-
posed in early 2024 (section 4.2). 
 
The emergence of numerous CTF competitions since 
the mid-2010s could be a contributing factor to the 
decreased presence of Chinese teams at DEFCON CTF 
2023 (figure 3). Fewer Pwn2Own-like competitions 
seem to be available in China. The most relevant ones 
are GeekCon and the Tianfu Cup. GeekCon (previously 
GeekPwn) was established in 2014 by DarkNavy (for-
merly Keen Team). It has been held across China and 
even had iterations in Las Vegas. The Tianfu Cup was 
FROM VEGAS TO CHENGDU 
17 
first held in 2018, and takes place annually in 
Chengdu, Sichuan province (section 6).  
 
 
Finding information on China-based bug bounty plat-
forms and their payouts structures is challenging (sec-
tion 7.5). Chinese bug bounty platforms offer limited 
incentives for hackers, with rewards often being un-
specified or comparatively low. Similarly, Chinese ex-
ploit acquisition platforms offer payouts that are on 
average significantly lower compared to non-Chinese 
ones. Apart from navigating US sanctions, Chinese re-
searchers must additionally deal with sharing their 
bounty rewards with their employers (sometimes up 
to 50% of the payouts). 
 
 
 
The Tianfu Cup has been predominantly focused on 
Western products. Due to their comparatively lower 
rewards, Chinese products have received minimal at-
tention at the Tianfu Cup. In 2023 there was a notice-
able change as the Tianfu Cup began to feature an in-
creasing number of Chinese products (section 6.2.2).  
 
Despite the Tianfu Cup’s significant prize pool, partic-
ipants have raised concerns about how the prize 
money is distributed among team members and their 
organization. Companies like Qihoo 360, which have 
multiple teams with many members, often consoli-
date researchers into a handful of teams for the com-
petition. This practice frequently leads to the exclu-
sion of many talented individuals, often resulting in 
them earning less and receiving no social recognition. 
 
 
 
The Tianfu Cup exclusively features Chinese teams 
(section 6), while CTF competitions held in China are 
open to international participation. This distinction is 
highly likely because CTFs participants are not re-
quired to disclose zero-day vulnerabilities. Likely for 
the same reason, some Chinese teams have also been 
able to gradually integrate into international teams

participating in the U.S.-based DEFCON CTF competi-
tion. 
 
 
 
Chinese hackers likely report vulnerabilities they dis-
cover to both government agencies and Western ven-
dors through their bug bounty programs. This asser-
tion is supported by several factors: (1) Chinese law 
mandates the reporting of vulnerabilities, and Chi-
nese companies must annually submit a specific 
number of vulnerabilities to the CNNVD to maintain 
their partnerships with the organization (section 3.3). 
(2) The report’s analysis of Google Android, Microsoft, 
and Apple’s bug bounty data reveals a significant 
number of submissions from Chinese researchers up 
to the end of 2023 (section 7). 
 
Despite Western vendors receiving a lot of infor-
mation about zero-day vulnerabilities, the Chinese 
system continues to be effective in exploiting West-
ern products. This raises the question as to why. Are 
these distinct individual zero-days and zero-day 
chains? Is it a patching problem? Or does Chinese ef-
ficiency stem from inadequate security practices 
among the targeted victims? 
 
 
 
China’s domestic priorities coupled with persistent 
geopolitical tensions will likely shift the focus of Chi-
nese hacking competitions. The Tianfu Cup 2023 
marked a significant departure from targeting West-
ern products toward Chinese ones (section 6.2.2).13 
This trend will likely create future incentives for Chi-
nese teams to specialize in hunting down vulnerabili-
ties in domestic products. It would also allow Beijing 
to increase incentives that align with the nation’s 
long-term national security interests.

China’s Hack-for-
Hire Approach 
This section provides an overview of what is publicly 
known about China’s hack-for-hire ecosystem, 
drawing on foundational research and analysis (3.1). 
It delves into China’s approach and its significance, 
with a particular focus on China’s vast talent pool 
(3.2) and the national regulations that compel 
civilians to collaborate with the government (3.3).

15 Frank Jüris, “Security Implications of China-Owned Critical Infrastructure in the 
European Union” (European Parliament, June 2023), https://www.europarl.eu-
ropa.eu/RegData/etudes/IDAN/2023/702592/EXPO_IDA(2023)702592_EN.pdf. 
Since assuming China’s presidency in 2013, Xi 
Jinping underscored a strong commitment to 
advancing Beijing’s cyber capabilities. In 2014, he 
unveiled China's ambition to transform into a "cyber 
power," comparing the twin goals of developing 
China’s information technology and its cybersecurity 
capabilities to “two wings of a bird and two wheels 
of an engine14”. This vision was supported by large 
investments, organizational refinements within and 
across security agencies, and the establishment of 
relevant legal frameworks to bolster China’s 
offensive cyber and defensive capabilities.  
 
Yet, the narrative extends beyond state-led efforts. 
China’s civilian hacker community has been an 
instrumental, but often overlooked driving force in 
its own right, evolving in tandem with and 
supporting state efforts. At the forefront of this 
dynamic stands China's Military-Civil Fusion (MCF) 
initiative. The MCF initiative seeks to harness the 
synergy 
between 
commercial 
and 
defense 
advancements, leveraging civilian talent to enhance 
and back the armed branch of the Chinese 
Communist Party (CCP), the People’s Liberation Army 
(PLA).15  
 
The roots of the MCF initiative extend back many dec-
ades. Every leader from Mao Zedong onward has im-
plemented a program to compel the civilian sectors of 
Chinese society to contribute to the PLA’s develop-
ment. However, since Xi Jinping assumed power in 
2013, the importance of MCF has markedly increased, 
evolving into a strategic priority. Chinese authorita-
tive military texts, such as the PLA 2013 publication 
"The Science of Military Strategy", have emphasized 
the integration of military-civil collaboration in peace 
and war time, including in cyberspace.16  
 
The demarcation line separating China’s military and 
civil domains in cyberspace has become particularly

Key Points 
 
• Intrusion Truth, U.S. indictments and the i-
SOON leaks exposed China's hack-for-hire 
model, tracing a pattern linking contract hack-
ers to intelligence activities. 
 
• Contractors depend on government agencies 
for zero-day vulnerabilities, primarily sourced 
from specialized research teams and labs in se-
lect private firms. 
 
• This hack-for-hire model is significant due to 
China's highly skilled civilian hacker commu-
nity. 
 
• Since the early 2010s, Chinese hackers have 
emerged as leading contenders in interna-
tional hacking competitions and bug bounty 
programs. 
 
• Hacking competitions play a crucial role in Chi-
na's cybersecurity education and have contrib-
uted to the expansion of the country's cyberse-
curity market. 
 
• Since 2018, China has increasingly controlled 
the domestic vulnerability discovery process.  
 
• This system has proved effective for China. 
Chinese APTs exploit a higher number of zero-
days than APTs from other countries.

fluid or has entirely vanished. In April 2017, an anon-
ymous online entity known as Intrusion Truth began 
to publicly unveil the identities of individuals associ-
ated with Chinese advanced persistent threats 
(APTs).17 Over the course of six years, Intrusion Truth 
exposed more than 30 individual belonging to at 
least six APTs affiliated with the Ministry of State Se-
curity (MSS), China’s premier intelligence agency. 
The revelations exposed a pattern connecting front 
companies with MSS local/regional bureaus and 
contract hackers. More broadly, they shed light on 
the intricate relationships between China’s IT sector, 
academic institutions, and the country’s intelligence 
agencies. At times, their findings were corroborated 
by leading threat intelligence firms and were followed 
by indictments by the US Department of Justice. 
 
Intrusion Truth primarily relied on publicly available 
information to establish connections between vari-
ous cues across different sources, platforms, and iden-
tities. The group's initial inquiries into APT3 (2017) ex-
posed the links between operatives Wu Yingzhuo and 
Dong Hao, their front company Boyusec, and the 
Guangdong bureau of the MSS.18 On its website, 
which became unavailable following the exposures, 
Boyusec had listed Chinese tech giant Huawei as a 
business partner.19 In its APT40 investigation (2020), 
Intrusion Truth linked no less than 13 front compa-
nies to a professor, former PLA officer, at Hainan Uni-
versity's Information Security Department. The pro-
fessor contributed to the recruitment efforts for these 
companies, with one of them operating from the uni-
versity's library.20 Recent analysis by the group into 
APT41 (2022) indicated a broader effort by the MSS to 
enlist graduate students into its ranks using front 
companies21, whether with or without the knowledge 
of the universities.22 In some cases, Intrusion Truth’s

revelations have led to indictments by the U.S. De-
partment of Justice (APT3, APT10, APT31, APT40). 
In February 2024, additional details surfaced about 
China’s hack-for-hire system from leaked files, chat 
logs, and images associated with the Chinese security 
contractor Shanghai Anxun Information Co. (上海安
洵信息公司), known as "i-SOON," which were 
uploaded on the code-sharing platform Github.23 
Although the source remains unclear, it seems likely 
that the information was deliberately leaked by a 
disgruntled staff member.24 The documents revealed 
that i-SOON had been contracted by the Chinese 
government to carry out espionage operations on its 
behalf. These contracts, spanning eight years, 
specifically outlined objectives to identify targets and 
extract data from at least 20 foreign governments 
and territories.25 Among the targeted countries were 
India, Hong Kong, Thailand, South Korea, the United 
Kingdom, Taiwan, and Malaysia.  
According to an analysis by threat intelligence 
company Harfang, i-SOON enjoys a significant level of 
operational independence. The analysis indicates that 
while it sometimes receives requests directly from 
customers, such as breaching email servers to retrieve 
relevant content, there are instances where i-SOON 
independently acquires access or data it believes may 
interest clients and then attempts to sell it to them. 26 
27 In such cases, i-SOON provides sample documents 
to clients to demonstrate the relevance of the target. 
Since 2013, i-SOON has established an "APT research" 
division focused on "overseas targets," offering 
different services. These include obtaining access to a 
victim's network, extracting data, and generating 
intelligence reports.28

The leaks have additionally shed light on the signifi-
cance of hacking competitions in aiding state-spon-
sored operations. i-SOON created a CTF platform for 
internal training and organized its own hacking com-
petition, named the "Anxun Cup," to attract highly 
skilled individuals. In order to achieve this, i-SOON col-
laborated with prominent Chinese defense contrac-
tors like Qi An Xin’s Pangu Team (section 5.5) and ex-
plored the possibility of seeking support from estab-
lished CTF entities in China, such as Blue Lotus and 
Chaitin Tech (section 4.2), as shown in Figure 2.29  
 
Furthermore, the leaks have reaffirmed the role of 
China-based hacking competitions like the Tianfu Cup 
as a means for the government to acquire valuable 
zero-day vulnerabilities. Specifically, the leaks outline 
a process in which vulnerabilities submitted by civil-
ian hackers to participate in the Tianfu Cup are gath-
ered by government security agencies. These vulnera-
bilities are later disseminated to provincial branches  
 
 
 
29 Winnona Bernsen, “Same Same, but Different.” 
 
 
 
 
of these agencies, which then forward them to con-
tractors for the execution of cyber operations (section 
6.2.1). Based on this framework, China's specialized 
hackers uncover zero-day vulnerabilities that are then 
utilized by government contractors for cyber opera-
tions. This doesn't suggest that it's the sole model in 
China, but it has been demonstrated to be a prevalent 
one. 
 
This matters for two main reasons. Firstly, China 
boasts some of the most skilled civilian hackers world-
wide, evident from their performance in international 
hacking competitions and bug bounty programs. Sec-
ondly, these researchers are mandated to cooperate 
with the government, including reporting the vulner-
abilities they discover. I will examine each aspect indi-
vidually. Together, these components constitute the 
foundation of China’s hack-for-hire model and its 
wider offensive cyber ecosystem.

Since the early 2010s, Chinese teams from a limited 
number of universities and companies have 
emerged as leading contenders in the most challeng-
ing and prestigious international hacking competi-
tions, including DEFCON CTF and Pwn2Own, within 
a few years. At DEFCON, the Blue Lotus team first 
reached the finals in 2013, and from then until 2023, 
between one and four Chinese teams have consist-
ently reached the finals each year, representing the 
only significant challenge to US dominance (section 
4.2). Similarly, at Pwn2Own, the winnings of Chinese 
participants increased from 13% in 2014 to 79% in 
2019 of the total prize money awarded to all partici-
pants (section 5.2). Similarly, Chinese hackers have 
been top contributors to the bug bounty programs of 
prominent US-based companies. From 2017 to 2023, 
China alone contributed 27% of all vulnerabilities sub-
mitted to the bug bounty programs of Apple, Google 
Android, and Microsoft combined, while the rest of 
the world accounted for 59% (section 7). Individual re-
searchers and teams have garnered numerous recog-
nitions, frequently figuring among the top spots in 
these program’s rankings of best researchers and 
teams for both the caliber and quantity of the vulner-
abilities they've uncovered.  
 
These achievements led to the establishment of 
China’s own world-class hacking competitions, the 
creation of influential startups, and the development 
and expansion of some of today’s top Chinese security 
research teams and laboratories. These will be ex-
plored in detail throughout the report. The strength of 
China’s cybersecurity ecosystem is bolstered by ex-
panding professional and educational opportunities 
in the domestic offensive cyber sector. According to 
statistics from the China Cybersecurity Industry Alli-
ance (2023), the cyber security sector is poised for sus-
tained growth in the coming years, with a projected 
market size exceeding 11 billion USD by 2025.30 A

China highlights that the sector’s growth is primarily 
fueled by the IT education and training sector, which 
saw the most rapid growth in the first half of 2022, 
with a year-on-year increase of 33%.31 This surge was 
particularly evident in security training, drilling, and 
testing platforms, attributed in part to the popularity 
of hacking contests.32 
 
Cybersecurity education in China has also gained mo-
mentum, with over 200 domestic universities offering 
cybersecurity or information security majors as of 
March 2023.33 Hacking competitions have become in-
tegral to the cybersecurity curriculum. Under the 
guidance of the Ministry of Education, the Discipline 
Evaluation Group of the Academic Degrees Commit-
tee of the State Council, released a White Paper on the 
Practical Ability of Cybersecurity Talents - Talent Eval-
uation in September 2023.34 63% of institutions sur-
vey in the White Paper deemed competing in hacking 
competitions highly effect for training cybersecurity 
talents. To encourage active participation in these 
competitions, 75% of colleges surveyed even finan-
cially reward students who excel in hacking competi-
tions.35 75% of institutions have also set up dedicated 
budgets to establish advanced attack and defense la-
boratories which are designed to enhance a students' 
practical abilities in network security through "practi-
cal required courses."36 
In alignment with China’s MCF policy, the Chinese 
government has systemically utilized cyber-related 
civilian resources for strategic purposes. This has 
manifested in different ways. For instance, various 
entities, including universities and companies, col-
laborate with the Chinese government across a spec-
trum of cyber activities—from submitting zero-days 
and offering cyber courses to the military, to estab-

lishing co-partnered defense research labs and set-
ting up private IT infrastructure for state-sponsored 
hacking operations. On the private sector and aca-
demic side, the collaborations can range from a sin-
gle individual hacker or professor to entire teams 
comprised of both students and seasoned cyber se-
curity professionals. 
 
In 2018, the Chinese government began to 
significantly focus on regulating the work of 
cybersecurity 
researchers, 
students, 
hacking 
competitions, and bug bounty programs. As such, 
Beijing is steadily tightening its grip on the domestic 
process of vulnerability discovery and disclosure. In a 
first step, the Chinese government began to prohibit 
Chinese security researchers from participating in 
hacking competitions on foreign soil (2018).37 Thus 
preventing the Chinese cybersecurity community 
from 
publicly 
showcasing 
and 
disclosing 
vulnerabilities at events such as Pwn2Own. Secondly, 
in 2021 Beijing established the “Regulations on the 
Management of Security Vulnerabilities in Network 
Products (RMSV),” which compels Chinese tech 
companies – and their researchers – to directly hand 
over any zero-day vulnerabilities to the government 
within two days of discovery. From there, government 
agencies can cherry-pick which vulnerabilities should 
be publicly disclosed, and which ones will be kept 
secret and used for espionage and offensive cyber 
campaigns. According to Microsoft’s Digital Defense 
Report 
2022, 
“China’s 
vulnerability 
reporting 
regulation went into effect September 2021, marking 
a first in the world for a government to require the 
reporting of vulnerabilities into a government 
authority for review prior to the vulnerability being 
shared with the product or service owner… this new 
regulation might enable elements in the Chinese 
government to stockpile reported vulnerabilities 
toward weaponizing them.”38 In December 2021, 
Alibaba Cloud faced penalties under RMSV when its 
security engineer Chen Zhaojun discovered the Log4j 
vulnerability and reported it to Apache without prior 
notification to the Chinese authorities. Alibaba Cloud

was fined and its information-sharing collaboration 
with China's Ministry of Industry and Information 
Technology (MIIT) was suspended.39 
Insights from Kristin Del Rosso and Dakota Cary’s 
Sleight of Hand report (2023) reveal how China’s 
military and intelligence agencies gain access to zero-
day vulnerabilities discovered by security research 
teams in private companies.40 When a China-based 
researcher discovers a zero-day, they are required to 
report said vulnerability to the Cybersecurity Threat 
and Vulnerability Information Sharing Platform 
(NVDB), overseen by the MIIT. This information is then 
made available – if not even directly channeled – to 
the MSS and PLA-affiliated entities.  
In a separate process, the MSS-run China National 
Vulnerability Database of Information Security 
(CNNVD) mandates its private-sector partners to 
contribute software vulnerabilities to become a 
‘technical support unit’ (TSU). This system then ranks 
TSUs based on the number of vulnerabilities 
submitted (table 2).41 In total, the report identified 
151 registered TSUs which collectively provide at least 
1,955 software vulnerabilities to the MSS, of which at 
least 141 are categorized as "critical." Once 
vulnerabilities are reported to the CNNVD, they are 
highly likely evaluated by the MSS for their potential 
operational use. In 2017, U.S. threat intelligence 
company Recorded Future indicated that critical 
vulnerabilities are assessed by the MSS for their utility 
in intelligence operations before being publicly 
disclosed.42 In addition to weaponizing zero-days, 
these regulations also ensure a stronger relationship 
between 
Chinese 
civilian 
hackers 
and 
job 
opportunities at Chinese state institutions and 
private sector companies (that support state-
sponsored activities). Thus, apart from having 
unrestricted access to zero-day vulnerabilities, this 
setup allows Beijing to also shape the structure and 
economic 
incentives 
of 
Chinese 
hacking 
competitions 
and 
bug 
bounty 
programs 
strategically.

Are these regulations effective? Finding 0-days is a 
costly and time-intense process. For governments to 
do this by themselves, would pose significant 
resource and logistical challenges. Alternatively, as 
explained by CSS researcher Max Smeets, purchasing 
zero-days from black markets is expensive and 
fraught with information asymmetries between 
sellers and buyers.43 This challenge is compounded by 
the prevalence of low-quality exploits, further 
complicating the task of distinguishing reliable 
ones.44As of this writing, Chinese APTs are exploiting 
more zero-days in absolute numbers than APTs from 
other countries, based on available data. In 2023, 
threat intelligence company Mandiant revealed that 
the use of zero-days by state-linked Chinese groups 
has nearly doubled between 2020 and 2022, and 
they have exploited more zero-days than any other 
country.45 The speed at which threat actors exploit 
these 
vulnerabilities 
has 
also 
increased 
significantly.46 Without introducing major systematic

changes, China has effectively shaped the existing 
environment in its favor.  
 
The Chinese government has effectively addressed 
these challenges by strategically positioning itself as 
the ultimate recipient in the vulnerability disclosure 
processes of civilian researchers. This has resulted in 
an alternative model to the Coordinated Vulnerability 
Disclosure 
(CVD) 
and 
Government 
Disclosure 
Decision Processes (GDDP) (box 2). This approach 
enables the Chinese government to take advantage, 
at scale and almost no cost, of some of the best 
vulnerability researchers on the globe, providing a 
unique solution that mitigates the inefficiencies 
associated with traditional zero-day acquisitions.47 As 
it will be shown in this report, the most prolific 
suppliers of zero-days to the MSS48 include several

competitions

programs, 
underscoring the success of this strategy.

  Box 2: Vulnerability Disclosure Programs 
There are many actors involved in the search and 
discovery of zero days, including government 
agencies and private companies. A new vulnerabil-
ity, when found, can be used for either offense – 
attacking others – or defense – getting it patched. 
Various vulnerability disclosure processes exist, 
with distinctions based on whether the discover-
ing entity is from the private sector or a govern-
ment agency. These processes are classified as Co-
ordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) for pri-
vate sector entities and Government Disclosure 
Decision Processes (GDDP) for government agen-
cies. 
 
When private researchers uncover new vulnerabil-
ities, ethical disclosure practices come into play. 
These include a responsible and coordinated effort 
to inform relevant stakeholders, such as software 
vendors or system administrators, about the iden-
tified vulnerabilities. CVD emphasizes transparent 
and timely communication. Via this process, re-
searchers privately inform the affected party or 
parties, such as software vendors, service provid-
ers, or system administrators, about the identified 
vulnerability. This ensures that a fix or patch can 
be developed and deployed before the details of 
the vulnerability are made public.  
 
When government agencies, such as military cyber 
units or intelligence agencies, discover or purchase 
a new vulnerability, they face a binary decision: to 
keep it secret and stockpile it for later use or to dis-
close it to the appropriate vendor so that it can be 
fixed. GDDP consists of coordinating the sharing of 
vulnerability information between relevant stake-
holders through a government-led process, to de-
termine whether and how to disclose the exist-
ence of discovered vulnerabilities and their mitiga-
tion. An example is the U.S. Vulnerabilities Equities 
Process (VEP), initially developed in the late 2000s 
but publicly acknowledged only in 2016. 
 
Upon disclosure, the new vulnerabilities are as-
sessed by relevant vendors or agencies before be-
ing assigned a criticality level or score and pub-
lished in relevant vulnerability databases, i.e. pub-
lic centralized repositories of information about 
known vulnerabilities in various software, operat-
ing systems, and applications. This centralized ac-
cess streamlines the vulnerability management 
process by providing a single point of reference for 
security teams across several vendors, allowing for 
swift mitigation of vulnerabilities.

DEFCON CTF 
(2013-2023) 
This section traces the history and performance of 
Chinese hacking teams that participated in DEFCON 
CTF (2013-2023), and the impact they had on shaping 
China's offensive cybersecurity culture. It specifically 
examines the teams’ affiliations with academic 
institutions and corporate entities, as well as the 
extent of their involvement in military-civil fusion 
initiatives aimed at supporting state-sponsored 
offensive cyber operations.  
 
49 “DEF CON CTF Finals: An Inside View,” VMRAY, September 24, 2018, 
https://www.vmray.com/cyber-security-blog/def-con-ctf-finals-an-inside-
Founded by Jeff Moss in 1992, DEFCON takes place an-
nually in Las Vegas, Nevada, and is the largest hacking 
conference in the world. DEFCON’s own CTF competi-
tion was first held in 1996.  
 
Broadly speaking, there are two types of CTF competi-
tions: Jeopardy and Attack-Defense. Jeopardy covers a 
broad spectrum of skills, including reverse engineer-
ing, web, binary exploitation, and cryptography. It is 
best described as a digital treasure hunt in which 
hacking teams compete to find vulnerabilities in a sys-
tem. The teams must solve security challenges and 
puzzles that mimic real-world hacking scenarios to 
earn points. The goal is to ‘capture the flag,’(CTF) 
which is usually a hidden piece of data or code that – 
once it is found – serves as proof that a hack was suc-
cessful.  
 
In contrast to this, Attack-Defense competitions allow 
participants to attack each other. Each team is given 
access to a set of vulnerable services, identifiable by 
the presence of flags. The teams must subsequently 
seize these flags from their opponents to score 
points.49 Teams thus analyze a target program, iden-
tify vulnerabilities, and then develop exploits to com-
promise the other teams' machines by stealing their 
flags. At the same time, the team must patch its own 
systems to defend against similar attacks from the 
other team.  
 
The DEFCON CTF qualification system relies predomi-
nantly on Jeopardy-style CTFs. The DEFCON Finals fall 
under the Attack & Defense CTF category. In addition 
to succeeding in the qualifiers, teams can qualify for 
the finals by winning prominent global community 
events throughout the year or by succeeding in prior 
DEFCON CTF finals. Overall, DEFCON CTF primarily re-
volves around testing and improving individual hack-
ing skills in a controlled and legal environment. Cash 
prizes are typically awarded based on a team’s overall 
performance. This can vary from a few thousand to 
tens of thousands of US dollars. The prizes are distrib-
uted among the top teams that excel in different 
parts of the competition.

Key Points 
 
• Chinese teams consistently challenged US dom-
inance at DEFCON CTF from 2013 to 2023, with 
one to four teams advancing to the finals each 
year. 
 
• Participants, predominantly students but also 
including professionals, hail from a select group 
of elite universities. 
 
• Major Chinese technology and cybersecurity 
corporations provided sponsorship to top DEF-
CON CTF contenders, acquiring winning teams 
and offering attractive job benefits to recruit se-
curity experts. 
 
• The universities hosting DEFCON CTF teams 
have been (a) linked to Chinese state-sponsored 
cyber operations, (b) conducted vulnerability re-
search with Chinese companies that have been 
linked to Chinese state-sponsored cyber opera-
tions, or (c) serve as fertile recruitment centers 
for Chinese security agencies. One team has no-
tably strong connections with i-SOON. 
 
• Alumni from top teams have greatly enriched 
the offensive cyber ecosystem, establishing 
China-based Capture The Flag (CTF) competi-
tions and launching startups specialized in 
cyber ranges and automated vulnerability dis-
covery systems. These startups contribute zero-
day vulnerabilities to Chinese security agencies.

In 1996, DEFCON CTF started rather informally, with 
participants gathering and attempting to breach a 
server and retrieve a specific text file. Over time, the 
CTF evolved into a highly competitive challenge, at-
tracting participants from around the world. 
Throughout the 2000s, DEFCON CTF continued to 
grow in both size and complexity. Nowadays, the 
event is consistently drawing crowds of 25,000 to 
30,000 attendees, with teams competing in reverse 
engineering, network security, cryptography, and 
other areas to test their skills and knowledge.  
 
Chinese teams began to compete in DEFCON CTF in 
the 2010s, with the Blue Lotus team leading the way 
as the first Chinese team to qualify for the finals in 
2013. Chinese tech firms subsequently increased their 
participation rate by sending numerous teams to DEF-
CON and other conferences outside of China. Within 
the brief span of a few years, these Chinese teams rap-
idly evolved into formidable competitors. Between 
2013 and 2023, roughly one to four Chinese teams an-
nually secured a spot in the DEFCON CTF finals (see 
figure 3 for comprehensive ranking details).

In June 2012, Tsinghua University’s (THU) Blue Lotus 
team burst onto the international cybersecurity 
scene. Their debut performance at the DEFCON CTF 
Qualification Tournament was commendable. They 
secured the 19th position among a pool of over 500 
teams, coming very close to reaching the tourna-
ment's finals.50  
 
Throughout the latter half of 2012, the Blue Lotus 
team engaged in other internationally acclaimed CTF 
events, such as CSAW (USA), Hack.Lu (Luxembourg), 
RuCTFe (Russia), and Positive Hack Days CTF (Rus-
sia).51 Each contest proved to be crucial in honing the 
team’s technical abilities and refining their competi-
tive acumen. In December 2012 Blue Lotus reached 7th 
place in the prestigious 29C3 CTF competition (Ger-
many) that is organized by the Chaos Computer Club

cured a top eight rank in an internationally renowned 
hacking competition.52

In June 2013, the Blue Lotus team became the first 
Chinese team ever to qualify for the DEFCON CTF fi-
nals, securing the 4th place among 414+ contenders. 
In the finals, held later that year in Las Vegas, Blue Lo-
tus finished 11th of 20.53 The first place was won by 
Plaid Parliament of Pwning (PPP), Carnegie Mellon 
University’s (CMU) top performing hacking team. 
Throughout the rest of 2013, Blue Lotus achieved re-
markable rankings in CTF competitions across Ger-
many, South Korea, Iran, and the United States.54 
 
Year after year, Blue Lotus performances continued to 
astound observers, earning them more and more 
recognition in the cybersecurity community. In June 
2014, Blue Lotus exceeded expectations by once again

reaching the DEFCON CTF finals. This time securing 
the 5th place in the finals, with the top spot again be-
ing claimed by PPP.55  Blue Lotus’ success extended 
once again to various international CTF competitions, 
including the CodeGate Finals (South Korea), PlaidCTF 
(USA), ASIS (Iran), Pwnium (Tunisia), HITCON (Tai-
wan), and Hack.Lu (Luxembourg).56 According to 
CTFtime – the premier CTF competition archive – Blue 
Lotus solidified its overall global standing in Novem-
ber 2014, ranking 16th globally and 2nd in Asia.57

In 2015, Blue Lotus replicated its success of the previ-
ous year, securing 5th place at the DEFCON CTF finals. 
PPP trailed in second place behind DEFKOR from 
South Korea.58 During the same event, another Chi-
nese team, the "0ops" team from Shanghai Jiao Tong 
University (SJTU), made a noteworthy entrance into 
the finals too, finishing just one position below Blue 
Lotus.59 Before joining DEFCON CTF, the SJTU team 
had already garnered recognition in various CTF com-
petitions, securing 2nd place at Hack.lu CTF (Luxem-
bourg) and 6th place at HITCON CTF (Taiwan) in 
2014.60 The encounter between the Blue Lotus and 
0ops inspired an alliance between the two teams, 
leading to the birth of "b10op".61

In 2016, the newly born b10op team achieved new 
records for China, placing 2nd in the DEFCON CTF fi-
nals, with only PPP surpassing them in the ranking.62 
Recognizing the increased interest and success of Chi-
nese teams in CTF competitions, SJTU partnered up 
with Chinese tech giant Tencent to run their own CTF 
competition, known as 0CTF/TCTF. Nowadays, 
0CTF/TCTF is known as one of the world’s largest and 
most difficult CTF competitions.63 
 
Between 2016 and early 2017 some changes occurred 
in the teams. The core members of the original Blue 
Lotus team reorganized themselves into a new team 
named the "Tea Deliverers."  The Tea Deliverers se-
cured the 5th place in the DEFCON CTF finals in 2017.64 
The 0ops team meanwhile joined forces with the 
“eee” team (Tencent Keen Security Lab), the   "*****" 
team (Fudan University), and the “AAA” team 
(Zhejiang University (ZHU)) to create the new Tencent 
“A*0*E” team. A*0*E placed 3rd in the 2017 DEFCON 
CTF finals.65 The Tea Deliverers team and Tencent’s 
A*0*E team steadily solidified their positions in the 
global CTF rankings.  
 
Between 2017 and 2020, Tencent A*0*E consistently 
maintained its standing among the top teams, 
achieving a historic victory at the 2020 DEFCON CTF 
by surpassing Carnegie Mellon University's PPP team 
for the very first time.66 In that same year, the Tea De-
liverers secured the 4th place67 while the Chinese 
team r3kapig qualified to the finals for the first time, 
and ranked 14th. Supported by JD.com, China's largest 
online retailer, r3kapig is conceptualized as a collabo-
rative team that comprises the Chinese team Flap-
pyPig, former champions at XCTF and 0CTF/TCTF, 
along with a team known as Eur3kA.68 Eur3kA was es-
tablished by a former Blue Lotus member – also 
known as Atum69 – in collaboration with his class-
mates at Peking University.70

In 2018 and 2019, DEFCON hosted two events in Bei-
jing, known as “DEFCON China [Beta]” and “DEFCON 
China 1.0.” The initiative to bring DEFCON to China 
was spearheaded by Ma Jie, who at the time served as 
the head of the Security Division at the Chinese tech 
giant Baidu.71 Baidu, which had previously collabo-
rated with and sponsored the Blue Lotus team, also 
managed the CTF competition featured in both 
events.72 At the 2019 edition, the top spot was 
claimed by the Japanese team TokyoWesterns, with 
the Russian team LC↯BC securing the 2nd position. 
Chinese teams A*0*E and Never Stop Exploiting (Uni-
versity of the Chinese Academy of Sciences) achieved 
the 3rd and 5th rankings, respectively.73 
 
Between 2021 and 2022, the A*0*E team started to 
compete under the name "Katzebin," securing 1st 
place at DEFCON CTF in 2021, and 2nd at DEFCON CTF 
2022.74 The Chinese team r3kapig secured the 15th 
and 12th place, while Tea Deliverers ranked 3rd in 
2021, marking the latter’s last participation in the 
event.75 In both years, a new team named “Nu1L” en-
tered the finals, placing 7th in both years.   
 
Established in 2015, Nu1L claims a membership ex-
ceeding 90 individuals, hailing from prestigious insti-
tutions like THU, Peking University, and Shanghai Uni-
versity of Science and Technology, as well as major do-
mestic security firms such as Alibaba, Tencent, and 
Huawei.76 In 2018, Nu1L established its own Jeop-
ardy-style contest, named N1CTF.  
 
In 2023, DEFCON altered its rules, decreasing the 
number of finalist teams from 15 to 12. This measure 
incentivized participation through collaborations 
among various teams. Chinese teams equally entered 
the competition through various international part-
nerships. These teams included "P1G_BuT_S4D," 
which joined forces between r3kapig and the Russian 
team "C4T BuT S4D"77; "Blue Water," a collaboration 
between Tea Deliverers, pb_ctf, Water_Paddler, and 
Samsung Research; and "Straw Hat," which brought

together Nu1L, W&M, and other independent re-

from U.S.-based Northwestern University. 78 These 
teams ranked respectively 2nd, 5th and 7th.  
 
W&M, a Chinese team result of a merger between the 
MxM and W&P teams, comprises both students and 
professionals. It's difficult to discern the specific uni-
versities and companies associated with the mem-
bers of W&M or determine when the team was 
founded based on their website. W&M established its 
own competition in 2020, named WMCTF. The 2023 
WMCTF edition was supported by i-SOON as the pri-
mary sponsor, the government-contracted firm 
whose extensive espionage activities were exposed in 
early 2024.79  The WMCTF website clarifies that it has 
“no other affiliations” and none of its members are 
employed by i-SOON (figure 5). Although this asser-
tion couldn't be verified in this report, this collabora-
tion represents the closest connection between a top-
performing team at DEFCON CTF and Chinese state-
sponsored espionage efforts.

In summary, since the early 2010s, prominent Chinese 
universities have actively nurtured their students' tal-
ents to excel in the DEFCON CTF competition, result-
ing in a growing number of outstanding achieve-
ments. Early Chinese participation, spearheaded by 
THU's Blue Lotus team, swiftly gained momentum as 
other universities and companies followed suit. These 
teams have played a pivotal role in shaping the cyber-
security landscape in China itself. They established 
some of the world's premier CTF competitions (figure 
6) and began to offer incentives to Chinese students 
for cultivating their own hacking skills. Retired team 
members often created their own cyber security 
startup, providing niche digital services, such as cyber 
ranges and automated vulnerability discovery sys-
tems, to companies and government agencies alike.   
 
As the nurturing of Chinese cybersecurity talent ad-
vances, universities and CTF competitions naturally 
establish a talent pipeline and domestic capability 
that Chinese defense and security agencies can tap 
into. In China this is particularly pronounced due to 
the government’s MCF strategy, which blurs the lines 
between civilian and military research and applica-
tion.

Indeed, Chinese universities have been linked to Chi-
nese state-sponsored cyber espionage activities.80 
The universities associated with sending teams to 
participate at DEFCON CTF are no exception to this. 
Chinese DEFCON CTF participation is to a large degree 
an undertaking by a small number of technical univer-
sities – namely THU, SJTU ZHU, and Fudan University 
– within what is known as the C9 League (九校联盟). 
The C9 League is made up of nine elite Chinese uni-
versities (figure 7) that are given preferential treat-
ment by the state as part of the Chinese Communist 
Party’s Project 985 initiative. Founded in 1998, Project 
985 is designed to efficiently allocate regional and na-
tional resources to selected universities to improve 
existing infrastructure, develop research centers, and 
to conduct international events.81 Members of the C9 
League thus receive substantial financial and political 
support from Beijing and local governments.82 
 
To put this in numbers: The C9 League members host 
a mere 3% of China’s research scholars but receive

10% of the China’s national research budget and pro-
duce 20% of cited academic papers in China.83 They 
are also given priority for grants and other privileges. 
Admission to a C9 university is highly competitive and 
considered a mark of excellence. According to the U.S. 
News Rankings, THU, SJTU, and ZHU rank among the 
top 15 universities globally in the field of computer 
science.84

Like other Chinese universities, The Ministry of Educa-
tion oversees the C9 League. Yet, the league members 
(except for Fudan University) also belong to a small 
group of universities that are overseen by MIIT and 
the State Administration of Science, Technology, and 
Industry for National Defense (SASTIND).85 SASTIND 
mission is to transform the educational institutions it 
partners with into “universities with national defense 
characteristics” by expanding their engagement in 
defense technology training and research while deep-
ening their collaboration with Chinese defense com-
panies.86 This includes supporting the establishment 
of defense research laboratories, funding research ar-
eas related to defense, and facilitating their involve-
ment in military projects.  
 
The following subsections will examine the teams 
which have successfully competed at DEFCON CTF 
over the past decade. This includes THU’s Blue Lotus,

87 MIT stands for Massachusetts Institute of Technology, based in the US. Re-
nowned worldwide for its laboratory instruction, the MIT focuses on programs 
in applied science and engineering. It has been ranked as the No. 1 university 
in the world by QS World University Rankings for 11 straight years. 
SJTU’s 0ops, and ZHU’s AAA teams, each comprising 
between 20 and slightly over 40 members in any 
given year, as per the CTFtime database. Fudan Uni-
versity, despite being a C9 member itself, will not be 
included in the analysis due to its lower cyber risk pro-
file. To date it has not been publicly connected to any 
Chinese state-sponsored cyber operations.  
Tsinghua University (清华大学) is considered China’s 
top-ranking university in the field of science and tech-
nology. Often described as “China’s MIT,87” THU is 
ranked 1st globally in Computer Science, according to 
the 2024 U.S. News Rankings.88 This academic power-
house oversees a comprehensive network of over 390 
research institutions, including eight major defense 
laboratories which are pivotal in conducting classified 
research and development to support military ad-
vancements in the fields of, quantum physics, and nu-
clear technology. 89  
 
Each year, hundreds to thousands of THU students 
are funded by China’s defense industry conglomer-
ates.90 In 2020, THU and the PLA’s Academy of Military 
Science launched a program for the joint training of 
doctoral students in the computer science field. This 
makes the university a fertile recruitment ground for 
the PLA and other Chinese government agencies.91 
While collaborations between universities and the de-
fense sector are not uncommon in Western countries, 
the Chinese system goes a bit further. For example, 
the government will assess universities and their per-
sonnel for patriotic education and ideological adher-
ence. As such, THU – and the other C9 League mem-
bers – place significant emphasis on being both "Red 
and Expert[s]," a concept that emphasized in its an-
nual budget report.92

In 2018, Chinese state-sponsored network reconnais-
sance activities were linked to infrastructure associ-
ated with THU. The activities were aimed against tar-
gets in Alaska, Kenya, Brazil, and Mongolia during 
times of economic dialogue and publicity related to 
China's investments in foreign infrastructure pro-
jects.93 As of this writing, it is unknown whether Blue 
Lotus team members are involved in the Chinese 
state-sponsored cyber espionage operations. That be-
ing said, in recent years, THU has entered several re-
search partnerships with prominent Chinese cyberse-
curity companies that have in turn been (a) involved 
in state-sponsored cyber espionage campaigns or (b) 
are known for providing Chinese government agen-
cies with zero-day vulnerabilities. These include Qihoo 
360, Qi An Xin, NSFOCUS, and Saining Network Secu-
rity.94 Among other subject matters, THU’s coopera-
tive research efforts with these entities includes soft-
ware vulnerability analysis. This might indicate that 
THU students could contribute to the vulnerability re-
search at these companies, whose result would in 
turn likely contribute to the evaluation of vulnerabili-
ties for the potential application in state-sponsored 
cyber operations.  
 
In 2010, THU’s Blue Lotus team was founded by three 
professors hailing from Tsinghua’s Network and In-
formation Security Laboratory.95 As previously noted, 
the Blue Lotus team’s achievements had a profound 
influence on the CTF competition culture in China. 
However, the most immediate result was the influ-
ence these successes had on fellow Chinese students. 
In the early stages of Blue Lotus’ success, the team be-
came so well-known that students from other univer-
sities, including ZHU and SJTU, sought to join the 
team. Due to the team's maximum size of 20 mem-
bers, only one to two new students were able to join 
every year.96 While some non-THU students were al-
lowed to join the team in the beginning, the composi-

tion of the Blue Lotus team shifted back to predomi-
nantly THU students as more universities formed 
their own CTF teams.97 
 
Between 2013-2014, Blue Lotus joined forces with the 
Baidu Research Institute to establish the Baidu CTF 
(BCTF) competition. BCTF was the first Chinese CTF 
competition that adopted the Attack-Defense for-
mat.98 BCTF attracted participation from over 2,500 
individuals, emerging as the largest network security 
competition in the country at the time.99 In 2018 and 
2019, BCTF took place in Beijing as part of DEFCON 
China [Beta] and DEFCON China 1.0.

From 2014 to 2015, Blue Lotus then spearheaded the 
founding of the XCTF International League, an Attack-
Defense style CTF competition hosted by Nanjing 
Saining Network Security.100 At its inaugural event, 
XCTF reportedly attracted 3,847 teams and over 
10,000 participants, surpassing BCTF by a significant

margin. In the second edition, the XCTF International 
League drew participation from over 20,000 teams, 
including the then top 10 ranked CTF teams in the 
world, and more than 40,000 individuals.101  In 2017, 
Saining Network Security claimed that XCTF became 
“the world’s second and Asia’s first cyber security 
competition.”102 
 
In 2016, Blue Lotus’ most senior members established 
a new team, named the Tea Deliverers, in the hopes 
of improving their performance at DEFCON CTF, 
where Blue Lotus placed 5th in the previous year. Be-
tween 2017 to 2021, the Tea Deliverers ranked each 
year in the top 6 of the DEFCON CTF finals. With the 
senior members performing independently, THU 
stood up a team named “Redbud,” which is specifi-
cally geared toward skill enhancement and learning, 
rather than winning a CTF competition.103 As such, 
Redbud serves as a platform for young THU students 
to practice their technical abilities and interact and 
learn from more accomplished CTF players. The team 
also serves as a talent pool and substitute bench the 
Blue Lotus and Tea Deliverers team can tap into.  
 
The most distinguished Blue Lotus and the Tea Deliv-
erers alumni went on to establish their own IT security 
companies.104 These include Nanjing Saining Net-
work Security and StarCross Technology.  
 
Nanjing Saining Network Security, also known as 
Cyber Peace (赛宁网安), was established in Nanjing in 
2013 by a former Blue Lotus member.105 Within the 
Chinese CTF community, Saining is probably most 
well-known for sponsoring and organizing XCTF.106

being the primary promoter and organizer of XCTF to 
specializing in delivering software and hardware se-
curity solutions. It has a particular emphasis on cyber 
ranges, including those based on digital twin technol-
ogy.  A cyber range digital twin is a virtual representa-
tion of a network or cyber system created to simulate 
and test its behavior in a controlled environment.107 
Similar to traditional digital twins, which replicate 
real-world objects, this concept allows organizations 
to monitor and optimize their network's performance 
without risking damage to the actual system.  
 
According to a 2021 article by Sohu.com, Saining is 
aiming to become “the world’s number one brand of 
cyber shooting ranges.”108 The company has clientele 
and partnerships with military and intelligence agen-
cies. According to the company’s own website, its 
products have received recognition from military cus-
tomers, although the specific military organizations 
involved are not explicitly mentioned.109 Saining also 
serves as technical support unit (TSU) for the MSS-op-
erated CNNVD vulnerability database.110 
 
As reported by Sohu.com, the foundation of Saining 
Network Security's core technology research and de-
velopment is deeply rooted in its close relationship 
with THU and the Blue Lotus team, leveraging a vast 
and influential network of expertise.111 According to 
PitchBook.com’s 
financial 
database 
and 
techi-
nasia.com, a technology news site,  Saining employs 
up to 200 individuals112 and carries an estimated 
overall valuation of 62 million USD.113 Sohu.com also 
notes that many of its key technical talents have pre-
viously held significant roles at industry giants like 
ZTE, Huawei, Alibaba, and Microsoft. The company 
has established partnerships with renowned corpora-
tions and government entities, encompassing but not 
limited to Huawei, TikTok’s Bytedance, China Mobile 
Group, Telecom Group, State Grid, and China Re-
sources Group.114

Saining Network Security has also partnered with 
prestigious domestic universities, including THU, 
Nanjing University, and Fudan University. These part-
nerships included the development of six cybersecu-
rity courses covering areas such as hacking competi-
tion skills and vulnerability mining.115 This training 
package reportedly comprised more than 1,200 hours 
of original, high-quality courses and incorporates over 
3,000 practice questions, facilitating the integration 
of theoretical knowledge with practical application 
during training and testing.116 
 
Saining has also been forging partnerships globally. 
These collaborations extend to countries such as Sin-
gapore, Chile, Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Pakistan, and over 
10 nations associated with the Belt and Road initia-
tive. It is unclear whether Saining’s global partner-
ships are with foreign private companies, government 
agencies, or both.  
 
StarCross Technology, also known as Xinglan Technol-
ogy (星阑科技), is a cybersecurity startup that was es-
tablished in Beijing in 2018 by a former Blue Lotus 
member.117 StarCross specializes in securing applica-
tion programming interfaces (APIs), employing AI for 
situation awareness, monitoring, and emergency re-
sponse solutions to protect companies from cyber 
threats. Among its main products is a fully automated 
Intelligent Vulnerability Discovery System.118 As per 
the company's website, this system can autono-
mously detect vulnerabilities across different busi-
ness scenarios, eliminating the necessity for manual 
intervention. Although specific details about its part-
nerships and collaborations are not disclosed, 
StarCross, like Saining Network, is a technical support 
unit (TSU) of the MSS-operated CNNVD.119

both support operations and conduct research to en-
hance cyber capabilities.”129 As early as 2010, an in-
vestigation into Operation Aurora, a cyber campaign 
that targeted Google and several other American 
companies, traced the origins of these intrusions to 
computers at SJTU.130 
 
SJTU faculty members have also co-authored tech-
nical research papers with members of PLA Unit 
61398, also known as APT1, on topics related to com-
puter network security and intrusion detection.131 A 
2013 Reuters investigation accused SJTU’s School of 
Information Security Engineering – which hosts the 
0ops team132 –of providing direct support to the cyber 
operations of PLA Unit 61398.133 The same investiga-
tion also uncovered that SJTU’s Department of Com-
puter Science and Engineering – which reportedly 
conducted research with another unspecified PLA 
Unit – sits right across the street from the National In-
formation Security Engineering Center, a building 
commissioned in 2003 by PLA Unit 61398 (APT1).134 In 
2014, The New York Times reported that one of the 
hackers affiliated with Unit 61398  had utilized his 
SJTU university email address to register a web do-
main used in several malicious cyber operations.135 
 
In his report titled "Academics, AI, and APTs," Dakota 
Cary emphasized the involvement of another SJTU-af-
filiated entity in Chinese cyber operations, known as 
the Cyberspace Security Science and Technology Re-
search Institute. The Institute’s Network Confronta-
tion and Information System Security Testing project 
covers items such as APT attack testing and defense. 
The project’s research priorities also show a specific 
emphasis on crafting technologies tailored for APT 
cyber operations, alongside password cracking and 
social engineering.

Lastly, SJTU operates its own vulnerability database, 
i.e. the Higher-Ed Vulnerability Database, which col-
lects vulnerability reports from a range of sources, in-
cluding submissions from Chinese researchers, pro-
fessors, and university students.136 These reports 
largely cover products that are utilized by all institu-
tions under the supervision of China's Ministry of Ed-
ucation. It is believed that ultimately, these reports 
will find their way to the MSS.137 
 
SJTU serves as the home base for the 0ops team, es-
tablished in 2013. The team gained prominence 
through its success in the hacking competition Co-
deGate2015 (South Korea), becoming the first Chi-
nese team to secure an international CTF champion-
ship. 0ops also participated in the 2015 DEFCON CTF 
finals and placed 6th. From 2016 onwards, 0ops 
formed a strategic partnership by jointly competing 
with Tencent's eee team at the DEFCON CTF finals. A 
key legacy of this collaboration was the creation of the 
0CTF/TCTF 
competition 
in 
2017. 
Since 
2017, 
0CTF/TCTF has attracted more 5,000 teams from 
across the globe, including the US, Russia, Japan, Po-
land, South Korea, and Germany.138 This partnership 
also functions as a significant talent pipeline from 
SJTU to Tencent vulnerability research labs, known for 
providing government agencies with zero-day vulner-
abilities.139 Many of the most distinguished SJTU and 
0ops alumni work for Tencent Keen Security Lab.140

Zhejiang University (浙江大学) ranks 12th globally in 
Computer Science, according to the U.S. News Rank-
ings.142 Like THU and SJTU, it stands out for its sub-
stantial presence of defense laboratories, close asso-
ciations with the defense industry, and connections 
to state-sponsored economic and espionage activi-
ties.143  
 
A 2012 report, commissioned for the US–China Eco-
nomic and Security Review Commission, revealed 
ZHU received funding from the MSS for research in 
“sensitive research and development with infor-
mation security and information warfare applica-
tions.”144 In 2013, US officials in Milwaukee arrested 
Huajun Zhao, a cancer researcher from China, on 
charges related to economic espionage. The FBI's 
statement implied that Zhao may have leveraged his 
position at the Medical College of Wisconsin to illicitly 
obtain patented research material and potentially 
transferred that material to ZHU.145 Despite these ac-
tivities, public reporting has not yet established any 
direct ties between ZHU and Chinese malicious cyber 
campaigns. 
 
ZHU's School of Computer Science and Technology 
hosts the renowned AAA team. Founded in 2012, AAA 
is the most well-known CTF team in China that has 
specialized in reverse binary.146 Its graduates are 
highly valued by both the Chinese private sector and 
government bodies, including those involved in state-
sponsored cyber espionage activities. ZHU students 
conduct leading vulnerability research, notably 
through the university’s Ubiquitous Systems Security 
(USS) Lab.147 Their research scope encompasses the 
Internet of Things (IoT) and AI security, as well as au-
tonomous vehicles. Two ZHU students successfully

Beijing, earning them a 10.000 USD bounty. ZHU stu-
dents and USS Lab members are enshrined in the 
Tesla Security Researcher Hall of Fame for both 2014 
and 2016.148 
 
The most distinguished AAA alumni have gone on to 
join leading vulnerability research facilities, such as 
Huawei’s Singular Security Lab and the Tencent Keen 
Security Lab. Some have also been recruited by gov-
ernmental entities. In 2013, a Mandiant report char-
acterized ZHU's School of Computer Science and 
Technology– the department that hosts ZHU’s AAA 
team149 – as a source for recruiting individuals into 
PLA Unit 61398 (APT1).150 
 
Some other alumni present a different narrative. For-
mer AAA team captain and current Senior Director of 
Shaechi Security Lab, He Qidan (also known as Edward 
Flanker) embarked on his academic journey at ZHU at 
the early age of 15.151 He gained international fame 
by achieving victory in Pwn2Own as a part of the Ten-
cent Keen Security Lab Team at the age of 22. During 
the same period, he actively participated in DEFCON 
CTF and has been a featured speaker at prestigious 
hacking conferences such as Black Hat and Can-
SecWest. In 2020, while employed as Cyber Security 
Head at Pinduoduo, China’s third-largest e-commerce 
firm after Alibaba and JD.com, there were reports of 
his forced expulsion from the company after over four 
years of service.152 In a Weibo post made in January 
2021, he declared his departure from Pinduoduo due 
to the company's plans to involve him in unlawful ac-
tions against his will, a stance he reaffirmed in later 
posts. 
 
While Pinduoduo did not face any punitive actions by 
state regulators, several senior researchers expressed

their anger at Pinduoduo.153 The former director of 
Alibaba Group's Security Research Laboratory re-
sponded to one of Qidan’s posts, stating that "The 
brilliant hackers in our hacker community, who were 
wronged by Pinduoduo, deserve hundreds of millions 
in compensation and bonus options. Capital goes to 
great lengths to exploit its employees. Entry-level 
workers are worn out, and technical talents are de-
pleted." The founder of Tencent Keen Security Lab also 
expressed concerns, mentioning that "During Flank-
er's tenure at Pinduoduo for over a year, he frequently 
met and discussed with me after work at night. He 
disclosed that Pinduoduo’s management coerced him 
into undertaking illegal tasks and created various ob-
stacles for him after he refused… Prior to Flanker's re-
cent departure, he reached out to me again when 
Pinduoduo created difficulties for him due to his re-
fusal to engage in illegal activities."154 This instance 
demonstrated the commitment of China's top-tier 
hackers to high ethical standards. It remains unclear 
to what extent this stance extends to national secu-
rity issues. 
 
Two cybersecurity companies created by AAA alumni 
are important for this report: Chaitin Tech and Bolean 
Technology. 
Chaitin Tech (长亭科技) is a cybersecurity firm 
founded in Beijing in 2014 by Blue Lotus and AAA 
alumni.155 The company focuses on application fire-
walls and vulnerability scanning, along with providing 
penetration testing and emergency response services. 
One of the company’s founders is Yusen Chen, former

speech at Black Hat in 2015157, and was listed in 
Forbes's Asia 30 Under 30 list for Enterprise Technol-
ogy in 2017. Chaitin has garnered strong recognition 
in the cybersecurity and technology industry, ranking 
first in the China Top 100 "Artificial Intelligence and 
Robotics" companies by Fortune Magazine in 2017 
and being included in the Top 25 Global Network Se-
curity Leaders by U.S.-based Cyber Defense Maga-
zine.158 
 
Towards the end of 2017, after performing at 
Pwn2Own, Chaitin received directives from the Chi-
nese government to cease further participation in in-
ternational hacking competitions.159 In response, the 
company publicly committed to prioritizing the sub-
mission of vulnerabilities to the MSS-operated 
CNNVD database, for which it now also serves as a 
technical support unit (TSU).160 Chaitin also initiated 
its own global jeopardy-style CTF competition in Bei-
jing in 2018, named Real World CTF161, which attracts 
top CTF teams from China and around the world.162 
 
In 2019, Chaitin was acquired by Alibaba Cloud – itself 
a top-tier zero-day supplier to the MSS163 – while re-
taining its own brand. As of this writing, Chaitin pro-
vides services to multiple Chinese industries and sec-
tors, spanning from finance and internet sectors to 
government, enterprise, communication, healthcare, 
education, and various other industries.164 According 
to information sourced from the enterprise financial 
database Crunchbase, Chaitin Tech has a workforce of 
around 100 employees and holds an estimated value 
of approximately 19 million USD.165

outlet anquan419, Bolean Technology serves clients 
in various industries, including the defense sector, as 
well as energy and manufacturing.168 In particular, it 
provides defense-oriented industrial control system 
solutions aimed at safeguarding the production of 
weapons and military equipment from cyber 
threats.169  
 
According to PitchBook, the company employs up to 
150 individuals.170 It operates its own research labor-
atory named Friday Lab, which conducts research in 
the field of ICS cybersecurity. Bolean's technical team, 
predominantly consisting of members and alumni 
from ZHU’s AAA team171, relies heavily on expertise in

company has “discovered 1000+ vulnerabilities” of 
which “66 are original vulnerabilities” (the term ‘orig-
inal’ likely refers to zero-days).173 Bolean serves as a

Pwn2Own       
(2014-2017) 
This section traces the history and performance of 
Chinese 
hacking 
teams 
that 
participated 
in 
Pwn2Own (2014-2017). It specifically examines 
analyzes the competing teams, their areas of 
expertise and affiliations with corporate entities, as 
well as the extent of their involvement in military-
civil fusion initiatives aimed at supporting state-
sponsored offensive cyber operations.  
 
175 “Over $1 Million Awarded in Pwn2Own Hacking Competition,” Trend Micro 
(blog), March 27, 2023, 1, https://newsroom.trendmicro.com/2023-03-27-
Over-1-Million-Awarded-in-Pwn2Own-Hacking-Competition. 
The annual hacking competition Pwn2Own was 
founded in 2007 as part of the CanSecWest confer-
ence in Vancouver, Canada. Starting in 2017, 
Pon2Own was held twice a year, featuring separate 
events targeting desktops and mobile devices. The 
competition derives its name from the hacker term 
"pwn" (pronounced "own"), meaning to compromise 
or control a computer system. Pwn2Own challenges 
participants to exploit specific software and operat-
ing systems to identify zero-days. Participants at-
tempt to pwn or take control of these software sys-
tems by identifying and exploiting weaknesses. What 
makes Pwn2Own stand out from other competitions 
in this space is that the hacks are performed against 
fully patched and up-to-date systems. Hackers there-
fore have to find innovative ways and leverage previ-
ously unknown vulnerabilities to pwn a machine. 
Pwn2Own is often used to demonstrate new tech-
niques and zero-days to show how a system can be 
compromised in the here and now. Over the years, 
Pwn2Own has grown in popularity, attracting tal-
ented hackers and security researchers from across 
the globe. The competition has become a pivotal plat-
form for highlighting the real-world risks associated 
with software vulnerabilities. 
 
Pwn2Own distinguishes itself by providing substan-
tial cash prizes for successful exploits. Reward details 
are disclosed before the competition begins and vary 
based on the targeted software and the severity of the 
exploits. Over the years, targets have included web 
browsers, plugins, and operating systems like Win-
dows, macOS, and various mobile platforms. Between 
2014-2017, the total prize pool ranged from 460.000 
USD to 850.000 USD. From 2018 to 2013, the total 
prize pool was between 1 million to 2 million USD. Top 
performers could earn up to 530.000 USD in the con-
test’s 2023 edition.175 
 
Pwn2Own is often sponsored by technology compa-
nies and organizations interested in enhancing their 
software's security. These prizes are powerful incen-
Key Points 
 
• Chinese winnings at Pwn2Own surged from 
13% in 2014 to 79% of the total prize money 
awarded to all participants. Participants are 
mostly professionals from companies Qihoo 
360 and Tencent. 
 
• Qihoo 360 boasts at least 19 teams and labs 
spanning various product lines and depart-
ments. Tencent hosts 7 to 10 teams and labs 
organized within one unified department. 
 
• The Pangu Team showcased exceptional skills 
in Apple mobile hacking, gaining recognition 
at various international competitions. 
 
• Pangu Team is now part of Qi An Xin, which is 
deeply connected to China’s government 
agencies. Qi An Xin acted as a primary contrac-
tor, competitor, and potential investor for i-
SOON. 
 
• Qihoo 360 and Qi An Xin exhibit high integra-
tion and involvement in MCF activities. Ten-
cent's relationship with the government has 
been more strained in recent years. 
 
• In 2018, China barred researchers from at-
tending Pwn2Own in 2018 and initiated the 
Tianfu Cup, its own equivalent competition.

tives for participants to uncover and report vulnera-
bilities responsibly to the vendors, rather than ex-
ploiting them maliciously. In 2015, Pwn2Own was ac-
quired by the Zero Day Initiative, which is part of US 
cybersecurity company TrendMicro.176  Pwn2Own has 
evolved over the years, introducing new target cate-
gories, such as Internet of Things (IoT) devices.  
 
In contrast to the gradual ascent of Chinese teams in 
international CTF competitions, Chinese participants 
had an immediate impact when they started to 
participate in Pwn2Own in 2013. While most Chinese 
teams consist mainly of Chinese citizens, some 
Chinese teams also included researchers from other 
countries, such as Australia and Italy. The Chinese 
teams achieved outstanding results in Pwn2Own, 
achieving dominance within the span of a few years. 
 
However, the impact was short-lived. In 2017, Chinese 
cybersecurity firm Qihoo 360's CEO, Zhou Hongyi, 
publicly expressed concerns about Chinese citizens 
participating in overseas hacking competitions. He 
argued that their expertise should stay in China, 
emphasizing the strategic value of vulnerabilities. The 
Chinese government subsequently banned Chinese 
cybersecurity researchers from participating in 
international exploit competitions such as Pwn2Own, 
leading to the creation of the Tianfu Cup in Chengdu 
in November 2018. 
In 2013, a Chinese hacking team – known as Keen 
Team – triumphed in the Mobile Pwn2Own contest 
(Tokyo, Japan) by successfully breaching Apple iOS 
version 7.0.3.177 In 2014, the Keen Team also won the 
prestigious Pwn2Own contest (Vancouver, Canada) –

exploits to breach Apple’s Safari 7 browser and Adobe 
Flash.179 These milestones firmly established the 
Keen Team as the first Chinese team to assert 
dominance in finding zero-day vulnerabilities in both 
desktop and mobile operating systems. 
The Keen Team was led by Wang Qi, the then 37-year-
old CEO of the parent company Keen Cloud Tech 
(Xuhui, Shanghai). His background included prior 
employment as a technical leader at Microsoft’s 
China security response center, and he held the team 
to exceptionally high standards. Wang emphasized 
the rigor of rigid selection and training criteria of its 
team, comparable to that of corporate tech giants.180 
One of their standout members, Chen Liang, claimed 
to have locked himself in a rented room for two 
months to remove all potential distractions to 
conduct intensive code analysis for Windows 8.1, 
Adobe Flash, and Apple's Safari in preparation of the 
Pwn2Own competition.181 Chen's commitment bore 
substantial rewards, as he managed to hack each of 
the three programs.182  
The Keen Team's co-founder and COO of Keen Cloud, 
Lu Yiping, shared insights into their team composition 
with VICE’s tech outlet Motherboard. Half of the 
members were top scorers in the national college 
entrance 
examination 
and 
specialized 
in 
mathematics. Their backgrounds included esteemed 
educational institutions like SJTU and Fudan 
University, and professional experience at tech giants 
such as Microsoft and Tencent. This diverse blend of 
talent formed the core of the Keen Team.183  
Bolstered by the team’s growing success, the Keen 
Team established GeekPwn, an event modeled after 
Pwn2Own, which focuses on the security smart-life 
devices and AI.184 First held in Beijing in 2014 and 
continuing today under the name GeekCon, this 
annual event was established during a period when

most of these companies declined invitations to 
participate 
in 
hacking 
competitions, 
fearing 
reputational damage. Some even made efforts to 
disrupt GeekPwn’s inaugural event.186

The Keen Team was not the sole contributor to 
China's rise during that time. At the China-based 2014 
SyScan +360 security conference, sponsored by the 
Chinese cybersecurity giant Qihoo 360, two ZHU 
students successfully penetrated the electronic 
system of a Tesla Model S electric vehicle. They gained 
control over essential functions, such as door locks, 
horn, wipers, headlights, and sunroof.187  
Qihoo 360’s Vulcan team entered Pwn2Own for the 
very first time in 2015. It breached Internet Explorer 
11 and cracked Google Chrome, resulting in a 110.000 
USD payout.188 In 2015 the Keen Team was joined by 
members of the Tencent PC Manager team. Six hours 
into the competition, reports of victories flooded in.

total of 125.000 USD.189Within the span of just three 
years, the Keen Team became the world's first to 
"pwn" both Apple and Microsoft desktop operating 
system. In total, the Chinese teams won 42% (235.000 
USD) of the 557.000 USD large overall prize pool.190 
 
Following this achievement, the Keen Team and Ten-
cent PC Manager formally merged into the Tencent 
Keen Security Lab. Pwn2Own’s 2015 edition marked 
the participation of two of China’s most prominent 
tech giants, Qihoo 360 and Tencent, highlighting 
growing Chinese national interests and expanded ca-
pabilities in the field of critical vulnerability research 
and exploitation. 
 
After fully absorbing the Keen Team, Tencent entered 
Pwn2Own 2016 with three teams: Tencent Security 
Team Shield (from the Tencent Keen Security Lab), 
Tencent Security Team Sniper (also from the Tencent 
Keen Security Lab), and Tencent Security Xuanwu 
Lab.191 These teams demonstrated exceptional talent, 
with Tencent Security Team Shield successfully ex-
ploiting Apple’s Safari browser to achieve root-level 
code execution, earning them 40.000 USD.192 Mean-
while, Tencent Security Team Sniper carried out a 
hack against Adobe Flash Player on Windows for 
which they received 50.000 USD.193 Xuanwu Lab’s at-
tempt to exploit Adobe Flash in Microsoft Edge but 
failed. Overall, Tencent Security Team Sniper earned 
the title of “Master of Pwn” and a total prize pool of 
142.500 USD.194 Qihoo’s 360 Vulcan Team also partic-
ipated and secured 132.500 USD by demonstrating 
two exploits for Adobe Flash and Google Chrome, re-
spectively.195 In total, Chinese teams won 68% 
(315.000 USD) of the 460.000 USD large prize pool.196

The newly established Tencent Keen Security Lab also 
earned 215.000 USD in Pwn2Own’s 2016 Mobile con-
test, successfully hacking Apple's iPhone 6S and 
Google's Nexus 6P phones despite these products’ 
stringent security measures.197 This feat further con-
firmed the Keen Lab’s dominant role in hacking both 
desktop and mobile operating systems, with a focus 
on cutting-edge security research encompassing 
mainstream PC and mobile operating systems, appli-
cations, cloud computing technologies, and IoT de-
vices, among others.  
 
As Tencent’s performance in hacking competitions in 
2015 dramatically improved, Qihoo 360 held its 
ground. At the newly launched 2016 PwnFest hacking 
competition in Seoul, South Korea, Qihoo 360's Alpha 
team accomplished to breach the security protocols of 
Google's Android smartphone, the Google Pixel, in 
record time, winning them a 120.000 USD cash 
prize.198 By the event's conclusion, the Qihoo 360 
hackers were crowned "Lords of Pwn," amassing a to-
tal sum of 520.000 USD by showcasing an additional 
vulnerability within Microsoft Edge browser on Win-
dows 10, along with identifying a vulnerability within 
Adobe Flash.199

2016 PwnFest also saw the entry of a new Chinese 
team named Team Pangu. Pangu gained online fame 
for releasing a million-dollar Apple’s iPhone iOS jail-
break for free. Jailbreaking iOS was quite impressive 
due to the substantial complexities involved in Ap-
ple’s iPhone operating system. iOS security is essen-
tially stratified into three layers: the application layer, 
the system layer, and the kernel layer, each having 
progressively greater permissions. To execute a suc-
cessful jailbreak, one must attain kernel permissions, 
which in turn necessitates overcoming all the other 
security layers. Jailbreaks thus require the exploita-
tion of numerous vulnerabilities that work in concert 
to reach the kernel.  
 
Although relatively new to the competition, the 
Pangu Team immediately bolstered its reputation in 
the hacking community. At Pwnfest 2016, they dis-
covered an Apple Safari browser exploit that granted 
them root access, earning them 80.000 USD.200 
 
While in the 2016 Pwn2Own edition Chinese teams 
exerted significant influence, the 2017 edition was 
truly dominated by them. In 2017, the Qihoo 360’s Se-
curity team secured the top position by successfully 
exploiting MacOS, Safari, Adobe Reader, Adobe Flash, 
and Windows 10,201 winning them 255.000 USD.202 
They also managed to take down Microsoft Edge and 
escape a virtual machine in just 90 seconds, achieving 
the highest score in the event's history for a single en-
try.203 The 2nd to 5th places in the ranking were also 
claimed by Chinese groups, namely Tencent Security 
Team Sniper (from the Tencent Keen Lab), Chaitin Se-
curity Research Lab (from the company Chaitin Tech-
nology), Tencent Security Team Lance (from the Ten-
cent Zhanlu Lab), and Tencent Security Team Ether 
(from the Tencent Xuanwu Lab).

Tencent teams collectively earned 350.000 USD for 
successful exploits targeting VMware, Microsoft 
Edge, Adobe Flash, while Chaitin Security earned 
60.000 USD for successful exploits targeting Apple Sa-
fari browser, Ubuntu Linux, and the macOS kernel. In 
total, Chinese teams won 79% (665.000 USD) of the 
total 833.000 USD that were paid out.204 The elevated 
number of Tencent-affiliated teams underscored the 
continued expansion of the company into hacking 
contests over the years. 
 
The consistent dominance of Chinese hackers in 
Pwn2Own events significantly influenced the land-
scape of these competitions, establishing China as a 
major player and leading to millions in earnings for its 
research teams. Between 2014 and 2017, China's por-
tion of the prize money won by all contestants surged 
from 13% in 2014 to 42% in 2015, then to 68% in 2016, 
reaching its pinnacle at 79% in 2017 (figure 11). 
 
Following the 2017 Pwn2Own edition, it all stopped. 
In an interview with Chinese news outlet Sina, Qihoo 
360 CEO Zhou Hongyi vigorously criticized Chinese 
citizens participating in overseas hacking competi-
tions, suggesting that their successes were merely 
"imaginary."205 206 He argued that these hackers and 
their knowledge should remain in China given the 
strategic value of vulnerabilities.

uyghur-hacker-tianfu/. 
In the same month, at the 5th China Internet Security 
Conference (ISC) in September 2017, Zhou Hongyi in-
troduced the concept of "an Era of Big Security" (大安
全时代), emphasizing cybersecurity's integration into 
all security realms, online and offline. He highlighted 
the inevitability of cyber warfare, where vulnerabili-
ties serve as key weapons, and stressed the im-
portance of understanding network weaknesses for 
effective defense, suggesting vulnerabilities should 
be considered national strategic assets.207 
 
In 2018, Beijing banned Chinese research teams from 
attending exploit hacking competitions held outside 
of Chinese territory, such as Pwn2Own.208 This led to 
the creation of the Tianfu Cup competition, which 
held its inaugural edition in November 2018. The ab-
sence of Chinese hackers has since significantly al-
tered the landscape at Pwn2Own. For instance, 
throughout 2022 and 2023, there were no entrants 
willing to attempt to breach iPhone or Google Pixel 
devices, marking the end of a 15-year streak of target-
ing Apple products. The absence of hacking teams like 
Qihoo 360’s 360 Nirvan and 360 Alpha, Tencent’s 
Keen Security Lab, and Qi An Xin’s Pangu Team, which 
were notably active in targeting these devices, could 
explain this trend, rather than assuming these devices 
have become fully secure. This development illus-
trates that cybersecurity fragmentation and protec-
tionist vulnerability policies significantly undermine 
global cybersecurity.

Qihoo 360 collaborates with the MSS as a top-tier 
technical service unit (TSU) within the CNNVD.213 In 
2018, a threat actor known as Kryptonite Panda or 
APT40, which has operated as a contractor for the 
MSS since at least 2013, was found to have exploited 
a critical vulnerability a month before it was publicly 
disclosed. This vulnerability was initially discovered by 
Qihoo 360214, raising questions about the extent of 
the involvement of the Chinese cybersecurity giant's 
security research teams in state-sponsored offensive 
operations.

According to her findings, Qihoo 360 sold personal 
identifiable information of its antivirus customers to 
i-SOON, potentially enabling i-SOON to track 
individuals based on their online activities and 
provide their identities to government clients.215 
In 2015, Qihoo established the 360 Enterprise Security 
Group (ESG) as part of its efforts to gain a firm 
foothold in the enterprise cybersecurity sector.216 In 
2019, ESG broke off from Qihoo to form a separate 
company called Qi An Xin, taking with it key talent, 
expertise, and customer base (more on Qi An Xin 
later). Qihoo 360 then founded the ‘Government and 
Enterprise Security Group’ – which is now called 360 
Digital Security Group (DSG) - to reestablish its 
presence in the enterprise market. 360 DSG has 
consistently prioritized the provision of network 
security technologies, products, and services to a wide 
array of entities, including the Chinese military. On its 
website, 360 DSG claims to have established 
collaborations 
with 
90% 
of 
ministries 
and 
commissions, 72% of central enterprises, and 95% of 
large financial institutions.217 And to have partnered 
with millions of small and medium-sized Chinese 
enterprises to help enhance their network security.

Qihoo 360 CEO and founder Zhou Hongyi has 
highlighted the practical importance of testing 
security measures through real-world scenarios, 
asserting that “the essence of security is attack 
defense confrontation, and actual combat is the 
ultimate standard for testing security capabilities, 
which must withstand real attack defense tests.” 218  
This philosophy is mirrored in 360 DSG's leading 
position in the IT security enterprise-level training 
service market, boasting a 12.9% market share as per 
data from an International Data Corporation (IDC) 
China 2022 report.219 According to information 
provided on the 360 DSG website, Qihoo’s platform 
encompasses a comprehensive closed loop of 
enterprise safety training, from basic training of 
personnel to competition, from trial in virtual 
simulation environment to real cyber-attack and 
defense scenarios (figure 13). 220 
Over the years, 360 DSG’s scale has enabled it to 
cultivate specialized cybersecurity research centers 
and stand-up dedicated hacking teams. Determining 
the exact team sizes is challenging due to limited 
accessible information. 
However, 
according to 
insights from an anonymous source familiar with the 
subject, certain Qihoo teams, such as 360 Vulcan and 
360 Alpha, boast memberships exceeding 40 
individuals.

comprises a total of 19 groups, structured according 
to various departments and product lines, each 
tailored to specific areas of expertise and needs 
(Appendix A). Among them, only a few have received 
publicity for their outstanding work in vulnerability 
research and reporting. In no particular order, these 
include: 
• 360 Vulcan was founded by Zheng Wenbin. It 
serves as the offensive/defensive research team 
for the company’s flagship antivirus software, 
known as 360 Safeguard (Chinese version) and 
360 Total Security (international version). Vulcan 
specializes in fuzzing and reverse engineering to 
discover 
software 
security 
vulnerabilities.221 
Between 2017 and 2020, it has been the most 
significant 
China-based 
contributor 
to 
the 
Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) bug 
bounty program (section 7).  Some of its 
researchers have consistently ranked among 
Microsoft’s top 3 global security researcher 
rankings. In January 2021, several 360 Vulcan’s 
researchers left Qihoo and joined Zheng Wenbin in 
establishing Cyber Kunlun. 
• 360 Alpha provides security research support for 
the company’s mobile antivirus application, 
known as 360 Mobile Security.222 It conducts 
dedicated research in mobile security, with a 
particular emphasis on hunting and exploiting 
Android vulnerabilities.223 From 2017 to 2020, it 
was the second-most prolific China-based zero-
days reporting team to Google Android’s bug 
bounty program, second only to the 360 C0RE 
team. 
• 360 C0RE was established in 2015. It specializes in 
Android and Linux platforms with the goal of 
identifying zero-day vulnerabilities and creating 
proof-of-concept exploits.224 Known for actively 
reporting zero-days to Microsoft and Google 
Android's bug bounty programs from 2017 to 
2020 (section 7), the team appears to have halted

Qihoo's official list of teams on its website,225 360 
C0RE's own website, c0reteam.org, was taken 
offline in late 2019, as confirmed by records in the 
Internet Archive. 
• 360 IceSword was established within the 360 
Security Engineering Institute in 2016. As outlined 
on the team’s own website iceswordlab.com, the 
360 Security Engineering Institute provides core 
technical support, pioneers product research and 
development, and serves as a hub for engineering 
expertise and advanced technology exploration. 
The team’s research is focused on virtualization 
technology, cloud security, APT detection and 
defense, 
zero-day 
vulnerabilities, 
kernel 
protection, 
and 
mobile 
security.226 
Their 
achievements include the development of an 
automated vulnerability mining system.227 
• The 360 Security Response Center (360SRC) is 
housed within the 360 Information Security 
Department, which operates akin to a Security 
Operations Centre (SOC). 360SRC is responsible for 
monitoring and responding to security threats, 
vulnerabilities, and cyberattacks that may affect 
Qihoo 360's products, services, and the broader 
digital ecosystem.228 Much like Microsoft's MSRC, 
360SRC operates its own bug bounty program, 
encouraging the identification and responsible 
disclosure of security vulnerabilities.229 Between 
2017 and 2020, 360SRC has been one of Qihoo's 
most active contributors of zero-day reports to 
Google Android (section 7). 
• 360 Nirvan was established in 2015 and is also 
part 
of 
the 
360 
Information 
Security 
Department.230231 Its primary research focus is on 
Apple platforms, including the identification and 
exploitation of vulnerabilities at the operating 
system level. Between 2017 and 2020, 360 Nirvan 
was Qihoo’s most active zero-day contributor to 
Apple’s bug bounty program, trailing nationally

• 360 Unicorn conducts research on all things 
wireless and radio, including Radio-Frequency 
Identification (RFID), Near-field Communication 
(NFC), Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), Global 
Positioning System (GPS), autonomous vehicles, 
and SATCOM.232 At DEFCON in 2015, Unicorn 
researchers Lin Huang and Qing Yang showed how 
they were able to successfully spoof GPS 
information (creating a fake GPS signal, instead of 
just replaying a signal), and showing how a GPS-
controlled drone could be manipulated.233 In 2018, 
360 Unicorn made it into Tesla’s Security 
Researcher Hall of Fame.234 It is unclear if the team 
is currently operational, as it is not listed Qihoo's  
website.235 
This list represents only a portion of the numerous 
teams associated with Qihoo 360 (Appendix A), and 
many more are actively participating in various 
competitions and contributing to international bug 
bounty programs. As talented individuals attain a 
higher level of expertise in a specific subject area, they 
often transition to other companies or create their 
own cybersecurity startups.  
In the realm of vulnerability reporting, Qihoo 360 has 
consistently outperformed global peers. From the 
inception of the earliest bug bounty programs in the 
early 2010s through 2020, Qihoo 360’s research 
teams are reputed to have collectively reported close 
to 700 zero-days to Microsoft (more than 60% among 
all 
Chinese 
companies).236 
The 
company’s 
achievements have been publicly acknowledged by 
US companies. 2017 saw Qihoo 360 emerge as the

largest contributor to Google's Android Security 
Bulletin.237 In 2019, the company was named top 
enterprise vulnerability contributor to the MSRC.238 
On an individual researcher level, Qihoo 360 excelled 
with 10 out of 75 researchers earning a place on the 
MSRC most valuable researcher list in 2019, securing 
the first two spots.239 This number increased to 13 out 
of 75 in 2020. In 2021, the rankings for Google 
Chrome's vulnerability rewards program revealed 
that Qihoo 360 had secured the top position 
worldwide in terms of the number of researchers 
listed.240  
 
In 2020, Qihoo 360 started to significantly curtail its 
reporting of vulnerabilities to Apple, Google Android 
and Microsoft's bug bounty programs (section 7). This 
decrease raised concerns about the potential loss of a 
significant channel for vulnerability reporting within 
the global ecosystem. While there are multiple factors 
contributing to this decline, the Atlantic Council’s 
Dragon Tails report identified a noticeable correlation 
between the decrease in vulnerability reporting and 
the imposition of US sanctions.241 In May 2020, the US 
Commerce Department added Qihoo 360 to its black-
list citing its links to Chinese military-affiliated enter-
prises and its alleged role in aiding China's surveil-
lance of Uighur minorities in Xinjiang 242.

advertising, cloud computing, and AI. Particularly 
noteworthy is its mobile chat service WeChat, boast-
ing over 1.67 billion monthly active users, with most 
dedicating more than four hours daily to the plat-
form.244 WeChat is not only a messaging platform but 
also a social media, payment, and e-commerce app. It 
has become deeply integrated into the daily lives of 
many Chinese citizens. Tencent also operates QQ, a 
major Chinese social media platform, and Riot Games, 
a US company known for creating League of Legends, 
a multiplayer online battle arena game, which at-
tracts an average of over 132 million players 
monthly.245 The company's surging revenue, stock 
price, and vast user base has made Tencent one of the 
most valuable company globally.246 Given its pivotal 
role in providing essential messaging and networking 
services, Tencent is of strategic importance to the Chi-
nese government. 
 
Tencent boasts various vulnerability research teams 
that have made significant contributions by identify-
ing and reporting major vulnerabilities to prominent 
Western companies, including Apple, Google, and Mi-
crosoft. All these teams operate within the Tencent 
United Security Laboratory, established in Shenzhen 
in 2016, which is the research division of Tencent Se-
curity.247 The Joint Laboratory’s focus spans 5G, IoT, 
autonomous vehicles, AI, mobile, cloud, and satellite 
security, as well as antivirus and anti-ransomware so-
lutions. The exact number of currently active labs is 
unknown, but there are likely between 7 and 10. On 
its website, Tencent features two tabs (Tencent Secu-
rity and Security Lab),248 each leading to a group of 7 
labs. However, only 4 labs are common across both 
pages (Appendix B).

Among the labs listed, only a few are publicly known 
for their outstanding work in vulnerability research 
and reporting. In no particular order, these include: 
• The Xuanwu Lab, Tencent's first security research 
laboratory, was founded in 2014.249 The lab fo-
cuses on vulnerability research and web applica-
tion security, especially on mobile platforms.250 
Between 2017 and 2020, the Xuanwu Lab has 
been Tencent’s most active contributor of zero-
day reports to Microsoft and Apple (section 7). 
 
• The Tianma Lab specializes on satellite network se-
curity and their application for critical infrastruc-
ture.251 Specifically, it focuses on identifying high-
risk vulnerabilities and ensuring the security of 
critical satellite communication, telephony, digital 
radio, and television. Other research areas include 
IoT devices and networked control systems. In 
2022252 and 2023253, the Tianma Lab received 
awards for the most valuable vulnerability and 
contributions by individual researchers to the 
China National Vulnerability Database (CNVD).

• The Keen Security Lab was acquired by Tencent af-
ter their success at Pwn2Own in 2014. The lab spe-
cializes in the network security of autonomous ve-
hicles, including models produced by major indus-
try players like Mercedes-Benz, Tesla, Toyota,256 
and BMW. 257 258 Its research also encompasses IoT 
device hacking, mobile security, and browser hack-
ing. In 2016 and 2017, the Keen Lab secured a spot 
in the Tesla Security Researcher Hall of Fame, and 
even garnered recognition by Elon Musk him-
self.259 In 2018, they earned the prestigious "BMW 
Group Digital and IT R&D Technology Award," ex-
panding their partnership with BMW.260 Their ex-
tensive collaboration extended to an eight-month 
code audit with Mercedes-Benz, resulting in the 
release of the "Mercedes-Benz Automobile Infor-
mation Security Research Review Report" in May 
2021.261 This report unveiled several major vulner-
abilities, four of which could be exploited for re-
mote code execution. The report also solidified 
Keen’s commitment to future collaboration with 
BMW.   
 
Until at least 2020, Tencent maintained its position as 
the second-largest Chinese contributor of zero-day 
vulnerabilities to US-based bug bounty programs, 
ranking only behind Qihoo 360. However, like Qihoo 
360, Tencent subsequently reduced its vulnerability 
disclosures to Google and Microsoft.262

The history of Qi An Xin’s Pangu team goes back to 
2014, when Pwnzen Infotech was established in 
Shanghai. Pwnzen Infotech (犇众信息) is a security re-
search institution focusing on operating system secu-
rity, automated analysis, vulnerability mining, and at-
tack and defense technologies.263  
 
Pwnzen hosts the Pangu Team (盘古越狱团队), which 
was also established in 2014.264 It is comprised of re-
searchers dedicated to conducting offensive and de-
fensive research for mobile systems and applications. 
The Pangu Team gained international fame for 
launching numerous successful jailbreak tools for Ap-
ple iOS, and it was purportedly the first team to ac-
complish comprehensive jailbreaks for iOS 8265 and 
iOS 9,266 resulting in tens of millions of downloads 
globally. Over time, the group's focus transitioned 
from a jailbreaking team to a professional mobile se-
curity research team. It has established the Pangu Lab, 
which conducts extensive security research on the se-
curity architecture of mobile devices hardware, sys-
tems, applications, and connectivity. Since 2015, the 
Pangu Team has also been hosting its own mobile se-
curity conference, called MOSEC in Shanghai. While

and practitioners in the field.267 
 
Unlike other security research teams, the Pangu Team 
provides a full list of its members' identities and bios 
on its website, accompanied by cartoonish profile pic-
tures. However, their immediate affiliation is less evi-
dent. In 2021, the Pangu Lab officially merged with Qi 
An Xin (奇安信网神信息技术（北京）股份有限公司), 
forming Qi An Pangu Technology.268 Qi An Pangu has 
since then been able to leverage Qi An Xin’s vulnera-
bility attack and defense research and has closely in-
tegrated with its mobile big data platform. 269 
 
Qi An Pangu is one of only a handful of Chinese enti-
ties that have publicly attributed US cyber espionage 
activities. In 2022, the Pangu Lab reported that it dis-
covered activities of the Equation Group – believed to 
be a mix of the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA)’s 
Tailored Access Operation unit and the Central Intelli-
gence Agency (CIA)’s Information Operations Center – 
conducted against Chinese networks.270 Pangu dis-
covered a malware it named Bvp47 that was deployed 
within the domestic IT systems of a key Chinese de-
partment in 2013 and 2015. The malware was used to 
monitor and track key institutions in 45 countries over 
a 10-year campaign.271 This revelation adds to the at-
tribution statements made by Qihoo 360 in 2020 and 
2022, which accused the CIA272 and the NSA273 of con-
ducting malicious cyber operations against China’s 
leading companies, governments, research institutes, 
and critical infrastructure over the past decade. 
 
In 2023, Pangu Lab researchers claimed to have iden-
tified six members of a hacktivist group known as 
"Against The West." Among them is Tillie Kottmann, a

Qi An Pangu’s mother company, Qi An Xin, is a leader 
in China’s cybersecurity industry. Established in 2015, 
it was originally an entity housed within Qihoo 360 
under the name of 360 ESG until the split in 2019.  It 
is now partly owned by Chinese state-owned enter-
prise, China Electronics Corporation (中国电子信息产
业集团有限公司). In 2020, CEC was labeled by the 
Trump administration as a ‘Communist Chinese mili-
tary company’.275 Allegedly, Qi An Xin kept all its gov-
ernment contracts after splitting from Qihoo 360. On 
its own LinkedIn profile, the company claims that its 
products and services have been adopted by over 90% 
of China’s central government departments, central 
government-led enterprises, and large banks.276 Qi An 
Xin has been entrusted by the Chinese government 
with managing cybersecurity during high-profile 
events, such as the 70th anniversary of the CCP's rule 
and the Beijing Winter Games.277 The Beijing city gov-
ernment recognized Qi An Xin as one of the 20 "invis-
ible champions," a designation reserved for compa-
nies critical to China's national strategy. According to 
Dakota Cary, “as far as companies are concerned, their 
talent is undoubtedly in the top 10 globally. When 
there is an issue at the provincial level or even at the 
central level, when the government needs a response 
team, it seems that Qi An Xin is known.”278 
 
Qi An Xin is deeply connected with Chinese intelli-
gence and military services, and it operates its own 
Cybersecurity MCF Innovation Center. Its staff in-
cludes 1,300 CCP members, which amounts to 14% of 
its entire staff.279 More than 40% of its main revenue

agencies, with additional clients from the military and 
defense industry.280  
 
As outlined in the 2023 report “Gaming Public Opin-
ion” by Albert Zhan of the Australian Strategic Policy 
Institute (ASPI), Qi An Xin has direct and indirect work-
ing relationships with the MPS and the MSS. 281 These 
collaborations include the establishment of national 
cybersecurity standards and involvement in influence 
operations.282 Zhan makes a clear connection be-
tween Qi An Xin and the company’s support for MPS 
through the participation in state-sponsored influ-
ence operations in Southeast Asia and various other 
countries.283 Additionally, Qi An Xin established the 
Cyber Security Penetration Testing Centre in partner-
ship with the China Information Technical Security 
Evaluation Center (CNITSEC). CNITSEC is housed 
within the 13th Bureau of the MSS, which hosts a sig-
nificant portion of the agency’s technical cyber exper-
tise.284 
 
Qi An Xin also supports government-contracted com-
panies engaged in espionage activities. Winnona 
Bernsen, in her examination of the i-SOON leaks, re-
vealed that Qi An Xin appeared to play a pivotal role 
as i-SOON's primary contractor, competitor, and po-
tential investor. Internal company chat logs suggest 
that i-SOON has relied on investment funds from Qi 
An Xin to pay its departments and has explored the 
possibility of collaborating with the company to pro-
vide training to other clients.285 
 
Finally, Qi An Xin plays a significant role in vulnerabil-
ity research. It is recognized as a top-tier technical 
support unit (TSU) 286 and operates its own vulnera-
bility database, known as the Bu Tian Vulnerability 
Database. This database serves as a platform for civil-
ian hackers to collaborate on identifying and address-
ing software vulnerabilities. This data then finds its 
way to the MSS. In 2021287, 2022288, and 2023289 the 
Bu Tian platform was recognized by the CNVD for its 
valuable contributions to vulnerability reporting.

The Tianfu Cup 
(2018-2023) 
This section traces the history and performance of 
Chinese hacking teams that participated at the 
Tianfu Cup (2018-2023). It analyzes the competing 
teams, their affiliations with corporate entities, and 
their connections to China’s cyber intelligence 
activities. Finally, it investigates the targets and 
economic incentives of the competition, and how 
these align with China’s broader strategic interests.  
 
290 Provincial Employment Bureau, “四川省第四届‘天府杯’创业大赛方案策划
项目比选公告,” Department of Human Resources and Social Security of Si-
chuan Province, August 4, 2023, 
http://rst.sc.gov.cn/rst/gsgg/2023/8/4/f9ed3cddd8e54d62ad027daae18d95
da.shtml. 
The Tianfu Cup (天府杯) is China's foremost exploit 
hacking competition. It functions similarly to 
Pwn2Own, where participants earn rewards for 
finding vulnerabilities in widely used soft- and 
hardware products. Based in Chengdu, Sichuan 
province, the Tianfu Cup commenced in November 
2018 and runs annually. Due to the COVID-19 
pandemic, it was cancelled in 2022, but recommenced 
in 2023.290 For the 2023 iteration, 17 companies were 
listed as the main organizers. These included Huawei, 
Qihoo 360, Cyber Kunlun, Qi An Xin, Topsec, NSFOCUS, 
and Sangfor. Cyber Kunlun and Qi An Xin were the 
only two companies that were designated co-
organizers of the event.  
Similar to Pwn2Own, participants in the Tianfu Cup 
can win significant financial rewards and national 
recognition by showcase their technical skills. 
Naturally, participants also exchange knowledge, 
learn from each other, and network.  
In 2018, the total prize pool was 1 million USD. In 
2019, it shrank to 500.000 USD.  In 2020, it was back 
up at 1,2 million USD, and in 2021 it grew to 1,9 
million USD. In that year, the top three teams earned 
654.500 USD, 522.500 USD and 392.500 USD 
respectively.291 In 2023, the total prize pool was 1,4 
million USD.292 Pwn2Own’s prize pool similarly hovers 
between 1-2 million USD.  
Between 2018 and 2021, the focus of the Tianfu Cup 
primarily centered on Western software products. In 
2023, the Cup began to include a growing number of 
Chinese products as well. This report could not 
confirm whether the Tianfu Cup organizers asked 
Western companies for permission to utilize their 
products as targets for the competition or have 
engaged in any other forms of collaboration.

Key Points 
 
• The Tianfu Cup mostly attracts professionals, 
with Western targets being the prime focus. 
 
• The Tianfu Cup has increasingly become inter-
twined with state-sponsored operations, with 
exploits showcased by participants highly likely 
funneled to the MSS.  
 
• Initially, Tencent and Qihoo dominated the com-
petition, mirroring dynamics seen at Pwn2Own. 
 
• From 2020 onward, a new wave of winners 
emerged, including teams affiliated with Cyber 
Kunlun and the Ant Group. These are prolific 
suppliers of zero-day vulnerabilities to the MSS. 
 
• Ant Group boasts 9 vulnerability research labor-
atories, with ambiguity surrounding their organ-
izational structure. 
 
• Cyber Kunlun is strongly linked to Qihoo 360. It 
operates through two divisions: the Kunlun Lab 
and the Kunlun Advanced Offensive and Defen-
sive Team. 
• Tianfu Cup participants have voiced grievances 
about the need to distribute the prize money 
across their organization. 
 
• The 2023 Tianfu Cup marked a notable shift 
away from Western targets, redirecting its focus 
to Chinese products and systems.

The first edition of the Tianfu Cup starred a mix of es-
tablished Chinese hacking teams and newcomers. Qi-
hoo 360 participated with three teams: 360 Security, 
360 Vulcan and 360 Nirvan. The Ant Group, previously 
known as Ant Financial, participated with two teams: 
oyear and lyear.293 Others included, the Antui Team 
(Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Computing 
Technology-Tencent); the Security Warriors team 
(Guangzhou University Fangban-Tencent); and three 
360 Vulcan members participated individually: Zhao 
Qixun, Tang Tianwen, and Jia Zhenjie. 294 295 The first 
prize was won by 360 Security, which successfully ex-
ploited zero-days vulnerabilities against Apple Safari, 
iPhoneX, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Microsoft 
Office, and Oracle’s Virtual Box, earning the team a 
total of 62.000 USD.296 The 2nd and 3rd place were won 
by the Atuin team and the Security Warriors respec-
tively. Zhao Qixun won the title of "Best Individual" 
and was awarded the highest single reward of 
200.000 USD for demonstrating an exploit chain to 
breach the iPhone. 297 298 The outcome of the inaugu-

ral event predominantly mirrored the patterns ob-
served at Pwn2Own, in which teams affiliated with 
Qihoo 360 and Tencent secured victories across the 
board.  
 
Two teams, consisting of collaboration efforts be-
tween industry and universities, secured the 2nd and 
3rd spots. One team was a collaboration effort be-
tween the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of 
Computing Technology (ICT CAS) and Tencent Atuin. 
Tencent Atuin is likely an alias for the Tencent 
Xuanwu Lab.299 The team’s “Atuin” name almost cer-
tainly refers to a software platform by the same name 
which was created by Tencent’s Xuanwu Lab and ICT 
CAS’ Big Data Security Group.300  The Atuin software 
platform collects information on vulnerabilities and 
supply chain issues through an automated software 
analysis. The second team comprised members from 
the Guangzhou University Fangban (GUF) and the 
Tencent Security Warriors team, which is likely associ-
ated with the Tencent Keen Security Lab. 301  
 
Industry-university collaborations underscore a grow-
ing trend in where students from top-ranking Chinese 
universities, with close ties to the state, increasingly 
engage in collaborative vulnerability research with 
leading Chinese tech companies, who have a strong 
emphasis on advancing automated vulnerability min-
ing technologies. While instances of industry-univer-
sity collaborations are prevalent in China, their joint 
participation in popular exploit hacking competition 
has so far been a rather rare occurrence.  
 
However, the real legacy of the inaugural Tianfu Cup 
is how quickly the event was associated with state-
sponsored cyber operations. In August 2019, Google 
published an analysis detailing a hacking effort aimed 
at “exploiting iPhones en masse.”302

Google researchers identified five distinct exploit 
chains, including an exploit called “Chaos,” which 
Zhao Qixun demonstrated during the 2018 Tianfu 
Cup. Subsequently, in September of the same year, 
Apple disclosed that the Chaos exploit had been used 
in a surveillance and hacking campaign targeting Uy-
ghur Muslims, starting shortly after Qixun's demon-
stration at the Tianfu Cup and lasting until Apple is-
sued a patch in January 2019.303  Several Western me-
dia outlets, such as Tech Crunch, linked these mali-
cious operations to the Chinese government.304 This 
instance likely highlights that vulnerabilities submit-
ted to the Tianfu Cup are shared with Chinese govern-
ment agencies.  
 
The 2019 Tianfu Cup edition was won by Qihoo 360’s 
360 Vulcan team, which received a total of 382.500 
USD.305 The second place was secured by ddd from 
Tencent’s Xuanwu Lab, who earned a total of 83.750 
USD for exploits targeting Edge, Chrome, Adobe 
Reader, and D-Link routers. The third place went to the 
Ant Group’s StackLeader team for a total of 38.750 
USD. 360 Vulcan’s Xiao Wei received the highest re-
ward of 200.000 USD for a working exploit against the 
VMware vSphere ESXi product that allowed them to 
escape from the guest virtual machine to the host306.

In the 2020 contest, Qihoo 360’s 360 ESG 
Vulnerability Research Institute team clinched the top 
award of 744.500 USD, accounting for nearly two-
thirds of the total jackpot of 1.2 million USD. The team 
also received the distinguished “Best Product Crack 
Award.”307 360 ESG managed to breach an array of 
high-profile targets, including Google Chrome, 
Firefox, VMware ESXi, Ubuntu, Samsung Galaxy S20, 
Windows 10, iPhone 11 Pro, Adobe PDF Reader, and 
TP-Link WDR7660. The second and third positions 
were secured by the Ant Group’s Ant Financial 
Lightyear Security Lab and the Pangu Team.308 
Teams from Tencent (Qihoo 360’s main competitor at 
Pwn2Own) did not take part in the 2020 Tianfu Cup 
edition. The reason for Tencent's decision to step back 
is unclear. Sources familiar with the subject suggest 
that Tencent discouraged its employees from 
participating. Tencent is also absent as a significant 
sponsor supporting the Tianfu Cup. On the other 
hand, the enduring success of Qihoo’s 360 teams is a 
testament to the company's sustained leadership, 
securing three consecutive triumphs at the Tianfu 
Cup.

team.309 Cyber Kunlun targeted a wide spectrum of 
platforms, including Google Chrome, Adobe Reader, 
VMware ESXi and Workstation, iPhone 13 Pro, Safari 
on macOS, and Windows 10.310 Cyber Kunlun was 
followed by the Pangu Team and by the Youth 
Training Team of Vulnerability Research Institute. The 
Pangu Team successfully executed a remote jailbreak 
of the iPhone 13 Pro equipped with iOS 15, which 
could be triggered with a single click on a 
meticulously crafted link. This performance earned 
the Pangu Team the highest single reward in the 
competition, 
amounting 
to 
300.000 
USD.311 
Additional high-value findings surfaced in the 2021 
competition included new exploits targeting Android 
phone models from multiple manufacturers.  
The absence of Qihoo 360’s renowned teams from the 
competition marked a new development, potentially 
attributable to major internal restructuring. Many 
members of Qihoo 360's Vulcan team left the 
company in 2021 to form Cyber Kunlun, resulting in a 
considerable loss of essential expertise. 
In the Tianfu Cup 2023, the highest award of 340.000 
USD was secured by the Ant Group’s Ant Financial 
Lightyear Security Lab for hacking VMware ESXI, 
Chrome browser, Adobe, Windows 11 and the Chi-
nese-made office product WPS.312 CyAgent and Sang-
for’s k team placed second and third, winning 100.000 
USD and 30.000 USD respectively.313 The Qihoo 360 
teams were once again absent from the competition. 
Over the years, a parallel development has emerged 
between the Tianfu Cup and Chinese APTs when it 
comes to target preferences. The Tianfu Cup has 
steadily broadened its target spectrum to include vir-
tualization solutions like VMware, Parallels, and 
qemu, as well as routers and other network devices.

Concurrently, Chinese APTs have shown increased ac-
tivity in targeting the same software and devices, par-
ticularly since 2021. According to Recorded Future’s 
Insikt Group, over 85% of the known zero-day vulner-
abilities exploited by Chinese state-sponsored groups 
since early 2021 were found in internet-facing appli-
ances such as email servers, SSL VPN products, fire-
walls, and routers.314 In a separate report published in 
2023, Mandiant researchers detailed how Chinese 
threat actors have targeted Fortinet and VMware se-
curity products to establish persistence on victim net-

In 2018, Zhao Qixun’s Chaos exploit serves as the 
prime example of the Tianfu Cup's likely relationship 
with Chinese state agencies. The 2021 Tianfu Cup, 
coupled with the emergence of the i-SOON leaks, has 
further reinforced this association.  
 
Following the 2021 Tianfu Cup, a group of China-fo-
cused analysts known as the "Natto Team" noticed 
that, while vulnerabilities in VMware products were 
showcased by Chinese researchers at the October 
2021 Tianfu Cup, VMware only released patches for 
these vulnerabilities in February 2022, nearly four 
months later.316 Upon releasing the patches, VMware 
affirmed in a Q&A document that these vulnerabili-
ties “were reported to the Chinese government by the 
researchers that discovered them, in accordance with 
their laws.” The company later retracted this state-
ment.317  
 
Similarly, the Microsoft Digital Defense Report 2022 
revealed that the CVE-2021-42321 vulnerability in Mi-
crosoft Exchange was exploited in the wild only three 
days after it was showcased at the Tianfu Cup 2021. 
This suggests that threat actors may have obtained 
early access to it, enabling nearly simultaneous ex-
ploitation.318

The zero-days demonstrated at the Tianfu Cup some-
times exceeded typical competition standards. Ac-
cording to cybersecurity analyst JD Work, the practical 
significance of the exploit collections utilized in the 
2021 Tianfu Cup resembles the high-value capabili-
ties utilized in critical counter-terrorism operations by 
a Western government.319  
 
The 2024 i-SOON leaks further substantiate the sus-
picions that zero-days submitted to the Tianfu Cup 
are indeed shared with Chinese government agencies. 
Internal I-SOON discussions indicate that exploits 
from the Tianfu Cup 2021 were transmitted to the 
"public security bureau" in Jiangsu (figure 16), 
strongly suggesting the involvement of the Ministry 
of Public Security (MPS).320 The I-SOON chatlogs spe-
cifically note that “the Ministry will give it to Jiangsu 
every year, and it will not be given to all provinces. It 
is estimated that they are all given to strong prov-
inces.”321

It is likely that the reference to the MPS is referring to 
the Ministry of State Security (MSS). During Intrusion 
Truth’s investigation into APT40 the group discovered 
a photo on QQ that depicted one of its members 
wearing a MSS uniform.322 On another Chinese social 
media platform, the same individual openly discussed 
his connection with China's MPS, suggesting its utili-
zation as a disguise for the MSS. Furthermore, Jiangsu 
province is known to host an MSS branch that is fo-
cused on intellectual property theft online (Turbine 
Panda or APT26). In 2022, former FBI cyber expert and 
Crowdstrike China analyst Adam Kozy, testified be-
fore the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review 
Commission that MSS officers frequently employ the 
MPS as a cover, affirming that “the MSS’s close ties to 
the MPS would become increasingly beneficial in the 
early 2000s, affording both convenient cover for MSS 
offices, which were often co-located with MPS of-
fices.” He specifically cited the case of the Jiangsu 
branch of the MSS (APT26) operating out of MPS of-
fice buildings in Jiangsu (figure 17).323

According to Harfang’s analysis of the i-SOON leak, 
the chat logs suggest an institutional process in which 
vulnerabilities discovered for the Tianfu Cup are col-
lected by the MPS (or MSS), distributed to provinces 
for cyber operations, and eventually shared with con-
tractors. This likely mirrors the vulnerability reporting 
process of the MSS-run Chinese National Vulnerabil-
ity Database (CNNVD).324  
For the most part, the Tianfu Cup contestants are 
searching for vulnerabilities in Western products. At 
the 2021 Tianfu Cup, Chinese products, such as Synol-
ogy’s DS220j NAS, Xiaomi’s Mi 11 smartphone, and an 
undisclosed Chinese electric vehicle, remained un-
touched by participants due to the relatively low 
bounties (table 4). As a result, none of the participants 
even attempted to find vulnerabilities in these prod-
ucts.325

uct line-up shifted away from mostly from Western

These efforts align with a broader objective. In De-
cember 2022, the Chinese government unveiled its 
Strategic Plan for Expanding Domestic Demand 
2022–2035, aimed at stimulating significant "infor-
mation innovation" (信创). Writing for The China Pro-
ject, Barry van Wyk, explains that the government’s 
plan of “information innovation” was introduced back 
in 2006. It seeks for China to attain self-sufficiency in 
advanced technologies and lessen its reliance on for-
eign suppliers.329 In particular, it emphasizes the full 
domestication of China’s IT infrastructure and the 
substitution of core components, such as semicon-
ductors, software, and databases.  
 
Overall, the information innovation plan focuses on 
four key areas: IT infrastructure, foundational soft-
ware, application software, and information security. 
It progresses through three stages: Initial implemen-
tation in state institutions, expansion into key indus-
tries, and eventual adoption by consumer markets.330 
According to the Wall Street Journal, as recently as six 
years ago, Chinese government tenders predomi-
nantly sought semiconductors and software products 
from Western companies. By 2023, most government 
tenders were seeking Chinese tech products in-
stead.331 
 
While partly influenced by the heightened Western 
scrutiny of Huawei in recent years, there are addi-
tional factors motivating the information innovation 
plan. First, the Chinese government inherently dis-
trusts U.S. hardware and software products, which 
was particularly exemplified by the Juniper hack and 
the enduring US government discussions on weaken-
ing encryption and inserting backdoors in U.S. tech-
nology products.332 In December 2015, Juniper Net-
works disclosed the presence unauthorized backdoors 
in its firewalls – potentially allowing decryption of 
protected traffic – with suspicions pointing towards 
NSA involvement.333 Second, because of the Snowden 
Leaks in 2013, Beijing emphasized data sovereignty, 
meaning keep data in-country and maintain control

over it. Among other items, Snowden’s disclosure of 
the PRISM program revealed extensive US surveil-
lance efforts to collect electronic communication data 
from internet services and technology companies 
globally. 
 
Featuring Chinese products in hacking competitions, 
such as the Tianfu Cup, coupled with a large prize pool 
might encourage the formation of teams that special-
ize in securing Chinese products. Heightened scrutiny 
from talented research teams might in turn likely 
strengthen China’s defensive capabilities and en-
hance the reputation of its cybersecurity and software 
products globally.  
 
Despite the Tianfu Cup’s significant prize pool, partic-
ipants have nonetheless voiced grievances, because 
internal team arrangements are structured in such a 
way that the prize money is distributed not only 
among the participating team members, but also 
across their organization, including their superiors. 
One Chinese participant complained online that “do-
mestic security researchers are rising, but it can also 
be seen that there are also many teams who give up 
the competition, because according to this year's bo-
nus distribution rules, teams that break the same pro-
ject will share the bonus equally. In other words, the 
more people play the project, the less you get. If you 
use multiple sets of exploits to play the same project, 
you will lose more.”334 This setup thus likely dimin-
ishes some of the underlying motivation to pursue 
substantial rewards for the most challenging tar-
gets.335 A source, which was granted anonymity for 
this report, further elaborated that, because  compa-
nies like Qihoo 360 have numerous teams with siza-
ble memberships, they are forced to consolidate re-
searchers into a handful of  teams that compete in the 
challenges. This often results in the exclusion of many 
talented researchers, which in turn results in dimin-
ished income for the excluded individuals and a lack 
of social recognition.

At the same time, there are not many other alterna-
tives Chinese hackers can turn to. As highlighted by 
cybersecurity expert Adam Segal, the exclusion of Chi-
nese researchers from international competitions has 
restricted alternative income sources for China's lead-
ing hackers.336 The changed circumstances and lower 
economic opportunities for the current generation of 
hackers compels them to form closer associations 
with government agencies, to establish their own 
startup or institutions in China, and/or or join estab-
lished companies. Some of the most prominent 
among these companies include the very ones spon-
soring the Tianfu Cup. These include 360 Security, Qi 
An Xin, Cyber Kunlun, Huawei, Baidu, Alibaba, THU, 
the CAS Institute of Information Engineering, Na-
tional Industrial Information Security Development 
Research Center, NSFOCUS Technology, Tianrong Xin, 
VenusTech, Topsec, and Yongxin Zhicheng. Most of 
these companies are top-tier zero-day suppliers to the 
MSS and contribute to China’s MCF efforts in cyber-
space. 337 
 
Some of the Chinese cybersecurity companies that 
sponsor the Tianfu Cup have been associated with 
state-sponsored cyber operations in the past.  Topsec 
has provided cybersecurity services and training for 
the Chinese military for several years. The company 
has been implicated in several cyber-espionage cam-
paigns, with the most notable incident being the 2015 
hack of US insurance giant Anthem. The breach led to 
the exfiltration of personal identifiable information of 
nearly 78.8 million individuals.338 Additionally, 
Huawei's affiliation with APT3, an MSS-affiliated Chi-
nese espionage group339, contributed to the skepti-
cism and regulatory measures imposed by some 
countries globally to limit or exclude Huawei from 
critical infrastructure projects.

341 “Ant Group,” PitchBook (blog), https://pitchbook.com/profiles/com-
pany/99609-31. 
The Ant Group (蚂蚁集团)was formerly known as the 
Zhejiang Alibaba E-Commerce Company. The group 
was founded by Alibaba Group Holding to in the 
context of the rollout of Alipay in 2004 to address the 
trust issues in China’s emerging online shopping 
ecosystem.340 In 2011, the company spun off from 
Alibaba. Headquartered in Hangzhou, Zhejiang 
province, Ant Group has evolved into a technology 
giant, counting 25.000 employees and a reported 
revenue of about 11 billion USD in early 2024.  341 
With a user base surpassing 1.3 billion, Ant Group's 
digital payments platform, Alipay, along with 
Tencent's WeChat Pay, command a virtual duopoly in 
China's mobile payments landscape. This dominance 
has propelled Ant Group to become the largest online 
provider of microfinance services in China, surpassing 
traditional financial institutions in the total amount 
of credit issued through its platform.342  
Due to its substantial size, the Ant Group – like Ten-
cent – faced tensions with the Chinese government. 
In late 2020, the company’s founder Jack Ma resisted 
sharing customer credit data with government agen-
cies and he even publicly criticized President Xi's cam-
paign to strengthen financial oversight.343 As a result, 
in early 2023, Ant Group announced that Jack Ma 
would cede control over the company.344 Later that 
year, Beijing imposed fines exceeding 1 billion USD on 
both the Ant Group and Tencent.345 This marked the 
end of Beijing’s crackdown of the Chinese tech sector 
which started in late 2020. During the 2022 National 
Cyber Security Publicity Week in Hefei, Anhui Prov-
ince, the Ant Group unveiled nine major security la-

Tianqian labs prioritize “cutting-edge technology” se-
curity research to elevate security standards. The 
Tianshu and Tianmeng labs focus on cybercrime re-
search and industry collaboration. More detailed in-
formation about the laboratories is not publicly avail-
able. It is unclear whether the Ant Financial Security 
Lightyear Laboratory, a key participant in events like 
the Tianfu Cup and international bug bounty pro-
grams, is part of these nine laboratories or whether it 
is the umbrella unit that houses all nine laboratories. 
The Ant Financial Security Lightyear Laboratory (蚂蚁
金服光年实验室) was established in 2016 as part of 
the Ant Group.347 In a 2022 post on Maimai, which is 
often likened to the Chinese equivalent of LinkedIn, 
the Ant Group outlined that the Lightyear Laboratory 
focuses 
on 
automated 
vulnerability 
discovery, 
browser security, virtualization, and database secu-
rity. The Laboratory secured 3rd, 2nd, and 1st place in 
the Tianfu Cup in 2019, 2020, and 2023 respectively. 
It also emerged as the top zero-day vulnerabilities re-
porting Chinese company to Apple from 2021 to Jan-
uary 2022. The Ant Group is a top-tier technical sup-
port unit (TSU) for the MSS-run CNNVD. In 2023, the 
CNVD recognized the lab for its valuable contribu-
tions to vulnerability reporting.348 
Established in Beijing in 2021, Cyber Kunlun (北京赛
博昆仑科技有限公司) provides cyber security solu-
tions and IT services to a wide range of clients, includ-
ing unspecified Chinese government institutions. The 
company specializes in the protection against zero-
day attacks and conducts offensive and defensive 
drills seeking to simulate APT behavior.349 Kunlun’s 
history is deeply intertwined with Qihoo 360 and the 
360 Vulcan team. The founder of Cyber Kunlun - 
Wenbin Zheng -is also the founder of 360 Vulcan and 
served as Qihoo 360’s chief technology officer. Simi-

larly, Cyber Kunlun’s CTO - Xuebin Chen - was a direc-
tor in Qihoo 360's Vulnerability Research Institute. Ac-
cording to the US-based research firm Margin Re-

mother company Qihoo 360 and has partnered with 
the Pangu Lab to integrate expertise in vulnerability 
mining, protection, advanced threat detection, and 
response for developing new security products and 
services.350 
 
Although the exact size of its workforce is not dis-
closed publicly, Cyber Kunlun operates through two 
divisions: the Kunlun Lab and the Kunlun Advanced 
Offensive and Defensive Team. According to its web-
site, Cyber Kunlun translates research on zero-day 
vulnerabilities into security solutions, aiding enter-
prises in preemptively detecting and defending 
against potential attacks. 351  Their main areas of fo-
cus include desktop and mobile security, cloud com-
puting, virtualization security, and IoT device secu-
rity.352 The senior team members, instead, excel in of-
fensive and defensive security research and have par-
ticipated in various national and enterprise-level at-
tack-defense exercises across industries like energy, 
banking, and media. Their primary focuses encom-
pass enterprise security, host security, and application 
security.353 Since its establishment, the Kunlun Lab 
has reported numerous vulnerabilities in products 
such as Windows, iOS, Google, VMware, as well as 
open-source software.354 Between 2021 and 2023, 
the lab stood out as China’s most prolific zero-day re-
porter to Microsoft’s bug bounty program (section 7). 
Kunlun Lab entered the Tianfu Cup in 2021, securing 
the first position. In 2021, Sohu.com acknowledged 
Cyber Kunlun and the Pangu Team from Qi An Xin as 
China’s most popular security teams.355 While there is 
no publicly available information that links Cyber 
Kunlun to any malicious cyber campaigns, the com-
pany is a technical support unit (TSU) for the MSS-run

Bug Bounties 
This section centers on an analysis of the 
contributions of Chinese research teams to the bug 
bounty programs of Android (Google), Microsoft, and 
Apple between 2017-2023. It also examines Chinese 
bug bounty programs, their framework, and their 
comparative monetary incentives when juxtaposed 
with other international initiatives.  
 
357 TechTarget Contributor, “Bug Bounty Program,” WhatIs? (blog), n.d., 
https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/bug-bounty-program. 
Bug bounty programs are similar to hacking 
competitions. In hacking competitions, researchers 
showcase exploits to prove their practicability and 
speed in a real-world setting. Bug bounty programs 
are online crowdsourcing initiatives that reward 
individuals for finding and reporting software bugs 
and vulnerabilities. These reports must contain 
enough detail for the company to reproduce the 
issue.357 The analysis of the contributions of Chinese 
teams to the bug bounty programs of Android 
(Google), Microsoft, and Apple can be divided into two 
distinct periods: 2017-2020 and 2021-2023.  
 
In 2017, the Chinese teams established themselves 
and the three bug bounty programs sufficiently 
matured. In 2020, the US sanctioned Qihoo 360, 
which – at the time – was a major contributor to the 
three bug bounty programs. The sanctions led to a 
significant reduction in the vulnerability reporting 
from Qihoo teams to US companies.358 Tencent 
decreased its contributions to the three bug bounty 
programs 
around 
the 
same 
period. 
The 
announcement of the RMSV laws in 2020, which 
mandates that researchers submit zero-days to state 
authorities first, raised concerns about the potential 
disappearance 
of 
a 
significant 
channel 
for 
vulnerability reporting within the global ecosystem. 
An overview of the combined submissions from 
Chinese research teams in the three bug bounty 
programs from 2017 to 2023 (figure 18) shows that 
China contributed 27% of all vulnerabilities, while the 
rest of the world accounted for 59%. 14% of 
submissions were anonymous.

Key Points 
 
• From 2017 to 2023, China accounted for 27% 
of all vulnerabilities reported to the bug 
bounty programs of Apple, Google Android, 
and Microsoft, contrasting with the rest of 
the world at 59%. 
 
• From 2017 to 2020, Qihoo 360 and Tencent 
dominated submissions for Microsoft, 
Google Android, and Apple, mirroring perfor-
mance observed at Pwn2Own and the Tianfu 
Cup. 
 
• From 2021 to 2023, the Kunlun Lab, the 
Oppo Amber Security Lab and the Ant 
Lightyear Security Lab became primary con-
tributors for Microsoft, Google Android, and 
Apple respectively. 
 
• Teams affiliated with Qihoo 360 and Tencent 
notably reduced their contributions from 
2021 to 2023, partly due to US sanctions on 
Qihoo 360 and talent transitions among 
companies. 
 
• The success of Chinese teams is frequently 
attributed to a handful of individuals, with 
shifts in a team's performance often linked 
to a single or a few individuals transitioning 
between companies. 
 
• The migration of researchers to other Chi-
nese firms combined with the creation of 
new cyber security companies, is likely lead-
ing to an expansion and diversification of 
China's offensive cyber capabilities. 
 
 
Key Points 
• From 2017 to 2023, China accounted for 27% 
of all vulnerabilities reported to the bug 
bounty programs of Apple, Google Android, 
and Microsoft, contrasting with the rest of 
the world at 59%.

From 2017 to 2020, Chinese researchers contributed 
916 vulnerabilities to Google. This represents 56% of 
the vulnerabilities reported worldwide to Google 
Android (approx. 19 vulnerability reports per month). 
By contrast, the rest of the world accounted for 955 
vulnerabilities (44%). Qihoo 360’s research teams 
were the primary contributors (figure 19). Collectively, 
the Qihoo teams reported almost 70% of all the 
vulnerabilities reported by Chinese researchers. This is 
almost as many vulnerabilities as reported by the rest 
of the world combined. A handful of individual 
researchers within the Qihoo teams were particularly 
impactful. 
Within 
360 
C0RE, 
over 
60% 
of  
vulnerabilities were reported by Mingjian Zhou either 
individually or in collaboration with a few additional 
team members. In 2017, 360 C0RE was recognized by 
the Android Security Team as the platform’s “top 
research team" for submitting 118 vulnerability 
reports.359

Within 360 Alpha, nearly all vulnerabilities were 
reported by Guang Gong. In 2018, Google awarded 
Guang Gong 112.000 USD, then Google’s largest bug 
bounty payout ever, for the submission of a remote 
exploit chain on a Google's Pixel phone.360 In 360 
IceSword, over half were reported by Chen Gengjia, 
either individually or in collaboration with other team 
members. Within 360 SRC, over 50% of vulnerabilities 
were reported by Han Zinuo. In Baidu Labs, nearly half 
of their submitted vulnerabilities were reported by 
two researchers, Chenfu Bao and Lenx Wie.  
 
Between 2021 and 2023, China reported 680 
vulnerabilities to Google Android, making up a mere 
35% of the global total (approx. 19 vulnerabilities per 
month). By comparison, the rest of the world 
contributed 1175 vulnerabilities, accounting for 65% 
of the total (figure 20). Qihoo’s 360 teams accounted 
for only 16% of all the vulnerabilities reported by 
Chinese researchers, whereas the Oppo Amber 
Security Lab accounted for over 40%. Oppo is a leading 
Chinese 
consumer 
electronics 
manufacturer 
specializing in smartphones, smart devices, audio 
devices, and various other electronic products. Most 
vulnerabilities reported by OPPO were credited to Han 
Zinuo, who left Qihoo’s 360 SRC team for OPPO in 
2020. Following his departure, the submissions from 
360 
SRC 
significantly 
declined 
while 
OPPO 
experienced a notable surge. Out of the 300 
vulnerabilities reported by OPPO, the overwhelming 
majority can be attributed to Han Zinuo.

The overall decrease in vulnerability submission by 
Chinese researchers to Google Android might have 
been partially driven by the U.S. government’s 
crackdown on Huawei. In May 2019, Google 
suspended Huawei’s Android license, which at the 
time accounted for 40% of the Chinese smartphone 
market. 361 362 The reduction of the Qihoo 360’s 
submissions in the years 2021-2023 are likely linked 
to the U.S. sanctions levied against Qihoo 360 in May 
2020.363 During this period, many security researchers 
either left Qihoo, joined other companies, or possibly 
changed their researcher focus. Han Zinuo’s move to 
Oppo ought to be viewed in this light, as Oppo’s 
operating system is based on Android Open-Source 
Project, which also explains the company’s focus on 
reporting Android vulnerabilities.364

From 2017 to 2020, Chinese researchers contributed 
863 vulnerabilities to Microsoft, constituting 27% of 
the global total (approx. 18 vulnerabilities per 
month). The rest of the world reported 1580 
vulnerabilities (∼50%) 713 vulnerabilities (23%) were 
submitted anonymously. The primary contributors to 
Microsoft’s bug bounty program are Chinese research 
teams with a track record in hacking competitions 
(figure 21).  
Qihoo 360 was responsible for close to 60% of all 
Chinese submissions. The 360 Vulcan team reported 
most of these. Vulcan team member Yuki Chen 
reported 215 of the 314 vulnerabilities submitted. In 
2020 alone, Yuki Chen reported 106 vulnerabilities to 
Microsoft. He has been recognized as the top global 
bug hunter by the Microsoft Security Response Center 
(MSRC) in 2019365, 2021366, 2022367, and 2023.368

Tencent, which was represented by the Xuanwu Lab, 
the Keen Security Lab, and the Zhanlu Lab, collectively 
contributed approx. 13% of all vulnerabilities reported 
by Chinese researchers. A large portion were 
submitted by Xuanwu’s Moon Liang, Keen Security 
Lab’s Peter Hlavaty, and Zhanlu’s Ranchoice. The other 
teams exhibit relatively comparable levels of 
contribution.  
From 2021 to 2023, Chinese entities reported 783 
vulnerabilities to Microsoft, making up 18% of the 
global total (approx. 22 vulnerabilities per month). 
The rest of the world reported 3290 vulnerabilities 
(75%). 328 vulnerabilities (7%) were reported 
anonymously (figure 22). 
The Kunlun Lab accounted for approx. 41% (319 out of 
783) of the total vulnerabilities submitted by Chinese 
researchers. 
62% 
(197) 
of 
the 
vulnerabilities 
submitted by Kunlun Lab were reported by Yuki Chen 
who left 360 Vulcan in 2020. Today, the Kunlun Lab 
stands out as the unparalleled China-based reporter 
of vulnerabilities to the MSRC. For Microsoft's April 
2022 Patch Tuesday, it reported 36 of the 145 
vulnerabilities fixed, including half of the 10 critical 
vulnerabilities addressed.369

The 
other 
Chinese 
teams 
exhibit 
relatively 
comparable levels of contributions. Sangfor Lights Lab 
and the Ant Security Lightyear Lab were rising stars at 
the Tianfu Cup as well. Sangfor likely greatly 
benefited from former 360 C0RE member Peng 
Zhiniang joining its ranks. Peng left Qihoo 360 to 
become Sangfor’s Security Department’s CTO in late 
2020.370 Between 2021 and 2023, he contributed to 
the reporting of 69 of Sangfor’s 74 submitted 
vulnerabilities. The third largest contributor in 2021-
2023, kap0k, is likely associated with the South China 
University of Technology’s (华南理工大学) kap0K CTF 
team, which was established in March 2017. 31 of the 
51 vulnerabilities submitted by the Ant Security 
Lightyear Lab were reported by researcher Zhang 
Ziming.371 
Qihoo 360’s participation in Microsoft’s bug bounty 
program dramatically reduced after 2020. This is 
attributable to US sanctions against the company and 
the departure of key talent, such as Yuki Chen and 
Peng Zhiniang. Despite the submission reduction, 360 
IceSword researchers identified a vulnerability in the 
Hyper-V virtualization engine in 2021, resulting in a 
200.000 USD bounty — at the time the largest bounty 
ever awarded by Microsoft. Tencent also significantly 
reduced its contributions during the same period.

Between 2017 and 2020, Chinese researchers 
reported 307 vulnerabilities to Apple's bug bounty 
program, which represents ∼15% of the global total 
(approx. 6 vulnerabilities per month). By contrast, the 
rest of the world reported 957 vulnerabilities (47%). 
785 
vulnerabilities 
(33%) 
were 
reported 
anonymously. The primary Chinese contributors were 
from research teams with a track record in hacking 
competitions 
(figure 
23). 
Collectively, 
Qihoo 
accounted for 31% of the total vulnerabilities 
reported to Apple by Chinese researchers. Tencent 
comes at a close second, with approx. 18%. The Ant 
Security Lightyear Lab follows with 17% of total 
vulnerabilities submitted.  
Figure 24: Vulnerabilities Submitted to Apple (2021-Jan 22) 
 
 
 
 
Between 2021 and January 2022, Chinese researchers 
reported 142 vulnerabilities to Apple, comprising 
∼28% of the global total (approx. 11 vulnerabilities 
per month). By contrast, the rest of the world reported 
197 vulnerabilities (38%). 175 vulnerabilities (34%) 
were reported anonymously. Among the Chinese 
submissions, the Ant Security Lightyear Lab stands 
out with 46% of all disclosed vulnerabilities (figure 
24). Despite the lack of more recent data, we can 
assume that the Ant Security Lightyear Lab – due its 
dominant role in previous years – will continue to play 
a key role among Chinese researchers submitting 
vulnerabilities to Apple’s bug bounty program. This 
assumption is further supported by the lab’s 
performance at the Tianfu Cup 2023 in which it 
secured the 1st place.

Finding China-based bug bounty platforms and ob-
taining information on payouts for critical vulnerabil-
ity submissions is challenging. According to a source 
who was granted anonymity for this report, there are 
a few bug bounty programs available in China. Qi-
hoo’s 360 BugCloud and the Tencent Security Re-
sponse Center are operated by local companies which 
primarily test their own devices. These bug bounty 
program have stringent terms and offer either un-
specified rewards or pay outs that are relatively 
low.372 The YesWeHack website, which handles pay-
outs on behalf of Tencent, states that Tencent offers 
a maximum payout of 6.425 USD for a critical vulner-
ability.373 By contrast, Microsoft provides detailed 
breakdowns of maximum payouts for each product, 
with the highest being 250.000 USD for critical vul-
nerabilities in Microsoft Hyper-V. Such differences 
also hold true when it comes exploit acquisition plat-
forms.

Initiatives like the NVWA Project's bug bounty pro-
gram (女娲计划), which was launched by the Chinese 
Academy of Sciences' Software Research and Devel-
opment Center, provide varying rewards for identify-
ing vulnerabilities in both domestic and international 
products (table 5). The platform features a compre-
hensive list called the "Long-term Table," which enu-
merates 213 global products and systems and the 
maximum rewards for zero-day vulnerabilities for 
each of them. The majority of these vulnerabilities 
must be "zero-click" exploits, with only a few allowing 
"1-click" zero-days.  
 
The highest payouts on NVWA include critical vulner-
abilities in Android (2.8 million USD), iOS (2 million 
USD), WhatsApp (1.4 million USD), Telegram (695.000 
USD), Cisco (694.580 USD), Chrome (417.000 USD), 
and Microsoft (139.000 USD). The average payout for 
a vulnerability is approximately 35.500 USD.

While the anonymous source acknowledged that 
NVWA is one of the most popular exploit acquisition 
platforms in China, the author was unable to verify 
whether it is among the exploiting acquisition plat-
forms with the highest payouts in China. 
 
By comparison, U.S.-based exploit acquisition plat-
form Zerodium offers payouts of up to 2.5 million 
USD.374 Back in 2018, a startup based in the United 
Arab Emirates called Crowdfense introduced bounties 
of up to 3 million USD for either partial or complete 
zero or one-click exploit chains targeting Windows, 
MacOS, iOS, and Android.375 In late-2023, the Russian 
zero-day acquisition firm, Operation Zero, increased 
its rewards to 20 million USD for exploit chains affect-
ing both Android and iOS platforms. It is unclear what 
the maximum reward would be for a single exploit.376  
 
Interestingly, some of the China-based platforms, 
such as 360 BugCloud, operate under a "talk about 
money first, then hand over holes" model, which al-
lows researchers to negotiate their compensation 
terms.377 However, like for hacking competitions, 
when Chinese researchers report vulnerabilities on 
relevant platforms, they may be required to share a 
significant portion of the bounty prize with their em-
ployer. According to insights from a source that was 
granted anonymity for this report, this split can occa-
sionally reach up to 50%. While Chinese researchers 
can still make a lot of money by reporting vulnerabili-
ties to international bug bounty programs, several 
challenges persist. These include U.S. sanctions 
against prominent Chinese companies, such as Qihoo 
360, and Beijing’s punishing measures as seen in the 
case of the Log4j incident, which possibly generated a 
climate of fear among Chinese researchers to report 
vulnerabilities to non-Chinese vendors. It is probable 
that vulnerabilities reported to Chinese third-party 
platforms, such as the NVWA Project, are shared with 
government authorities in line with relevant regula-
tions. 
 
This is particularly likely in the case of the NVWA Pro-
ject due to its strong ties to the state. The Chinese 
Academy of Sciences (CAS), which oversees the plat-
form, is one of three academic institutions directly un-
der the State Council of the People's Republic of 
China.378 Constitutionally, the State Council serves as 
the executive branch of the National People's Con-
gress, the highest state power organ, and the top ad-
ministrative body in the country.379 CAS actively par-
ticipates in the promotion of MCF through its own 
Military-Civil Fusion Development Research Cen-
tre.380 It also sponsors the Tianfu Cup.

8     Conclusion 
 
This report has identified China's primary civilian 
hacking teams and their research focuses on Western 
products and systems by examining their participa-
tion in prominent hacking competitions and bug 
bounty programs. More broadly, it has explored how 
these initiatives perpetuate a cycle of talent develop-
ment and innovation, enabling individual hackers to 
refine their skills, establish new companies specializ-
ing in both offensive and defensive cyber capabilities, 
and to set up new China-based hacking competitions. 
This process sustains China’s offensive cyber ecosys-
tem in the long run. 
 
This is significant because China’s offensive cyber eco-
system leverage civilian talent in unprecedented ways 
for state-sponsored cyber operations. High-perform-
ing Chinese hacking teams in prominent competitions 
and bug bounty programs are often affiliated with 
companies that collaborate with government agen-
cies on a wide spectrum of cyber activities, including 
supplying them with a significant number of vulnera-
bilities for offensive purposes. 
 
China’s approach has enabled it to enhance the effi-
cacy of its cyber operations against foreign targets 
while introducing operational asymmetries with other 
states. This is attributed to certain elements of China's 
offensive cyber ecosystem, such as the flow of vulner-
abilities from the private sector to government agen-
cies, which may pose ethical dilemmas for democratic 
states to replicate. This is because it could potentially 
conflict with their fundamental values, such as trans-
parency and responsible vulnerability disclosure.  
 
It ultimately rests with each country to determine 
whether and which elements of the Chinese model to 
adopt based on its own values and specific needs. 
However, it is crucial to consider the risks, especially if 
government agencies circumvent the vulnerability 
disclosure process to stockpile vulnerabilities. For in-
stance, in 2016, a hacking group called the Shadow 
Brokers hacked and disclosed a cache of stockpiled 
NSA cyber capabilities, including the EternalBlue vul-
nerability, which was later used in the devastating 
WannaCry and NotPetya ransomware attacks. Addi-
tionally, the misuse of vulnerability findings could un-
dermine confidence in the disclosure process and dis-
suade researchers from reporting vulnerabilities. 
 
Broadly, states can draw inspiration from China's ho-
listic approach, particularly its robust integration of 
hacking competitions and bug bounty submissions 
into university curricula and corporate cultures. By 
adopting similar practices, democracies can empower 
civilian hackers to identify and cultivate their 
strengths while fostering networks of skilled individu-
als. This can significantly enhance the cybersecurity 
posture of the organizations they engage with, ulti-
mately contributing to the broader cybersecurity eco-
system, including national security objectives. 
 
Future studies in this area may explore how states can 
strategically leverage aspects of China's cyber ap-
proach that align with their core values, while also ad-
dressing security implications arising from resulting 
asymmetries in cyber intelligence and defense. This 
entails a nuanced examination of how to effectively 
mitigate any associated risks. At a more granular level, 
further research could delve into China-based hacking 
competitions and other pertinent actors that may not 
have been fully explored in this report.
