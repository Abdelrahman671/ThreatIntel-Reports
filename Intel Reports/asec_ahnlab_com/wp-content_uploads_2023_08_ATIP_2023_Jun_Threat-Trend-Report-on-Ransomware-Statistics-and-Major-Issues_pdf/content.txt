Threat Trend Report on Ransomware (June 2023) 
5 
Objectives and Scope 
This report provides statistics on new ransomware samples, attacked systems, and 
targeted businesses in June 2023, as well as notable ransomware issues in Korea and other 
countries. Other major issues and statistics for ransomware that are not mentioned in the 
report can be found by searching for the following keywords or via the Statistics menu at 
AhnLab Threat Intelligence Platform (ATIP). 
 
Ransomware 
Statistics by Type 
 
The number of ransomware samples and targeted systems are based on the detection 
names designated by AhnLab, and the statistics on targeted businesses are based on the 
time the information on the ransomware group's dedicated leak sites (DLS, identical to 
ransomware PR sites or PR pages) was collected by the ATIP infrastructure. 
 
 
Major Statistics 
1) Data Sources and Collection Methods 
ATIP uses its internal infrastructure to monitor and analyze the following ransomware 
information. 
 
List of malicious files and behaviors detected and collected by AhnLab Smart 
Defense (ASD) 
List of targeted businesses posted on ransomware groups' DLS 
 
The number of new ransomware samples and statistics on targeted systems were 
calculated based on the detection names designated by AhnLab. They were also limited to 
cases where the detected files and behaviors were diagnosed under the category of 
"Ransomware/" or "Ransom/". 
 
Ransomware/Win.Magniber: Example of file detection name 
Threat Trend Report on Ransomware (June 2023) 
6 
Ransom/MDP.Magniber: Example of behavior detection name 
 
The detection names acquired at the time of detection may not allow for the identification 
of ransomware type (e.g. Generic, Agent, Edit, Decoy, and others), and some cases may be 
excluded from the ransomware statistics or be counted as a different ransomware type 
due to changed detection names after detection or a failed detection. 
 
The statistics on targeted businesses are the values that have been organized based on the 
data accumulated through regular monitoring of ransomware groups' DLS, where the 
groups reveal the targeted businesses. If the DLS page was inaccessible or the collection 
happened late, then the data may have been excluded from the statistics or have been 
considered to be collected at a time different from the exact date the victim was revealed. 
 
Therefore, this report should be used as a reference to check the general trends of 
ransomware samples and targeted systems and to see which ransomware groups are 
actively engaged in attacks through the statistics on targeted businesses to gain a general 
understanding of trends. 
 
 
2) Overall Ransomware Statistics 
The total number of new ransomware samples collected during the past six months is as 
follows. 
 
 
Figure 1. Number of new ransomware samples 
 
Threat Trend Report on Ransomware (June 2023) 
7 
Magniber, which displayed a rapid increase in February 2023, decreased in March; however, 
it is slowly on the rise again. In June, the overall number of new samples increased by about 
30% compared to last month. The cause of this phenomenon was found to be the increase 
in the number of simple variant samples of the Magniber, Azov, and StopCrypt ransomware. 
 
The table below shows the total numbers after removing duplicate data of ransomware 
files used in targeted systems and infection (We chose to use the term "targeted systems", 
yet it should be understood as systems where ransomware files and behaviors were 
detected or systems that were exposed to infections). 
 
 
Figure 2. Systems and files affected by ransomware 
 
With Magniberâ€™s infection attempts decreasing by 40% compared to May, the targeted 
systems totaled up to 5,283.  
 
The total number of ransomware behavior detection (MDP)-based targeted systems and 
blocked report cases are as follows. 
 
Threat Trend Report on Ransomware (June 2023) 
8 
 
Figure 3. Ransomware behavior detection-based targeted systems and reports 
 
Behavior detection system statistics also showed a 30% decrease compared to the 
previous month, mirroring the trend observed in the targeted system statistics. The 
number of blocks also decreased by about the same percentage. 
 
 
3) New Samples by Ransomware 
Below is the statistics showing the 4,665 new samples that were discovered in June 
organized by ransomware type. Only 20 ransomware with the most samples are shown. 
 
 
Figure 4. Number of new samples per ransomware (June 2023) 
 
As mentioned in the overall ransomware statistics, it can be seen that the number of simple 
variant samples of the Magniber, Azov, and StopCrypt ransomware has increased. 
Threat Trend Report on Ransomware (June 2023) 
9 
Magniber saw an increase of about 20% in comparison to the previous month, being the 
most collected ransomware. There were no significant changes to the number of other 
ransomware. 
 
 
4) Targeted Systems by Ransomware 
The top 20 cases with the highest number of files used in targeted systems and infection 
are as follows (duplicates have been excluded).  
 
 
Figure 5. Number of targeted systems and files per ransomware (June 2023) 
 
The number of systems targeted by Magniber decreased by about 40% from 8,600 in the 
previous month, which is at a similar level to those of March and April.  
 
The following shows the statistics on the number of systems targeted daily extracted from 
the top 12 ransomware. 
 
Threat Trend Report on Ransomware (June 2023) 
10 
 
Figure 6. Daily number of targeted systems per ransomware (June 2023) 
 
Cases of Magniber infection were the highest in the daily statistics as well. Aside from the 
typical fluctuations such as a slight decrease in attacks during weekends and increased 
attempts at infection on Mondays and Tuesdays, the daily number of systems affected by 
Magniber stayed at an average of 300. Infection attempts had been made steadily 
throughout June without there being a spike on certain days. It has been identified that 
attempts had increased slightly after Sunday, June 18. Attacks involving MSI files disguised 
with 
the 
file 
names 
"ERROR.Software.Log", 
"System.ERROR.Log", 
"MS.Update.Center.Security", and "System.Upgrade.Win10.0" showed an increase. There 
were also LockBit and StopCrypt emails involving attachments disguised as "resumes", "job 
applications", and "guidelines on unauthorized use of licenses", as well as infection 
attempts by a Jigsaw file disguised as "Windows Update Assistant.exe". 
 
 
5) Targeted Businesses by Ransomware Group 
Below are the statistics on targeted businesses posted on the ransomware groups' DLS 
collected by ATIP. As data on some ransomware groups were collected late or could not be 
collected, refer to "Targeted Businesses by Ransomware Group (External Statistics)" that 
follows. 
 
Threat Trend Report on Ransomware (June 2023) 
11 
 
Figure 7. Number of Targeted Businesses by Ransomware Group (June 2023) 
 
LOCKBIT 3.0, which was ranked first last month, has seen a slight decrease in the number 
of targeted businesses that have been disclosed on the DLS. After CLOP became known for 
exploiting the MOVEit zero-day vulnerability discovered in late May to exfiltrate data from 
hundreds of companies, the number of victims disclosed by this group increased, totaling 
56 in June. This was the second-highest number on the list. (The reason that the CLOP 
count is lower than that in the external statistics below is due to the Captcha applied to the 
CLOP DLS.) Please refer to the "Key Trends" section below for more information regarding 
CLOP. 
 
While not included in the current statistics, 26 victims were uploaded to the Akira 
ransomware DLS and 38 victims on the DLS of 8Base ransomware in June. 
 
Some of the targeted businesses revealed per ransomware group can be seen below.

6) Targeted Businesses by Ransomware Group (External 
Statistics) 
The statistics on targeted businesses during the same period were provided by DarkFeed 
Twitter, run by an external TI business or security expert, and this can be seen below. The 
report used statistical information that was available from DarkFeed or Dailydarkweb 
Twitter at the time of writing.

through ATIP if the current security management system or situation requires so. 
 
 
1) CLOP Ransomware Exploits the MOVEit Zero-day 
Vulnerability 
On May 31, 2023, Progress released an advisory regarding a serious vulnerability (CVE-
2023-34362) that arises in MOVEit Transfer.  MOVEit Transfer is a managed file transfer 
(MFT) software developed by Ipswitch, a subsidiary of Progress, a US company. 
 
Please refer to the following ATIP security advisory for details on the CVE-2023-34362 
vulnerability (including additionally discovered vulnerabilities). 
 
atip.ahnlab.com: MOVEit Transfer Security Update Advisory (CVE-2023-34362, CVE-2023-35036, 
CVE-2023-35708) 
 
The issue of "CLOP ransomware's activities involving the exploitation of the MOVEit zero-
day vulnerability and the group's disclosure of their victims" was brought into the spotlight 
on June 1, the day after the MOVEit Transfer vulnerability was disclosed. This is possibly 
the ransomware issue that was most mentioned and given the most attention by security 
companies and the media in June. Major details of this issue will be summarized in 
chronological order in this report.  
 
After June 1, 2023 
 
Cyber criminals are actively exploiting the MOVEit Transfer zero-day vulnerability. Articles 
are being written on the fact that threat actors can execute codes remotely through SQL 
injection and steal data from their targets. No mention has been made of the relationship 
between the MOVEit Transfer vulnerability and CLOP as of yet; technical details of the 
vulnerability itself and its impact formed the majority.

On June 5, Microsoft posted a tweet saying that an attack exploiting the MOVEit Transfer 
vulnerability has been identified and classified it as the CLOP ransomware group's activity.  
 
 
Figure 9. Microsoft's tweet regarding the identification of CLOP ransomware - Source 
twitter.com 
 
After the tweet from Microsoft, the CLOP ransomware group announced on 
bleepingcomputer that they were behind the data theft attack involving the MOVEit 
Transfer vulnerability. The group claimed that they exploited this vulnerability to intrude 
the servers of hundreds of companies and stole data from them.  The CLOP ransomware 
group revealed that they had commenced exploitation of this vulnerability on May 27, the 
Memorial Day weekend in the US. Zellis, a payroll service provider for British Airways and 
BBC, was mentioned as the first victim. 
 
On June 6, Malwarebytes Labs also published the same news, citing the Microsoft tweet 
and the bleepingcomputer article.
 From this point, the issue "CLOP ransomware's 
activities involving the exploitation of the MOVEit zero-day vulnerability and the group's 
disclosure of their victims" secured its place as the most important ransomware issue of 
June.

In the same time period, the CLOP ransomware group uploaded a notice on their DLS 
notifying all potential victims that use MOVEit products instead of contacting them 
individually via email. 
 
 
Figure 10. The CLOP ransomware group's post on their DLS (June 6) 
 
The CLOP ransomware group announced on their DLS that they had stolen data from 
hundreds of companies, and if the ransom is not paid, the group will begin to release the 
names and data from the infiltrated companies on June 14. 
 
After June 7, 2023 
 
On June 7, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) released a cyber 
security advisory revealing the findings of their investigations with the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation (FBI). The advisory announced that the CLOP ransomware group commenced 
exploiting the zero-day SQL injection vulnerability (CVE-2023-34362) that occurs in the 
MOVEit Transfer solution. It continued to explain that the MOVEit Transfer program with 
internet access was infected with a web shell called LEMURLOOT and was used to steal data 
from the MOVEit Transfer database.  It includes the fact that the CLOP ransomware group 
had launched zero-day exploit-based campaigns on Accellion File Transfer Appliance (FTA)

in 2020 and 2021, and GoAnywhere MFT servers in early 2023. The advisory also provides 
the known IOC and TTP of the CLOP ransomware group.

www.bleepingcomputer.com: Clop ransomware likely testing MOVEit zero-day since 2021 (Jun. 8) 
 
After June 14, 2023 
 
Starting June 14, the CLOP ransomware group started revealing the names and data of 
their victims on their DLS as they have forewarned on June 6. For more details on the 
companies that suffered damage from the CLOP ransomware infection through the 
exploitation of the MOVEit vulnerability, please refer to the ATIP report and news below.

A comparison of the details posted at the top of the CLOP ransomware group's DLS page 
over three weeks shows that a significant number of victims are being gradually disclosed. 
Also, companies from a variety of industries as well as famous large-scale businesses are 
included.

Additionally, like the following details presented in the "3) Significantly More Businesses 
Targeted by CLOP Ransomware" section of the "March 2023 Threat Trend Report on 
Ransomware" , the CLOP ransomware group took their time to prepare for announcements

and negotiations for a month even after successfully exfiltrating data from the breached 
companies. Some ransomware groups including CLOP seem to have a pool of victims and 
invest a long period of time to seek methods to maximize their profits. Seeing from the fact 
that CLOP had reused the same strategy from the past, it seems that negotiations over 
such a long period of pressurization are effective. 
 
After June 17, 2023 
 
On June 17, after the CLOP ransomware group was found to have infiltrated many federal 
organizations in relation to the MOVEit data leakage incident, the US government made an 
announcement, offering up to $10 million in rewards for information on the CLOP 
ransomware gang with ties to foreign governments, as a part of the Rewards for Justice 
program. 
 
However, the CLOP ransomware group deleted the government data and continued to 
disclose names of new victims, claiming that they are not interested in politics and are only 
motivated by money.

After June 22, 2023 
 
Due to the data theft attack through the MOVEit Transfer vulnerability, Progress was facing 
a class-action lawsuit. The plaintiffs claimed that Progress failed to devise an adequate 
security measure, monitor the networks, train their staff, or give timely notice on the 
incident.

Progress Software (Jun. 22) 
 
As of finishing this section in late June, tens of victims are being updated on the DLS. The 
issue of "CLOP ransomware's activities involving the exploitation of the MOVEit zero-day 
vulnerability and the group's disclosure of their victims" will likely persist for some time. 
 
To prevent attacks by ransomware, organizations and individuals who use software that 
can be directly used in malware infection such as file transfer protocols must apply the 
Threat Trend Report on Ransomware (June 2023) 
20 
latest security updates and uninstall unnecessary software. The regular guidelines of 
practicing periodic backups as well as installing, using, and updating security software 
must also be followed.

2) BlackSuit Ransomware Compared to Royal Ransomware 
Based on the blog post "Investigating BlackSuit Ransomware's Similarities to Royal"  by 
Trend Micro, bleepingcomputer uploaded the article "Royal ransomware gang adds 
BlackSuit encryptor to their arsenal".  
 
Royal Ransomware, one of the ransomware that came to light in 2022, became even more 
notorious from their attack on the IT system of the city of Dallas, TX, in early May of 2023, 
causing the city's IT services to be suspended. In a similar time period, many security 
researchers uploaded tweets on the discovery of new ransomware called BlackSuit 
targeting both Windows and Linux platforms. 
 
Trend Micro's post contains details of the comparison between this BlackSuit ransomware 
and Royal obtained from analysis. Out of the Royal and BlackSuit ransomware samples, the 
x64 ESXi version of the sample targeting Linux systems was analyzed using BinDiff , a 
binary file comparison tool. Results showed that 98% of the functions, 99.5% of blocks, 
and 98.9% of the jump (JUMP OPCODE) were similar, leading to the conclusion that the files 
were almost the same. It was also mentioned that aside from the similarities in code, the 
command arguments used, the fact that AES of OpenSSL was used in the encryption 
algorithm and that the intermittent encryption method was employed to ensure quick file

encryption were all similar. 
 
Please refer to the following for details regarding the Royal and BlackSuit ransomware.

Among the revealed IOCs of the BlackSuit ransomware, this report will examine the 
operation process of the file with the following hash, which is a 32-bit PE file. 
 
90ae0c693f6ffd6dc5bb2d5a5ef078629c3d77f874b2d2ebd9e109d8ca049f2c 
 
Executing the file with an arbitrary 32-byte string to the command argument "-name" used 
as the "victim ID" (111...111 was used for the test) showed that encrypted files had the file 
extension ".BlackSuit" added and a ransom note file titled "README.BlackSuit.txt" was 
generated in all encrypted directories, as shown below.

Figure 13. BlackSuit ransomware's ransom note - README.BlackSuit.txt 
 
The Royal ransomware group is a Russian cyber crime organization that has been active 
since September 2022 and is known to be run independently, instead of as a ransomware-
as-a-service (RaaS). They are active in Germany, the US, Brazil, Canada, Australia, and Italy. 
The group exploited the VMware ESXi vulnerability (CVE-2021-21974) in February 2023, 
infecting many servers worldwide. The group uses the BatLoader, Royal, and Zeon 
ransomware and is known to have derived from the Conti ransomware group. 
 
For details regarding the VMware ESXi vulnerability (CVE-2021-21974), please refer to the 
ATIP reports below. 
 
atip.ahnlab.com: Security Update Advisory for VMware ESXi OpenSLP Vulnerability (CVE-2021-
21974) (This report supports Korean only for now.)

The BlackSuit ransomware is an independent ransomware that runs a separate DLS to 
disclose their victims. It can evolve into a subsidiary group or a rebranding of the Royal 
ransomware group. As of this report being written in late June, a total of three companies 
are listed as victims on the BlackSuit ransomware DLS. 
 
However, some say that because there is a clear similarity between the encryption 
programs of the BlackSuit and Royal ransomware as shown in the file comparison on the 
Trend Micro blog, it is difficult to persuade that BlackSuit is a new ransomware group and 
rebranding is no longer meaningful.

Additionally, a diagram of the relationship between Conti and Royal ransomware from the 
file "OCD_WorldWatch_Ransomware-ecosystem-map.pdf" provided on github.com is as 
follows. We recommend examining the rebranding, similarity, and variant relationships 
among other ransomware besides Conti and Royal.

As mentioned above, only time will tell if the BlackSuit ransomware will become an 
unfortunate statistic disappearing after a failure to rebrand as an independent subject and

only being mentioned for a while, or if it will successfully be rebranded and be listed on the 
Ransomware-ecosystem-map in the future. 
 
The emergence of the BlackSuit ransomware has pertinence to the Royal ransomware, and 
this is concrete proof that ransomware operators are editing existing codes to develop 
unique ransomware to find more effective attack tools for extorting financial gains from 
their victims. Thus, both organizations and individuals must follow the guidelines including 
applying the latest security updates, removing unnecessary software, practicing regular 
backups, and installing, using, and updating security software to protect their files and data 
from ransomware attacks.

3) Akira Ransomware Infects Linux Systems 
The Akira ransomware group, which first became known in March 2023, has been highly 
active since May. As of the present day in late June, about 50 companies have been 
uploaded as victims on the group's DLS. On June 28, bleepingcomputer uploaded an article 
saying that the Akira ransomware group has been using Linux-based ransomware to 
launch double extortion attacks against companies worldwide that use the VMware ESXi 
virtual machine.

The Akira ransomware previously attacked Windows systems only, but it has recently been 
discovered that their attacks have expanded to Linux systems. This seems to be a strategic 
change for the purpose of increasing their profits through the expansion of target 
platforms following the other ransomware groups that have recently begun to attack Linux 
systems. Ransomware that targets Linux systems besides Akira includes Royal and 
BlackSuit mentioned above, as well as LockBit, BlackMatter, AvosLocker, REvil, HelloKitty,

servers/

RansomEXX, and Hive. Recently, a Linux system version of the Trigona ransomware was 
also discovered.  
 
Based on the hash of the Akira ransomware for Linux announced on a tweet by rivitna, the 
results of its file execution will be examined.  
// 1d3b5c650533d13c81e325972a912e3ff8776e36e18bca966dae50735f8ab296 
 
The following separate command arguments must be given for Akira upon execution. 
 
--encryption_path: Path of the system file for infection 
--share_file: Path of the network for infection 
--encryption_percent: Encryption rate for infection targets 
 
The test was only run with the target path for infection designated in the "--
encryption_path" argument. The file extension ".akira" is added to the file names after 
encryption, and the ransom note file "akira_readme.txt" is generated in each directory. The 
file "akira_readme.txt" was created without permission, as shown in the image below.

Additionally, AVAST released a recovery tool for Akira on June 29.  
 
It is not often that a recovery tool is released for ransomware, but a search may be 
performed on the following websites for reference materials.

Figure 17. Akira ransom note "akira_readme.txt" 
 
A unique password for negotiation assigned to each victim is included at the bottom of the 
"akira_readme.txt" ransom note file. Aside from the .onion address used as the DLS for 
disclosing victims and exfiltrating data, the Akira ransomware group also runs a .onion 
website described as the "chat room". The site "chat room" has a web-based chat system 
that the victim can use to negotiate with the ransomware group. This system is used to 
present the list of exfiltrated files as evidence and proceed with the negotiations.

For details regarding Akira's DLS for introduction to the group and disclosure of its victims 
as well as the "chat room", please refer to the ATIP reports below.

Figure 18. The Akira ransomware group's "chat room" 
 
While various methods such as email attachments, inducing visits to malicious websites, 
and phishing emails are used to infect Windows systems with ransomware, such attack 
methods are not effective infection strategies in Linux systems as they are usually used as 
servers on separate physical servers or in VMware ESXi virtual machines. There are many 
ransomware including Akira that are expanding their targets to Linux systems, so the latest 
security updates must be applied for any applications in use, and any unused software must 
be uninstalled.

Conclusion 
There are periodic changes in ransomware samples and targeted system numbers 
according to the success rates of attack campaigns and early infection attempts. As can be 
seen in the statistics above, these numbers vary from hundreds to thousands. After having 
been attacked by ransomware groups, hundreds of businesses were also posted on DLS. 
 
As can be seen in the trends above, ransomware attack groups actively exploit the 
vulnerabilities of operating systems and software used by corporations. In the case of 
private users, the threat groups take advantage of users' negligence, use malware carefully 
disguised as normal software, or exploit vulnerabilities that bypass security software. 
According to the characteristics used in initial infection attempts, corporate and private 
users are advised to adhere to the following guidelines to protect and manage their major 
assets.
