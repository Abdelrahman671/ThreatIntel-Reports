CERT-UA
General information
At the beginning of the fierce 2022, the CERT-UA Ukrainian Supervisory Computer Response Team, as
one of the coordinating subjects, took away information about the detection of potentially scalable
programs on the computers of spivrobitniks.
Based on the results of the analysis, it was established that the data on objects should be checked for the
signs of shkidlivyh programs, classified as LightRope and LiteManager. Further correlation of indicators of
compromise, as well as tactics, techniques and procedures, allowed the activity to be associated with the
activities of the UAC-0008 group (Buhtrap). In view of the fact that the files of shkіdlivih programs were
signed with an electronic signature, the attack was specifically looked at before 01/16/2022.
Dovidkovo:
The Buhtrap group in the period from 2014 to 2016 recorded a low number of attacks , worse, on the
financial organizations of Russia. At the same time, in 2016, in 2016, incl., after the publication of the
victorious code of victorious programs, for unknown reasons, the group began to carry out attacks
exclusively against specific state authorities and enterprises of Ukraine, victorious, in the middle,
programmatically.
Depending on the nature of the injection on the information and telecommunication systems of the
attacked organizations, it is obvious that the group is fixed in the corporate measure of sacrifice and the
improvement of the process of taking away information, as it is processed in special systems of
organizations.
For a preliminary demonstration of the method of penetration of that victorious group of instruments, it is
important to visit the following incident, which may be the month of 2021.
So, apparently, for the help of electronic mail, the evil-doers created a rozposyudzhennya sending to the
shkidly document “2021-07-30-08-55-07.xlsm”. Once the document is opened and the macro activated
on the victim's computer, the file “output.exe” will be created, which is classified as the SourSnack
program. Remaining with the basic information about the computer, generating a DNS-query to the
control server, having removed the key from the output key, decoding the configuration file that was
created at the resource looking at the configuration file and further decrypting the payload, which appears
before the LightRope guesses (ale
Nadalі, LightRope zdіysny dekoduvannya vbudovannogo resource, saving the file on the computer and
the creation of a scheduled task to ensure the persistence of the launch of the rest. As a result, the
dnscat program will be installed on the victim's computer to give the attackers the ability to remotely steal
the add-on, tunneling information flows behind the DNS protocol.

Respectfully, that file-droppers, like vikoristovuyutsya group, as a rule, signed with a digital digital
signature.
Not a crossover of shkіdlivih programs that are victorious in a group:
dnscat - software security, spread out over various movable programs C. Designed to create an
encrypted channel for managing between a client and a server behind an additional DNS protocol.
Supported by *nix and Windows operating systems. Transferred functionality for remote viewing of
commands on the client through the terminal.
LiteManager is a smartly cost-free program with a lock-out code for remote administration and computer
management. Broken down by the Russian company LiteManagerTeam. The project is an official
continuation of the closed Remote Office Manager project. The client part is available for operating
systems: Windows, Android, Mac OS, iOS, iPhone, iPad.
SourSnack is a smart program, divided into different versions of C. It takes care of retrieving basic
information about the computer (GetComputerName, GetUserName, GetAdaptersInfo). There is a
connection with the management server for decrypting the encryption key for decrypting the PE file,
which is located at the encrypted resource, and saving it on the computer in the %APPDATA% directory
and further launch. For communication with the control server, the DNS protocol (TXT records) is used;
Information about EOM is encoded for help hex. To decrypt the resource, XOR is required; for decryption
of a PE file, an algorithm based on mathematical operations (XOR / DIV / MUL) is used, which
implements the transformation of blocks, the majority of which is assigned the encryption key.
LightRope is a tricky program, divided into different versions of C. It takes the role of a dropper, allowing
ZLIB decompression (may not be broken) and XOR decoding of the payload of the resource, as well as
the creation of a scheduled task. With the method of unification of the created files, the elements of their
resources can be filled with sufficient tribute.
NTDSDumpEx is a publicly available security software, recognized for extracting information from the
Active Directory database %SYSTEMROOT%\NTDS.dit, and itself: data about domain cloud records,
group memberships and password hashes.
RDPWrapper is a publicly available security software designed to make it possible to run multiple parallel
RDP sessions on a computer.
Ngrok is a publicly available software, recognized for the publication of any service (meadow port) on the
Internet through the tunneling of information flows.

Additional information
4/4
· It is recommended to change the so-called “attack surface” (attack surface), including for filtering mesh
ports for external information flows.
· With the method of revealing the facts of tunneling information flows behind the additional DNS protocol,
perform rechecking and further monitoring of the log files for the presence of anomalous DNS backlogs.
· Implement the possibility of centralized management of anti-virus protection on all non-powered
computers; transfer the ability to live on computers (launching Yara-rules, accessing shkіdlіvіh files,
searching for indicators then), in the first line, in remote access mode.
