Moonstone Sleet emerges as new North Korean threat actor with
new bag of tricks
⋮ 5/28/2024
Microsoft has identified a new North Korean threat actor, now tracked as Moonstone Sleet (formerly Storm-1789),
that uses both a combination of many tried-and-true techniques used by other North Korean threat actors and unique
attack methodologies to target companies for its financial and cyberespionage objectives. Moonstone Sleet is
observed to set up fake companies and job opportunities to engage with potential targets, employ trojanized versions
of legitimate tools, create a fully functional malicious game, and deliver a new custom ransomware.

Malicious tank game
Moonstone Sleet uses tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) also used by other North Korean threat actors over
the last several years, highlighting the overlap among these groups. While Moonstone Sleet initially had overlaps with
Diamond Sleet, the threat actor has since shifted to its own infrastructure and attacks, establishing itself as a distinct,
well-resourced North Korean threat actor.

This blog describes several notable TTPs used by this threat actor as well as recommendations to defend against
related attacks. As with any observed nation-state actor activity, Microsoft directly notifies customers that have been
targeted or compromised, providing them with the necessary information to secure their environments.

Who is Moonstone Sleet?
Moonstone Sleet is a threat actor behind a cluster of malicious activity that Microsoft assesses is North Korean state-
aligned and uses both a combination of many tried-and-true techniques used by other North Korean threat actors and
unique attack methodologies. When Microsoft first detected Moonstone Sleet activity, the actor demonstrated strong
overlaps with Diamond Sleet, extensively reusing code from known Diamond Sleet malware like Comebacker and
using well-established Diamond Sleet techniques to gain access to organizations, such as using social media to
deliver trojanized software. However, Moonstone Sleet quickly shifted to its own bespoke infrastructure and attacks.
Subsequently, Microsoft has observed Moonstone Sleet and Diamond Sleet conducting concurrent operations, with
Diamond Sleet still utilizing much of its known, established tradecraft.
Moonstone Sleet has an expansive set of operations supporting its financial and cyberespionage objectives. These
range from deploying custom ransomware to creating a malicious game, setting up fake companies, and using IT
workers.
Moonstone Sleet tradecraft
Microsoft has observed Moonstone Sleet using the TTPs discussed in the following sections in various campaigns.
Trojanized PuTTY
In early August 2023, Microsoft observed Moonstone Sleet delivering a trojanized version of PuTTY, an open-source
terminal emulator, via apps like LinkedIn and Telegram as well as developer freelancing platforms. Often, the actor
sent targets a .zip archive containing two files: a trojanized version of putty.exe and url.txt, which contained an IP
address and a password. If the provided IP and password were entered by the user into the PuTTY application, the
application would decrypt an embedded payload, then load and execute it. Notably, before Moonstone Sleet used this
initial access vector, Microsoft observed Diamond Sleet using a similar method – trojanized PuTTY and SumatraPDF
— with comparable techniques for anti-analysis, as we reported in 2022:
2/10
Figure 1. Code from PuTTY executable
The trojanized PuTTY executable drops a custom installer which kicks off execution of a series of stages of malware,
as described below:
1. Stage 1 – Trojanized PuTTY: Decrypts, decompresses, and then executes the embedded stage 2 payload.
2. Stage 2 – SplitLoader installer/dropper: Decrypts, decompresses, and writes the Stage 3 payload, the
SplitLoader DLL file, to disk. The installer also drops two encrypted files to disk, then executes SplitLoader via a
scheduled task or registry run key.
3. Stage 3 – SplitLoader:Decrypts and decompresses the two encrypted files dropped by the stage 2 payload,
then combines them to create the next-stage, another portable executable (PE) file.
4. Stage 4 – Trojan loader: Expects a compressed and encrypted PE file from the C2. Once received, the trojan
loader decompresses, decrypts, and executes this file.
Figure 2. Moonstone Sleet attack chain using trojanized PuTTY
Microsoft has also observed Moonstone Sleet using other custom malware loaders delivered by PuTTY that behaved
similarly and had argument overlap with previously observed Diamond Sleet malware artifacts, such as the following:
Malicious npm packages
Microsoft has observed Moonstone Sleet targeting potential victims with projects that used malicious npm packages.
Often, the threat actor delivered these projects through freelancing websites or other platforms like LinkedIn. In one
example, the threat actor used a fake company to send .zip files invoking a malicious npm package under the guise
of a technical skills assessment. When loaded, the malicious package used curl to connect to an actor-controlled IP
and drop additional malicious payloads like SplitLoader. In another incident, Moonstone Sleet delivered a malicious
npm loader which led to credential theft from LSASS. Microsoft collaborated with GitHub to identify and remove
repositories associated with this activity.
Malicious tank game
Since February 2024, Microsoft has observed Moonstone Sleet infecting devices using a malicious tank game it
developed called DeTankWar (also called DeFiTankWar, DeTankZone, or TankWarsZone). DeTankWar is a fully
functional downloadable game that requires player registration, including username/password and invite code. In this
3/10
campaign, Moonstone Sleet typically approaches its targets through messaging platforms or by email, presenting
itself as a game developer seeking investment or developer support and either masquerading as a legitimate
blockchain company or using fake companies. To bolster the game’s superficial legitimacy, Moonstone Sleet has also
created a robust public campaign that includes the websites detankwar[.]com and defitankzone[.]com, and many X
(Twitter) accounts for the personas it uses to approach targets and for the game itself.
Figure 3. Example of a Moonstone Sleet X (Twitter) account
for its DeTankWar game
Moonstone Sleet used a fake company called C.C. Waterfall to contact targets. The email presented the game as a
blockchain-related project and offered the target the opportunity to collaborate, with a link to download the game
included in the body of the message. More details about C.C. Waterfall and another fake company that Moonstone
Sleet set up to trick targets are included below:
Figure 4. Moonstone Sleet using CC Waterfall to email a link to their game
When targeted users launch the game, delfi-tank-unity.exe, additional included malicious DLLs are also loaded. The
payload is a custom malware loader that Microsoft tracks as YouieLoad. Similarly to SplitLoader, YouieLoad loads
malicious payloads in memory and creates malicious services that perform functions such as network and user
discovery and browser data collection. For compromised devices of particular interest to the group, the threat actor
launches hands-on-keyboard commands with further discovery and conducts credential theft.

Ransomware
RANSOMWARE AND EXTORTION
Learn how you can better protect your organization
4/10
In April 2024, Microsoft observed Moonstone Sleet delivering a new custom ransomware variant we have named
FakePenny against a company it previously compromised in February. FakePenny includes a loader and an
encryptor. Although North Korean threat actor groups have previously developed custom ransomware, this is the first
time we have observed this threat actor deploying ransomware.
Microsoft assesses that Moonstone Sleet’s objective in deploying the ransomware is financial gain, suggesting the
actor conducts cyber operations for both intelligence collection and revenue generation. Of note, the ransomware
note dropped by FakePenny closely overlaps with the note used by Seashell Blizzard in its malware NotPetya. The
ransom demand was $6.6M USD in BTC. This is in stark contrast to the lower ransom demands of previous North
Korea ransomware attacks, like WannaCry 2.0 and H0lyGh0st.

Fake companies
Since January 2024, Microsoft has observed Moonstone Sleet creating several fake companies impersonating
software development and IT services, typically relating to blockchain and AI. The actor has used these companies to
reach out to potential targets, using a combination of created websites and social media accounts to add legitimacy to
their campaigns.
StarGlow Ventures
From January to April 2024, Moonstone Sleet’s fake company StarGlow Ventures posed as a legitimate software
development company. The group used a custom domain, fake employee personas, and social media accounts, in an
email campaign targeting thousands of organizations in the education and software development sectors. In the
5/10
emails Moonstone Sleet sent as part of this campaign, the actor complimented the work of the targeted organization
and offered collaboration and support for upcoming projects, citing expertise in the development of web apps, mobile
apps, blockchain, and AI.
Figure 8. Example of an email from Moonstone Sleet’s StarGlow Ventures
campaign
These emails also contained a 1×1 tracking pixel, which likely enabled Moonstone Sleet to track which targets
engaged with the emails, and a link to a dummy unsubscribe page hosted on the StarGlow Ventures domain. While
the emails did not contain any malicious links, Microsoft assesses Moonstone Sleet likely used this campaign to
establish a relationship with target organizations. Although the purpose of these relationships is unclear, they may
afford the actor access to organizations of interest or be used as revenue generation opportunities. Microsoft notified
customers who were impacted by this Moonstone Sleet campaign.

website
C.C. Waterfall
In a similar campaign, Moonstone Sleet sent emails using its fake company C.C. Waterfall, a purported IT consulting
organization.
6/10
Figure 11. The landing page for C.C. Waterfall
In this campaign, Moonstone Sleet emailed higher education organizations, claiming the company was either hiring
new developers or looking for business collaboration opportunities. This campaign likely had similar goals to the
StarGlow Ventures campaign: to build relationships with organizations which could be leveraged for revenue
generation or malicious access.  
Figure 12. Example of an email from C.C. Waterfall
As previously mentioned, Moonstone Sleet also used C.C. Waterfall to contact targets and invite them to download
the actor’s tank game, highlighting that this is a coordinated and concerted effort for which Moonstone Sleet can
leverage multiple facets of its operations in overlapping campaigns.
Work-for-hire
In addition to creating fake companies, Microsoft has observed Moonstone Sleet pursuing employment in software
development positions at multiple legitimate companies. This activity could be consistent with previous reporting from
the United States Department of Justice that North Korea was using highly skilled remote IT workers to generate
revenue. On the other hand, this Moonstone Sleet activity may also be another approach to gaining access to
organizations.
Moonstone Sleet targets
Moonstone Sleet’s primary goals appear to be espionage and revenue generation. Targeted sectors to date include
both individuals and organizations in the software and information technology, education, and defense industrial base
sectors.
Software companies and developers
Since early January 2024, Moonstone Sleet has used the above fake software development companies to solicit work
or cooperation. This actor has also targeted individuals looking for work in software development, sending candidates
a “skills test” that instead delivers malware via a malicious NPM package.
Aerospace
In early December 2023, we observed Moonstone Sleet compromising a defense technology company to steal
credentials and intellectual property. In April 2024, the actor ransomed the organization using FakePenny. The same
month, we observed Moonstone Sleet compromise a company that makes drone technology. In May 2024, the threat
actor compromised a company that makes aircraft parts.
Fitting into the North Korean threat actor landscape
Sleet Actors
Read about North Korean threat actors
Moonstone Sleet’s diverse set of tactics is notable not only because of their effectiveness, but because of how they
have evolved from those of several other North Korean threat actors over many years of activity to meet North
Korean cyber objectives. For example, North Korea has for many years maintained a cadre of remote IT workers to
7/10
generate revenue in support of the country’s objectives. Moonstone Sleet’s pivot to conduct IT work within its
campaigns indicates it may not only be helping with this strategic initiative, but possibly also expanding the use of
remote IT workers beyond just financial gain. Additionally, Moonstone Sleet’s addition of ransomware to its playbook,
like another North Korean threat actor, Onyx Sleet, may suggest it is expanding its set of capabilities to enable
disruptive operations. Microsoft reported on Onyx Sleet’s and Storm-0530’s h0lyGhost ransomware in 2022.
Moonstone Sleet’s ability to conduct concurrent operations across multiple campaigns, the robustness of the
malicious game, and the use of a custom new ransomware variant are strong indications that this threat actor may be
well-resourced. Moreover, given that Moonstone Sleet’s initial attacks mirrored Diamond Sleet methodologies and
heavily reused Diamond Sleet’s code in their payloads, Microsoft assesses this actor is equipped with capabilities
from prior cyber operations conducted by other North Korean actors.
Microsoft has identified several techniques used by Moonstone Sleet that have previously been used by other North
Korean threat actors. For example, since late 2023, an actor that Microsoft tracks as Storm-1877 used malicious npm
packages in a campaign targeting software developers with JavaScript-based malware. This campaign was reported
publicly by PaloAlto as Contagious Interview. Additionally, in 2023, GitHub reported that Jade Sleet used malicious
npm packages in a campaign consisting of fake developer and recruiter personas that operated on LinkedIn, Slack,
and Telegram. This shared use of a relatively uncommon tactic across multiple distinct North Korean groups may
suggest sharing of expertise and TTPs among North Korean threat actors.
In recent months, Microsoft and other security researchers have reported on North Korean threat actors’ use of
software supply chain attacks to conduct widespread malicious operations. In November 2023, Microsoft reported on
Diamond Sleet’s supply chain compromise of CyberLink, a multimedia application. While Microsoft has not yet
identified any Moonstone Sleet supply chain attacks, the actor has extensively targeted software development firms
in its campaigns. Large-scale access to software companies would pose a particularly high risk for future supply
chain attacks against those organizations.
Moonstone Sleet’s appearance is an interesting development considering that North Korea has carried out a series of
changes in its foreign relations and security apparatus. In November 2023, North Korea closed embassies in several
countries, and in March 2024, may have dissolved the United Front Department (UFD), an agency believed to be
responsible for reunification and propaganda.
Despite being new, Moonstone Sleet has demonstrated that it will continue to mature, develop, and evolve, and has
positioned itself to be a preeminent threat actor conducting sophisticated attacks on behalf of the North Korean
regime.
Recommendations
Microsoft recommends the following mitigations defend against attacks by Moonstone Sleet:
Detect human-operated ransomware attacks with Microsoft Defender XDR. 
Enable controlled folder access. 
Ensure that tamper protection is enabled in Microsoft Dender for Endpoint. 
Enable network protection in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. 
Follow the credential hardening recommendations in our on-premises credential theft overview to defend
against common credential theft techniques like LSASS access.
Run endpoint detection and response (EDR) in block mode so that Microsoft Defender for Endpoint can block
malicious artifacts, even when your non-Microsoft antivirus does not detect the threat or when Microsoft
Defender Antivirus is running in passive mode. EDR in block mode works behind the scenes to remediate
malicious artifacts that are detected post-breach.    
Configure investigation and remediation in full automated mode to let Microsoft Defender for Endpoint take
immediate action on alerts to resolve breaches, significantly reducing alert volume. 
Turn on cloud-delivered protection in Microsoft Defender Antivirus, or the equivalent for your antivirus product,
to cover rapidly evolving attacker tools and techniques. Cloud-based machine learning protections block a
majority of new and unknown variants.
Microsoft Defender XDR customers can turn on the following attack surface reduction rule to prevent common attack
techniques used by Moonstone Sleet.
Block executable content from email client and webmail 
Block executable files from running unless they meet a prevalence, age, or trusted list criterion 
Use advanced protection against ransomware 
Block credential stealing from the Windows local security authority subsystem (lsass.exe)
