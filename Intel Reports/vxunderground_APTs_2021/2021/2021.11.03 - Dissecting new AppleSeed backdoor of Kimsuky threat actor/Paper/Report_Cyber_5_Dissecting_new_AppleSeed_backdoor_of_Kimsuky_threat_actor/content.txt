1 Introduction 
 
The Telsy Threat Intelligence team trackings various threat actors, among them the cyber 
espionage group known as Kimsuky, (aka: Velvet Chollima, Black Banshee and Thallium), 
which has been active since at least 2012 and is believed to be operating on behalf of the 
North Korean regime. The group has a rich and notorious history of offensive cyber 
operations around the world, including operations targeting South Korean think tanks, but 
over the past few years they have expanded their targeting to countries including the 
United States, Russia and various nations in Europe. Kimsuky uses various spearphishing 
and social engineering methods to obtain Initial Access to victim networks.  Spear-
phishing with a malicious attachment embedded in the email is the most observed 
Kimsuky tactic. 
The structure of the last dropped file (AppleSeed backdoor) and TTPs used in these recent 
activities align with what has been reported in Malwarebytes’s report ad exception of the 
communication method, that in this case is the public e-mail server "daum.net". 
In fact, this version of AppleSeed backdoor has several similarities with the one reported 
in the Malwarebytes report: 
§ it uses the same persistence method, creating the registry key named 
"EstsoftAutoUpdate"; 
§ the activation of the modules happens creating the following files, FolderMonitor, 
KeyboardMonitor, 
ScreenMonitor, 
UsbMonitor, 
in 
the 
directory 
"C:\ProgramData\Software\ESTsoft\Common\flags" with written inside "Flag"; 
§ uses RC4 for data encryption and decryption, the RC4 key is generated as an MD5 
hash of a randomly generated 117-byte buffer. The 117-byte buffer created is 
encrypted using the RSA algorithm and is sent to the sever along with the data 
encrypted with RC4. 
The use of a public mail server, as a communication method for Command and Control, 
was partially described by Securlist. In this version, analyzed by Telsy, there are some 
differences both in the way of sending and receiving mails, since the embedded library 
"Curl" is used and not the WinInet API, and in the functionality of receiving commands.

2 Analysis 
The 
analyzed 
sample 
is 
packed 
in 
UPX 
and 
has 
the 
following 
hash: 
8f268312a98c6cf69f2b9e6ba894b093eb9157f3. When it's unpacked the backdoor has the 
hash: a6d6fc43a7933cc5a4414ea076e1469074554de8. 
The exported main function of the sample, that is a PE DLL 64 bit, is named 
DllRegisterServer just like the multiple samples analysed in the past reports. The sample 
used as comparing term is an old AppleSeed backdoor belonging to the cluster that 
communicates 
with 
HTTP 
protocol 
having 
hash:  
576b953cb4fe71adb71a338a42524b0e424824c1. 
 
The strings embedded in the sample are encrypted with the same xor algorithm: 
key[i] ^ string[i-1] ^ string[i] 
where key are the first 32 bytes of the encrypted string taken unhexlified.

Below the evidence that the string encryption algorithm is the same. 
 
Just like the old sample the backdoor starts achieving persistence creating a new key 
registry named: ESTsoftAutoUpdate in  
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce 
with the following value:  
regsvr32.exe /s "C:\ProgramData\Software\ESTsoft\Common\ESTCommon.dll". 
Most likely the name wants to mime a library of the EDR product from the company 
ESTsecurity (estsecurity.com) that is a South Korean cyber security company. 
Moreover, it creates, in its base directory C:\ProgramData\Software\ESTsoft\Common, the 
following files and directories: 
§ cache – directory to contain files to send out via smtp; 
§ flags/FolderMonitor – if file exists the feature is enabled; 
§ flags/KeyboardMonitor - if file exists the feature is enabled; 
§ flags/ScreenMonitor - if file exists the feature is enabled; 
§ flags/UsbMonitor – if file exists the feature is enabled; 
§ list.fdb – file to contain list of files/directories to exfiltrate; 
§ ESTCommon.dll – library run through the register key.

The first difference found between the two samples is the mutex name, i.e. in the old 
AppleSeed sample the mutex name was: SpyRegsvr32-20210507140631, in the analysed 
sample the mutex name used is: SpyRegsvr32-20210602162710. The date could represent 
the compilation date of the backdoor. If the mutex already exists, the sample quits. 
 
 
Then the sample, checks if the key ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin is 0, the value allows to 
perform an operation that requires elevation without consent or credentials.

The check_keys()  returns 1 if the registry key has the expected value. 
 
Indeed, if the key is 0 and the process does not have the TokenElevation, then a powershell 
command is issued in order to restart the process with the good permissions. 
 
Even the check_keys() and is_tokenElevation_set() are very similar to the old AppleSeed 
sample.

If the registry key is set to 0 and the elevation token is already set for the process, than 
the sample adds the SeDebugPrivilege token to the process. 
 
Finally, the sample starts multiple threads that implements the main features of itself. 
In particular, the sample has 4 different features that are asynchronous, i.e. they are not 
triggered by the C2, and it has two threads the first one used to get commands from C2 
and another one for a new feature that were not implemented in the old AppleSeed 
backdoor. 
Below a difference between the features/thread run by the analysed sample on the left 
and the old sample on the right.

2.1 Communication 
Before digging inside the commands and features it’s required to understand the 
communication. Basically, the analysed sample differs from the old sample by the 
protocol employed communication, i.e., it uses SMTP/IMAP protocols to access to a mail-
server and download commands/upload exfiltrated information. 
The mail server access parameters used are the following: 
§ Username – k1-xomm@daum.net 
§ IMAP Server – imap.daum.net:993 
§ SMTP Server – smtp.daum.net:465 
The email sent with the exfiltrated data contain a specific pattern in the subject to 
distinguish between different types of attachments. The email sent/read from the 
backdoor does not have any body inside. 
Moreover, the attachments, that could be exfiltrated data or commands received are 
encrypted in a very paranoid way to keep secret the stolen documents in the case the 
email and password were identified. 
 
2.1.1 Attachment Sent/Command Read Encryption  
Even though the communication protocol changes, the encryption algorithm is the same 
seen in the old AppleSeed sample. 
Every attachment type before of sent or read from mail server has the same encryption 
algorithm, that can be resumed below. 
Cyber Reports – 03/11/2021 
 
 
Telsy Report – Dissecting new AppleSeed backdoor of Kimsuky threat actor © Telsy 2021

All the attachments to send are first compressed in zip and then they are encrypted. 
The encryption algorithm could be divided in two main stages, in the first stage a 117 bytes 
buffer is randomly generated and the MD5 hash of them is used to encrypt with RC4 
algorithm the plain attachment. So the first output will consist of the len of the plain 
attachment, the 117 random bytes encrypted with an RSA Public Key and the attachment 
encrypted with RC4 algorithm. 
Cyber Reports – 03/11/2021 
 
 
Telsy Report – Dissecting new AppleSeed backdoor of Kimsuky threat actor © Telsy 2021 
11 
 
In this way, the RSA private key is required in order to decrypt the first stage output file.                  
In the second stage, the first stage output file is encrypted using a basic xor algorithm.                   
The xor key is long 16 bytes and it is randomly generated every time. The output file is 
composed in the following way. 
OFFSET 
VALUE 
PURPOSE 
0 
%PDF-1.7..4 0 obj 
Fake PDF header 
17 
<CRC(xor key, data encrypted with 
xor)> 
Custom Sarwate algorithm over the generated 
xor key and the xor-encrypted data. 
21 
XOR key  
Xor key, randomly generated, used to encrypt the 
first stage encryption output. 
37 
Encrypted Payload 
Final Encrypted Payload after XOR operation 
 
The custom Sarwate CRC, is calculated over the generated key and the data obtained after 
the xor encryption and at the end final CRC is negated and stored in the file..  The lookup 
table is, of course, fixed and it is every time generated. 
Cyber Reports – 03/11/2021 
 
 
Telsy Report – Dissecting new AppleSeed backdoor of Kimsuky threat actor © Telsy 2021 
12 
 
Basically, the initial condition of the CRC is the value 0xffffffff, then it is updated processing 
the Sarwate Algorithm over the xor key. 
 
 
The described encryption method is the same used by the threat actor to put commands 
on the mail server, so basically the backdoor contains an RSA public key to encrypt data 
to be sent and an RSA private key to decrypt commands stored on the mail server as email. 
Cyber Reports – 03/11/2021 
 
 
Telsy Report – Dissecting new AppleSeed backdoor of Kimsuky threat actor © Telsy 2021 
13 
The keys are stored in Microsoft Blob format, of course the keys are not part of the same 
pair. 
 
 
The files produced after the first encryption stage have the following name  
filename.extension>.enc and after the second stage they have the name of: 
<filename.extension>.tmp. 
 
2.1.2 Communication Implementation 
The communication with the mail server is achieved using libcurl version 7.70 embedded 
in the code.  Indeed, building libcurl and to do a bindiff it is easy to find main APIs.  
 
2.1.3 SCREENSHOOT Feature 
The screenshot thread is equal to the one used in the old samples, i.e., it takes a 
screenshot every 5 minutes and then it is sent to the C2 using smtp protocol. 
Cyber Reports – 03/11/2021 
 
 
Telsy Report – Dissecting new AppleSeed backdoor of Kimsuky threat actor © Telsy 2021 
14 
 
The screenshot are stored in C:\ProgramData\temp\<tempfilename>.tmp and after the 
full encryption algorithm, the filename changes, as said, to 
C:\ProgramData\temp\<tempfilename>.tmp.tmp. 
 
2.1.4 KEYLOGGER Feature 
This feature is used to take the keystroke with the window name. 
 
This feature does not change from the old sample indeed it logs 256 keystrokes and writes 
them to the file. Then it sleeps for a millisecond and every ~10 minutes it sends out the 
log file.

Telsy Report – Dissecting new AppleSeed backdoor of Kimsuky threat actor © Telsy 2021 
15 
2.1.5 Folder Monitor 
This feature, like the old AppleSeed sample, is used to search and send out the documents 
every minute and in particular it searches for documents in specific directories like: 
§ Documents 
§ Desktop 
§ Downloads 
§ AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\INetCache\IE 
The documents file searched are doc, txt, ppt, hwp and pdf. 
 
 
2.1.6 USB Monitor 
Monitor external drives every minute, when found one it executes the dir command in 
order to get the file tree of the drive self, i.e. “cmd /c dir <drive>:\ /s” and sends back the 
result of the command. Also this features is equals to the old AppleSeed backdoor. 
 
 
2.1.7 PING Messages 
This feature is used like a ping message, indeed every ~10 minutes the backdoor sends 
out a message containing as body encoded in base64 the following string: 
<date>\n<VolumeDriveID>\nWin<MajorVer>.<MinorVer>.<Build>x64\nD_Regsvr32\nv2.0\
n34 
 
Cyber Reports – 03/11/2021 
 
 
Telsy Report – Dissecting new AppleSeed backdoor of Kimsuky threat actor © Telsy 2021 
16 
 
This message is the only one sent out in plain text. 
 
 
2.1.8 LIST FDB Monitor 
This feature is not implemented in the old AppleSeed sample. It is used to exfiltrate 
specific directories or file from the infected system. Moreover, this feature is synchronous, 
i.e., it is triggered by the commands read from the server. 
The file C:\ProgramData\Software\ESTsoft\Common\list.fdb has the following format: 
VALUE 
PURPOSE 
0xfeff 
Custom Magic of the file 
<file1|dir1>\r\n 
A filename with path or a 
directory. 
<file2|dir2>\r\n 
A filename with path or a 
directory. 
<file-nth|dir-nth>\r\n 
A filename with path or a 
directory. 
 
The thread just read the file and checks for the right magic. 
Cyber Reports – 03/11/2021 
 
 
Telsy Report – Dissecting new AppleSeed backdoor of Kimsuky threat actor © Telsy 2021 
17 
 
 
 
Then, it zips encrypted every file/directory listed in the file and sends it to the C2. 
 
After that every file/directory has been exfiltrated, the list.fdb file is cleaned, removing all 
the files/directories written in it and leaving inside only the magic. 
 
2.2 Commands read From Mail Server 
The mail server acts as a container for both ex-filtered data and commands to be sent by 
email. Commands are originated by a secondary C2 and stored in a specific directory of 
the mail account in the form of an email without a body but with an encrypted attachment 
containing the command to be given to the backdoor. 
At code/requests level the command is read using the following calls at every 30 seconds: 
§ Read all the UID from the mail server in the “cmd” folder

§ The attachment is read from the message, stored in a temporary file, deserialized 
and parsed. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
§ The email, containing the command to be executed, after being read is deleted 
from the mail server using the following http request with POST method:  
imaps://imap.daum.net:993/cmd;UID=<uid> passing as parameter: STORE 1 +Flags 
\\Deleted.

2.2.1 Command Read Format 
The command originated by the threat actor is encrypted in the same way as the 
exfiltrated data. The backdoor is set up to receive different commands, so a unique 
structure has been implemented for any command received.  
Below is the structure of the attachment to the e-mail containing the commands to be 
executed: 
Offset

Purpose 
0 
CommandID

Of course, there could be more than two parameters therefore, during the parsing, the 
command is deserialized and stored in a data structure like the following: 
 
 
The supported commands are the following:
