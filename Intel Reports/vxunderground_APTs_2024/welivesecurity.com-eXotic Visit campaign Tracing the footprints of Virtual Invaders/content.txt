eXotic Visit campaign: Tracing the footprints of Virtual Invaders
ESET researchers uncovered the eXotic Visit espionage campaign that targets users mainly in India and Pakistan
with seemingly innocuous apps

ESET researchers have discovered an active espionage campaign targeting Android users with apps primarily posing
as messaging services. While these apps offer functional services as bait, they are bundled with open-source
XploitSPY malware. We have named this campaign eXotic Visit and have tracked its activities from November 2021
through to the end of 2023. The targeted campaign has been distributing malicious Android apps through dedicated
websites and, for some time, through the Google Play store as well. Because of the targeted nature of the campaign,
the apps available on Google Play had a low number of installs; all of them have been removed from the store. The
eXotic Visit campaign appears to primarily target a select group of Android users in Pakistan and India. There is no
indication that this campaign is linked to any known group; however, we are tracking the threat actors behind it under
the moniker Virtual Invaders.
Key points of the report:
This active and targeted Android espionage campaign, which we have named eXotic Visit, started
in late 2021 and mainly impersonates messaging apps that are distributed through dedicated
websites and Google Play.
Overall, at the time of writing, around 380 victims have downloaded the apps from both sources
and created accounts to use their messaging functionality. Because of the targeted nature of the
campaign, the number of installs of each app from Google Play is relatively low – between zero and
45.
Downloaded apps provide legitimate functionality, but also include code from the open-source
Android RAT XploitSPY. We have linked the samples through their use of the same C&C, unique
and custom malicious code updates, and the same C&C admin panel.
Throughout the years, these threat actors have customized their malicious code by adding
obfuscation, emulator detection, hiding of C&C addresses, and use of a native library.
The region of interest seems to be South Asia; in particular, victims in Pakistan and India have
been targeted.
Currently, ESET Research does not have enough evidence to attribute this activity to any known
threat group; we track the group internally as Virtual Invaders.
Apps that contain XploitSPY can extract contact lists and files, get the device’s GPS location and the names of files
listed in specific directories related to the camera, downloads, and various messaging apps such as Telegram and
WhatsApp. If certain filenames are identified as being of interest, they can subsequently be extracted from these
directories via an additional command from the command and control (C&C) server. Interestingly, the implementation
2/14
of the chat functionality integrated with XploitSPY is unique; we strongly believe that this chat function was developed
by the Virtual Invaders group.
The malware also uses a native library, which is often used in Android app development for improving performance
and accessing system features. However, in this case, the library is used to hide sensitive information, like the
addresses of the C&C servers, making it harder for security tools to analyze the app.
The apps described in the sections below were taken down from Google Play; moreover, as a Google App Defense
Alliance partner, ESET identified ten additional apps that contain code that is based on XploitSPY and shared its
findings with Google. Following our alert, the apps were removed from the store. Each of the apps described below
had a low number of installs, suggesting a targeted approach rather than a broad strategy. The Timeline of eXotic
Visit apps section below describes the “fake”, albeit functional, apps we have identified as part of this campaign,
whereas the Technical analysis section focuses on the details of the XploitSPY code, present in various incarnations
across those apps.
Timeline of eXotic Visit apps
Starting chronologically, on January 12th, 2022, MalwareHunterTeam shared a tweet with a hash and a link to a
website that distributes an app named WeTalk, which impersonates the popular Chinese WeChat application. The
website provided a link to a GitHub project to download a malicious Android app. Based on the date available on
GitHub, the wetalk.apk app was uploaded in December 2021.
At that time, there were five apps available, using the names ChitChat.apk, LearnSindhi.apk, SafeChat.apk,
wechat.apk, and wetalk.apk. The ChitChat app had been available on GitHub since November 2021, distributed using
a dedicated website (chitchat.ngrok[.]io; see Figure 1) as well as the malicious WeTalk app mentioned earlier. Both
use the same C&C address with the admin panel login interface shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2. Admin panel login page for the WeTalk and ChitChat C&C server
3/14
Since July 2023, the same GitHub account has hosted new malicious Android apps that have the same malicious
code and C&C server. We don’t have any information on how these apps are distributed. Apps are stored in five
repositories, using names such as ichat.apk, MyAlbums.apk, PersonalMessenger.apk, Photo Collage Grid & Pic
Maker.apk, Pics.apk, PrivateChat.apk, SimInfo.apk, Specialist Hospital.apk, Spotify_ Music and Podcasts.apk,
TalkUChat.apk, and Themes for Android.apk.
Returning to ChitChat.apk and wetalk.apk: both apps contain the promised messaging functionality, but also include
malicious code we have identified as the open-source XploitSPY available on GitHub. XploitSPY is based on another
open-source Android RAT called L3MON; however, it was removed from GitHub by its author. L3MON was inspired
by yet another open-source Android RAT named AhMyth, with extended functionality (we covered another AhMyth-
derived Android RAT in this WeLiveSecurity blogpost).
Espionage and remote control of the targeted device are the main purposes of the app. Its malicious code is capable
of:
listing files on the device,
sending SMS messages,
obtaining call logs, contacts, text messages, and a list of installed apps,
getting a list of surrounding Wi-Fi networks, device location, and user accounts,
taking pictures using the camera,
recording audio from the device’s surroundings, and
intercepting notifications received for WhatsApp, Signal, and any other notification that contains the string new
messages.
The last function might be a lazy attempt to intercept received messages from any messaging app.
The same C&C address that was used by previously mentioned apps (wechat.apk and ChitChat.apk) is also used by
Dink Messenger. Based on VirusTotal’s in-the-wild URLs, this sample was available for download from
letchitchat[.]info on February 24th, 2022. That domain was registered on January 28th, 2022. On top of messaging
functionality, the attackers added malicious code based on XploitSPY.
On November 8th, 2022, MalwareHunterTeam tweeted a hash of the malicious Android alphachat.apk app with its
download website. The app was available for download on the same domain as the Dink Messenger app
(letchitchat[.]info). The Alpha Chat app uses the same C&C server and C&C admin panel login page as in Figure 2,
but on a different port; the app also contains the same malicious code. We don’t have information about when Dink
Messenger was available on the domain; subsequently, it was replaced by Alpha Chat.
The trojanized Alpha Chat app, compared to previous versions of XploitSPY from the eXotic Visit campaign, contains
a malicious code update that includes emulator detection. If this app detects that it is running in an emulator, then it
uses a fake C&C address instead of revealing the real one, as shown in Figure 3. This should most likely prevent
automated malware sandboxes, while performing dynamic analysis, from identifying the actual C&C server.
Figure 3. Emulator detection
Alpha Chat also uses an additional C&C address to exfiltrate non-image files with a size over 2 MB. Other files are
 exfiltrated via a web socket to the C&C server.
That is a connection between the Dink Messenger and Alpha Chat apps: both were distributed on the same
dedicated website. However, Dink Messenger was also carefully distributed through the Google Play store: Version
1.0 of Dink Messenger appeared on Google Play on February 8th, 2022, but with no malicious functionality included.
This might have been a test by the threat actor to see whether the app would be validated and successfully uploaded
to the store. On May 24th, 2022, version 1.2 was uploaded, still without malicious functionality. At that time the app
was installed over 15 times. On June 10th, 2022, version 1.3 was uploaded to Google Play. This version contained
malicious code, as shown in Figure 4.
4/14
Figure 4. Class name comparison of Dink Messenger without malicious functionality (left) and with
(right)
Subsequently, three more versions were uploaded to Google Play with the same malicious code; the last, version 1.6,
was uploaded on December 15th, 2022. All in all, these six versions have over 40 installs. We have no information on
when the app was removed from the store. All the app versions with and without malicious code were signed by the
same developer certificate, which means they were built and pushed to Google Play by the same malicious
developer.
It is also important to mention that the Dink Messenger app available on letchitchat[.]info used the same C&C server
as the Dink Messenger app on Google Play, and could perform extended malicious actions; however, the user
interface of each was different (see Figure 5). Dink Messenger on Google Play implemented emulator checks (just as
Alpha Chat), whereas the one on the dedicated website did not.
Figure 5. User interface of Dink Messenger downloaded from a dedicated website (left) and Google Play (right)

On August 15th, 2022, the Telco DB app (with the package name com.infinitetechnology.telcodb), which claims to
provide information about the owners of phone numbers, was uploaded to an alternative app store; see Figure 6. This
app has the same malicious code, a newly added emulator check with fake C&C address redirection, and an
additional C&C server for file exfiltration. The C&C address is not hardcoded, as in previous cases; rather, it is
returned from a Firebase server. We believe that this is another trick to hide the real C&C server, and perhaps even
to update it in the future. With a high level of confidence, we assess that this app is a part of the eXotic Visit
campaign.
Figure 6. User interface of the Telco DB app
Four days later, on August 19th, 2022, the Sim Info app was uploaded to Google Play as part of the campaign. It also
claims to provide the user with information about who owns a phone number.
The malicious code communicates with the same C&C server as previous samples and is otherwise the same except
that the threat actors included a native library. We elaborate on this native library in the Toolset section. Sim Info
reached over 30 installs on Google Play; we have no information about when it was removed from the store.
On June 21st, 2023, the malicious Defcom app was uploaded to Google Play; see Figure 7.
6/14
Figure 7. Defcom messaging app on Google Play
Defcom is a trojanized messaging app that is part of the eXotic Visit campaign, using the same malicious code and
native library to retrieve its C&C server. It uses a new C&C server, but with the same admin panel login interface
shown in Figure 2. This C&C domain (zee.xylonn[.]com) was registered on June 2nd, 2023.
Before the app was removed, sometime in June 2023, it reached around six installs on Google Play.
In Figure 8, we illustrate a timeline of when all the apps were first available for download as part of the campaign.
Figure 8. Timeline of the first appearance of XploitSPY-riddled apps that are part of the malicious campaign
Besides the already mentioned malicious apps that are part of the campaign, we were able to identify additional apps
were uploaded to Google Play, and others where an attempt was made to upload, but we're unable to tell whether the
uploads were successful. Although we identified them based on the same detection names, we were not able to
obtain the samples to analyze them and verify whether they are part of the same campaign. In any case, they contain
malicious code that is based on XploitSPY. Table 1 list XploitSPY apps that were available on Google Play. Each of
these apps had a low number of installs. A substantial number of the apps that were available on Google Play had
zero installs, with some yielding under 10 installs. The highest install count from the Play Store came in at under 45.

ESET is a member of the App Defense Alliance and an active partner in the malware mitigation program, which aims
to quickly find Potentially Harmful Applications (PHAs) and stop them before they ever make it onto Google Play.
As a Google App Defense Alliance partner, ESET identified all mentioned apps as malicious and shared its findings
with Google, who subsequently unpublished them. All the apps identified in the report that were on Google Play are
no longer available on the Play store.
Victimology
Our research indicates that malicious apps developed by eXotic Visit were distributed through Google Play and
dedicated websites, and four of those apps mostly targeted users in Pakistan and India. We detected one of those
four apps, Sim Info, on an Android device in Ukraine, but we don’t think Ukraine is being targeted specifically, as the
app was available on Google Play for anyone to download. Based on our data, each of the malicious apps available
on Google Play was downloaded tens of times; however, we don’t have any visibility into the download details.
We identified potential targets for four of these apps: Sim Info, Telco DB (com.infinitetechnology.telcodb), Shah jee
Foods, and Specialist Hospital.
The Sim Info and Telco DB apps provide users the functionality to search for SIM owner information for any Pakistani
mobile number, using the online service dbcenteruk.com; see Figure 9.

On July 8th, 2022, an app named Shah jee Foods was uploaded to VirusTotal from Pakistan. This app is part of the
campaign. After startup, it displays a food ordering website for the Pakistan region, foodpanda.pk.
The Specialist Hospital app, available on GitHub, poses as the app for Specialist Hospital in India
(specialisthospital.in); see Figure 10. After starting, the app requests the permissions necessary to perform its
malicious activities and then requests user to install the legitimate app from Google Play.

We were able to find over 380 compromised accounts created in some of these apps; however, we were not able to
retrieve their geolocation. Since the same insecure code was found in ten apps, we can say with a high level of
confidence that they were developed by the same threat actor.
Attribution
We track this operation, active since the end of 2021, as eXotic Visit, but based on ESET research and that of others,
we cannot attribute this campaign to any known group. As a result, we have internally labeled the group behind this
operation as Virtual Invaders.
XploitSPY is widely available and customized versions have been used by multiple threat actors such as the
Transparent Tribe APT group, as documented by Meta. However, the modifications found in the apps we describe as
part of the eXotic Visit campaign are distinctive and differ from those in previously documented variants of the
XploitSPY malware.
Technical analysis
Initial access
Initial access to the device is gained by tricking a potential victim into installing a fake, but functional, app. As
described in the Timeline of eXotic Visit apps section, the malicious ChitChat and WeTalk apps were distributed via
dedicated websites (chitchat.ngrok[.]io and wetalk.ngrok[.]io, respectively), and hosted on GitHub
(https://github[.]com/Sojal87/).
At that time, three more apps – LearnSindhi.apk, SafeChat.apk, and wechat.apk – were available from the same
GitHub account; we are not aware of their distribution vector. As of July 2023, these apps were not available for
download from their GitHub repositories anymore. However, the same GitHub account now hosts several new
malicious apps available for download. All of these new apps are also part of the malicious eXotic Visit espionage
campaign, due to also containing variants of the same XploitSPY code.
The Dink Messenger and Alpha Chat apps were hosted on a dedicated website (letchitchat[.]info), from which victims
were enticed into downloading and installing the app.
The Dink Messenger, Sim Info, and Defcom apps had been available on Google Play until their removal by Google.
10/14
Toolset
All analyzed apps contain customizations of the code from the malicious XploitSPY app available on GitHub. Since
the first version found in 2021 until the latest version, first distributed in July 2023, we have seen continuing
development efforts. Virtual Invaders has included:
usage of a fake C&C server if an emulator is detected,
code obfuscation,
an attempt to hide the C&C addresses from static analysis by retrieving it from its Firebase server, and
use of a native library that keeps the C&C server and other information encoded and hidden from static
analysis tools.
What follows is our analysis of custom XploitSPY malware that, in the Defcom app, was available on Google Play.
Defcom integrates XploitSPY code with a unique chat functionality; we believe with high level of confidence the chat
functionality was created by Virtual Invaders. This applies to all of the other messaging apps that have XploitSPY
included.
After its initial start, the app prompts users to create an account and simultaneously attempts to obtain device location
details by querying api.ipgeolocation.io and forwarding the result to a Firebase server. This server also functions as
the messaging component’s server. The app interface is shown in Figure 11.
Figure 11. Defcom’s login interface (left) and in-app tabs (right)
Defcom utilizes a native library, often used in Android app development for performance enhancement and system
feature access. Written in C or C++, these libraries can be used to conceal malicious functionalities. Defcom’s native
library is named defcome-lib.so.
defcome-lib.so’s purpose is to hide sensitive information such as C&C servers from static app analysis. Methods
implemented in the library return a base64-encoded string that is then decoded by the malicious code during runtime.
This technique isn’t very sophisticated, but it prevents static analysis tools from extracting C&C servers. Figure 12
shows the native method declarations in the Java code, and Figure 13 the implementation of the getServerUrl
method in assembly code. Note that the comment above each declaration in Figure 12 is the decoded return value
when calling that method.
11/14
Figure 12. Native method declarations
Figure 13. Implementation of the native method getServerUrl in assembly language
The commands to execute on the compromised device are returned from the C&C server. Each command is
represented by a string value. The list of the commands is:
0xCO – Get contact list.
0xDA – Exfiltrate file from device. The path to the file is received from the C&C server.
0xFI – List files in the directory specified by the server. With an additional argument it can upload files from a
specified directory to the C&C server.
0xIP – Get device geolocation using the ipgeolocation.io service.
0xLO – Get device GPS location.
0xOF – List files in seven specific directories. In four cases the file paths are hardcoded, in three cases only
folder names. An additional argument specifies the directory:
0xCA – Camera
0xDW – Downloads
0xSS – /storage/emulated/0/Pictures/Screenshots
0xTE – Telegram
0xWB – /storage/emulated/0/Android/media/com.whatsapp.w4b/WhatsApp Business/Media
0xWG – /storage/emulated/0/Android/media/com.gbwhatsapp/GBWhatsApp/Media
0xWP – /storage/emulated/0/Android/media/com.whatsapp/WhatsApp/Media
Interestingly, GB WhatsApp is an unofficial cloned version of WhatsApp. While it offers additional features that have
made it quite popular, it is important to note that it’s not available on Google Play. Instead, it is often found on various
12/14
download websites, where versions of it are frequently riddled with malware. The app has a substantial user base in
several countries, including India, despite its associated security risks.
Figure 14 and Figure 15 show the exfiltration of a contact list and a directory listing.
Figure 14. Contact list exfiltration
Figure 15. File list exfiltration
Network infrastructure
Virtual Invaders use ngrok as its C&C server; the service is a cross-platform application that enables developers to
expose a local development server to the internet. ngrok can create a tunnel that connects using ngrok servers to a
local machine. ngrok allows its users – so, the attackers in this case – to reserve a particular IP address or redirect
the victim to the attacker’s own domain on a specific port.
Conclusion
We have described the eXotic Visit campaign, operated by the Virtual Invaders threat actor, which has been active
since at least the end of 2021. Throughout the years the campaign has evolved. Distribution started on dedicated
websites and then even moved to the official Google Play store.
We have identified the malicious code used as a customized version of the open-source Android RAT, XploitSPY. It is
bundled with legitimate app functionality, most of the time being a fake, but functioning, messaging application. The
campaign has evolved over the years to include obfuscation, emulator detection, and hiding of C&C addresses. The
purpose of the campaign is espionage and probably is targeting victims in Pakistan and India.
