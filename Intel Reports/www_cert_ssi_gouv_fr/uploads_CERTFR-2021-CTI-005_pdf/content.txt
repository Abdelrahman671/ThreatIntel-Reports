Sandworm intrusion set campaign targeting Centreon systems
Summary
ANSSI has been informed of an intrusion campaign targeting the monitoring software Centreon distributed by the
french company CENTREON which resulted in the breach of several French entities.
The ﬁrst victim seems to have been compromised from late 2017. The campaign lasted until 2020.
This campaign mostly affected information technology providers, especially web hosting providers.
On compromised systems, ANSSI discovered the presence of a backdoor in the form of a webshell dropped on sev-
eral Centreon servers exposed to the internet. This backdoor was identiﬁed as being the P.A.S. webshell, version
number 3.1.4. On the same servers, ANSSI found another backdoor identical to one described by ESET and named
Exaramel [1].
This campaign bears several similarities with previous campaigns attributed to the intrusion set named Sandworm.
This report provides technical information detailing this campaign: targeted systems (Section 1), detailed malwares
code analysis (Section 2), infrastructure (Section 3), tactics, techniques, and procedures (Section 4) and link with
the intrusion set Sandworm (Section 4). Recommandations (Section 6) and detection methods (Section 7) are sug-
gested to better protect against this kind of attack and remediate eventual compromissions.

Sandworm intrusion set campaign targeting Centreon systems
1 Targeted systems
Centreon is a software developed by a company of the same name. Its purpose is to monitor applications, networks
and systems. An open-source version exists under the GPL 2.0 licence. The editor-issued virtual image is based on
the CENTOS operating system. However, it is also available on other LINUX operating systems.
The simpliﬁed software architecture is divided between a monitoring core named Centreon Engine and a graphical
user interface named Centreon Web UI [2]. The default installation settings use the APACHE server and serve the
interface on the URL http://<IP>/centreon.
Compromised servers identiﬁed by ANSSI ran the CENTOS operating system. Centreon had not recently been up-
dated. The most recent installation version studied by ANSSI was 2.5.2.
The initial compromise method is not known.
2 Malwares
2.1 Webshell P.A.S. 3.1.4
2.1.1 Context on the webshell
The P.A.S. webshell was developed by an ukrainian student, Jaroslav Volodimirovich Panchenko, who used the nick-
name Profexer [3][4]. It was developed in PHP and features a characteristic password-based encryption [5]. This tool
was available through a form on his website, where a user had to provide a password to receive a custom webshell.
The form suggested a donation to the developer. It was commonly used, including during a WORDPRESS website
attack [6] [7].
In december 2016, the DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY published a report known as Grizzly Steppe [8] that
presented tools, techniques and infrastructure used during various attacks on the 2016 U.S. elections. Its appendix
features a webshell that the DHS named Fobushell, an alternate name for the P.A.S. webshell.
Some webshells included in the Grizzly Steppe report [8] used the version numbers 3.0.10 and 3.1.0. Their passwords
were root, avto, 123123, we kome and |F3Jk 6k6. The report does not mention the versions and passwords for
several samples.
Following the report, the developer stopped its webshell generation service and contacted the U.S. authorities [3].
The last known version of this webshell was the 4.1.1. However, many samples of this webshell remain publicly
available.
2.1.2 Webshell upload
Centreon servers analysed by ANSSI analysed presented several illegitimate PHP ﬁles. Further analysis allowed
their identiﬁcation as versions of the P.A.S. webshell, the source code displaying the version number 3.1.4. They
could be found at the following paths:
• /usr/local/centreon/www/search.php
• /usr/share/centreon/www/search.php
• /usr/share/centreon/www/modules/Discovery/include/DB−Drop.php
The ﬁrst ﬁles were thus reachable through internet using the URL http://<IP>/centreon/search.php.

Commentary: Even though the 3.1.4 version does not seem to be publicly available, it is still easy to modify the webshell
source code. For example, it is possible to trivially alter the password or the version number.
Another illegitimate PHP ﬁle was identiﬁed at the path /usr/share/centreon/www/htmlHeader.php. This ﬁle was
deleted before ANSSI could recover and analyse it.
On all servers analysed by ANSSI, webshell-related ﬁles were created by the apache user.

2.1.3.1 Webshell encryption
One of the distinctive characteristics of the malware is the use of a speciﬁc encryption layer to both conceal its
internals from scrutiny and enforce an access control when deployed on a compromised host. This mechanism,
previously documented by Trustwave [5], will be quickly reviewed thereafter.
The webshell PHP ﬁle is composed of two main parts:
• the encrypted and base64 encoded core functionalities to be executed once activated and compressed;
• a form backed by the decryption mechanism to process the password supplied by the operator. The code
snippet below shows a formatted and deobfuscated version of this part of the webshell.

$_COOKIE['password']:NULL);

}

The decryption logic can be described as follows.
• The webshell data is ﬁrst base64 decoded;
• the password is received via the login form, depicted in ﬁgure 2.1, through a POST parameter variable or in a
cookie if the login phase has already happened.
Fig. 2.1: P.A.S. login page
Commentary: The name of the variable used to convey the password changes in the different versions of the webshell.
However it mainly follows the same structure in available samples. The one deﬁned in our case is g__g_. Other
ones extracted from available P.A.S. samples include l___l_, _f___f or wp__wp.
• A decryption keystream buffer is built using the MD5 hash of the password, concatenated with a second value
based on the MD5 hash computed from the password in reverse order and truncated to the length of the pass-
word.

• The program then enters a loop where for each iteration a character from the decryption key buffer is sub-
tracted from a byte of the encrypted webshell. The result is both used as the decrypted data and appended
to the key buffer, thus building the keystream on the ﬂy.
• At the end, the decrypted buffer is passed to PHP’s gzinflate function in order to uncompress it.

• At that point, if the buffer decryption was correct, the inﬂate action should succeed and the newly available
code run. If it is not already the case, i.e. if it is the initial connection, the password is set in a cookie for future
use.
2.1.3.2 Functionalities
The webshell has several functionalities grouped by categories within sub-menus accessible from the interface’s
navigation bar. The malware is built on a main view which is updated to reﬂect navigation choices whenever a sub-
function webshell is started. The different choices will be discussed below. As a global overview, each function of
the webshell is built upon a form that seeks to get the task parameters before running it, then update the interface
in order to display the results.
Commentary: The ﬁeld names for these forms are statically deﬁned by the webshell code. Several detection strategies are
detailed in the appendix.
Explorer Menu
The ﬁrst webshell menu regroups ﬁle handling tasks. It offers the following actions:
• list ﬁles and several of their characteristics such as extension, ﬁle size, ownership or permissions;
• interact with a ﬁle to to move, copy, delete or download it;
• rename a ﬁle;
• create a new ﬁle or modify an already existing ﬁle;
• upload a ﬁle on the compromised host.

When editing a ﬁle, it is possible to:
• change its permissions;
• change its group;
• change its last modiﬁcation date.
Regarding the last options, if the ﬁle does exists, by default the last modiﬁcation date is set to the original ﬁle last
modiﬁcation date. If not, the webshell uses the last modiﬁcation date of the folder.

Searcher Menu
The webshell has a function enabling the search of speciﬁc elements within the ﬁle tree of the compromised host’s
ﬁle system. This search can be set within a speciﬁc path with the following parameters:
• the properties of the elements (read/write access or all);
• the nature of the searched element (folder, ﬁle or all);
• a pattern to match within the element name supporting wildcard characters * and ?;
• a character chain appearing in the content of the targeted ﬁle.
Fig. 2.6: Search menu of P.A.S.
SQL-client menu
The webshell P.A.S. can interact with SQL databases. The matching interface represented in ﬁgure 2.7 is divided in
three parts.
• The top panel is used to deﬁne database connexion parameters. The malware SQL client can use three database
formats: MySQL, MSSQL and PostgreSQL.
• The left part lists accessible databases and tables.
• The central part lists the database contents and the query that was used.

Other than database navigation, the malware can also to extract the content of the database in order to get a local
copy.
Network Tools Menu
From this menu, the P.A.S. webshell can perform three distinct network tasks:
• create a bind shell with a listening port;
• create a reverse shell with a distant address as a parameter;
• run a network scan in order to ﬁnd open ports and listening services on a machine.
The webshell creates distant shell with PERL scripts. These scripts are run using code snippets completed with ade-
quate parameters and assembled to form the ﬁnal script. Its ﬁle is stored in a sub-folder of /tmp/ and is be deleted
after being run with unlink.
Passwd BruteForce Menu
The P.A.S. webshell has a brute force password attack function against six services: SSH, FTP, POP3, MySQL, MSSQL
and PostgreSQL. This function can be run by selecting one or more services, as well as predeﬁned user/passwords
as presented in ﬁgure 2.8.
Fig. 2.8: Passwd BruteForce menu interface
CMD Menu
The CMD menu is a minimalistic interface allowing the execution of a command or the evaluation of a PHP expression.
Server info Menu
The last P.A.S. menu has two preset actions enabling the quick collection of informations on the compromised host.
The ﬁrst will run the command phpinfo to list PHP server conﬁguration details. The second action, available only
for LINUX systems, allows to display the /etc/passwd ﬁle.

2.2 Exaramel backdoor
Exaramel is a backdoor ﬁrst publicly reported by ESET in 2018 [1]. Two samples were identiﬁed, one targeting the
WINDOWS operating system and the other targeting LINUX operating systems. A sample of the LINUX version was
uploaded to VIRUSTOTAL in october 2019, as stated by ESET researcher Anton Cherepanov [9]. This sample hashes
are as follows:

2.2.1 Installation
ANSSI’s investigation allowed to identify the use of Linux/Exaramel for multiple victims of this campaign.
The backdoor’s name is centreon_module_linux_app64. It has been found in the Centreon server folder, either
at /usr/share/centreon/www/ or at /usr/local/centreon/www/modules/.
In the same folder, several other ﬁles have been found including a script named respawner.sh, conﬁguration ﬁles
config.json and configtx.json, as well as several ﬁles named with a number followed by the .rep extension.
Their role is detailed further down in this analysis.
Logs indicating daily execution of respawner.sh by CRON were observed from november 2017 to february 2018.
Its content could not be retrieved, its role is thus unknown.
All Linux/Exaramel-related ﬁles analysed by ANSSI were created by the apache user.
Analysis performed by ANSSI did not allow to identify the origin of the backdoor binary.
2.2.2 Analysis
For this analysis, Linux/Exaramel will simply be referred as Exaramel.
Exaramel is written in GO. Its source code length is approximately 1400 lines. It is divided in 5 packages: main,
worker, configur, scheduler and networker. Besides GO standard library, Exaramel uses two publicly-available
third-party packages.
• github.com/robfig/cron
• github.com/satori/go.uuid
This analysis uses the following sample:

2.2.2.3 Operation overview
Exaramel is a remote administration tool supporting a limited set of tasks, including: ﬁle copy from Command
and Control server to Exaramel host, ﬁle copy from host to Command and Control server and shell command exe-
cution. Exaramel communicates using HTTPS with its Command and Control server in order to get the list of tasks
it is supposed to run. Exaramel persists on the system using different methods.
Exaramel execution can be divided in two parts: initialisation and the main loop.
Initialisation
1. Exaramel creates a UNIX socket /tmp/.applocktx. This socket is not used to communicate but only to avoid
concurrent executions of Exaramel. If the socket creation fails with an error code stating that the local
address is already in use, Exaramel halts its execution and writes to the standard output: App has already
started!
2. Exaramel sets a handler for the following signals: SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGQUIT and SIGKILL. The handler ter-
minates the Exaramel process.
3. Exaramel reads its conﬁguration ﬁle. More details about this behaviour are available in Section 2.2.2.4.
4. Exaramel checks if a persistence method is activated. If this is not the case, Exaramel tries to become per-
sistent. More details about this behaviour are available in Section 2.2.2.8.

Sandworm intrusion set campaign targeting Centreon systems
Main loop
The main loop body can be summed up in four steps:
1. Exaramel contacts its Command and Control server to get a list of tasks to execute.
2. Exaramel runs the tasks it received. Some might run in the background indeﬁnitely.
3. Exaramel contacts its Command and Control server to get the time interval it is supposed to spend suspended
without contacting the server.
4. Exaramel suspends itself until the end of the time interval.
A detailed description of this loop is presented in ﬁgure 2.9.
Fig. 2.9: Detailed execution ﬂow of Exaramel main loop.
Command line arguments
Exaramel accepts an optional command line argument. It can take two values.
• delete: Exaramel self-deletes. It uninstall its persistence, deletes its conﬁguration ﬁle and stops its execution.
• status: at the end of each main loop iteration, Exaramel prints a summary of its internal state on the
standard output.

2.2.2.4 Conﬁguration
Exaramel stores its conﬁguration in a ﬁle named configtx.json in the folder $EXARAMEL_DIR. This ﬁle is encrypted
using the RC4 algorithm and the key odhyrfjcnfkdtslt. Once decrypted, the ﬁle is in a JSON format. Its speciﬁ-
cation is given below in GO syntax.
1
Config struct {
2
// URLs server list
3
Hosts []string
4
// Proxy HTTP URL to connect to servers (optional)
5
Proxy string
6
// EXARAMEL version
7
Version string
8
// UUID, used probably to identify an Exaramel instance
9
Guid string
10
// Time span of the last run pause between two mails loop run.
11
// This field is updated before each execution pause.
12

13
// Date when EXARAMEL last paused its execution
14
Datetime string
15
// Timeout value given to HTTP/HTTPS implementation
16
Timeout int
17
// Time during which EXARAMEL paused its execution between two
18
// main loop iterations. This field is used when EXARAMEL
19
// fails to get a time interval from its control server.
20
Def int64
21
}
During the initialisation phase, Exaramel tries to read its conﬁguration ﬁle. If it fails, it uses its default conﬁguration
and creates a new conﬁguration ﬁle. The default conﬁguration is given below:
1
{
2
"Hosts":["https://$DEFAULT\_SERVER_IP/api/v1"],
3
"Proxy":"",
4
"Version":"1",
5
"Next":20,
6
"Datetime":"",
7
"Timeout":30,
8
"Def":20
9
}
When the default conﬁguration is used, the GUID ﬁeld is generated with the uuid GO package.
A the end of the main loop run, the conﬁguration is rewritten to the same ﬁle. It is deleted when Exaramel self-
deletes.
2.2.2.5 Tasks lists
• App.Delete
– Description: Exaramel self-deletes. It uninstalls the persistence, deletes its conﬁguration ﬁle and stops
itself.
– Argument: none.
• App.SetServer
– Description: adds a server URL to the conﬁguration ﬁeld Hosts. The new URL is added at the beginning
of the list

– Argument: server URL.
• App.SetProxy
– Description: sets a new value for the conﬁguration ﬁeld Proxy.
– Argument: proxy URL.
• App.SetTimeout
– Description: sets a new value for the conﬁguration ﬁeld Timeout.
– Argument: timeout in seconds.
• App.Update
– Description: downloads a ﬁle from the Command and Control server, replace the current binary with it,
runs it and halts itself.
– Argument: ﬁlename of the new Exaramel version.
• IO.ReadFile
– Description: copies a ﬁle from Exaramel host to Command and Control server.
– Argument: ﬁle path on the Exaramel host.
• IO.WriteFile
– Description: copies a ﬁle from Command and Control server to Exaramel host.
– Argument: ﬁle path on the Exaramel host.
• OS.ShellExecute
– Description: runs a shell command and sends a copy of both standard and error output to the Command
and Control server.
– Argument: shell command.
2.2.2.6 Reports
Once the task is run, Exaramel produces a report with no particular formatting rules. These reports are sent to the
Command and Control server either once the task ends or when the main loop starts again.
Most reports are saved to ﬁles before being sent to the Command and Control server. Report ﬁles are created in
the $EXARAMEL_DIR folder and are named $TASK_ID.rep where $TASK_ID is the numeric identiﬁcation of the task.
When a report is succesfully sent, the corresponding ﬁle is deleted. However, if it fails, the ﬁle is kept and Exaramel
will try to send it again at the start of each main loop run.

Exaramel does not keep internally a list of reports waiting to be sent. At the beginning of the main loop, Exaramel
tries to send reports in bulk to its Command and Control server. In order to list these ﬁles, Exaramel lists the di-
rectory $EXARAMEL_DIR and all its subdirectory recursively in order to ﬁnd report ﬁles. Exaramel considers that a
ﬁle is a report if its name contains the regular expression .rep.

2.2.2.7 Communication
Exaramel communicates with its Command and Control server using HTTPS. To do so it uses the standard library of
the GO language. Exaramel does not check the certiﬁcate exposed by the server. Data exchanged through HTTPS
are mostly formatted in JSON but not exclusively.
Exaramel tries to reach each of the server speciﬁed in the conﬁguration (Hosts ﬁeld) until it ﬁnds one that responds
to its request, without checking the HTTP status code. This server will become its Command and Control server.
Further communications will be sent only to this server.
Exaramel uses six different types of requests to communicate with its Command and Control server. They are
detailed below.
Get Authorization
It is the ﬁrst request run by Exaramel. It is used to identify an active server within the conﬁguration list. Exaramel
runs a POST request to $SERVER_URL/auth/app. The following information is sent (percent-encoded) in the body
of the POST request.
• guid: $EXARAMEL_GUID.
• whoami: result of the shell command whoami.
• platform: result of the shell command uname -a.
• version: version number (conﬁguration ﬁeld Version).
• generation: hardcoded and set to 1.
The server is expected to respond either with a RespAuth or with a RespError structure, both in JSON.
1
RespAuth struct{
2
Auth struct {
3
GUID string `json:"guid"`
4
AuthResult int `json:"auth_result"`
5
} `json:"response"`
6
}
7
8
RespError struct{
9
Error struct {
10
Code uint32 `json:"error_code"`
11
Message string `json:"error_msg"`
12
} `json:"response"`
13
}
An answer is considered positive if Auth.AuthResult is set to 1. But in practice, the server answer does not have
much impact. If the server answers, it will be chosen by Exaramel as its Command and Control server.
As described on the left part of ﬁgure 2.9, if Exaramel receives an error to any other type of request, it will try to
ﬁnd a new Command and Control server.
Send Report
In order to send a report to its Command and Control server, Exaramel uses a POST request to the url $SERVER_-
URL/tasks.report/. The body request is encoded in multipart/form-data. It contains three parts named file,
guid et task_id.
The server is expected to respond either with a Reports or with a RespError structure, both in JSON.
27/01/2021

Reports struct{
2
Response struct {
3
ID string `json:"guid"`
4
CommandID string `json:"id"`
5
Status int `json:"status"`
6
} `json:"response"`
7
}
If the answer is positive, the ﬁeld Response.Status is set to 1.
Get Tasks
in order to get new tasks from its Command and Control server, Exaramel runs a GET request to $SERVER_-
URL/tasks.get/$EXARAMEL_GUID.
The server is expected to respond either with a Tasks or with a RespError structure, both in JSON.
1
Tasks struct{
2
// Liste de tâches
3
Response []TaskResponse `json:"response"`
4
}
5
6
type TaskResponse struct{
7
// Task identification
8
ID uint32 `json:"id"`
9
// Task type, e.g. "OS.ShellExecute" or "IO.ReadFile"
10
Method string `json:"metod"`
11
// Optional argument needed for some tasks
12
Arguments string `json:"arguments"`
13
// Not used
14
Attachment int `json:"attachment"`
15
// Only for "OS.ShellExecute" task. If the field is non zero, the shell process
16
// will be run in the background.
17
AnswerWait int `json:"answer_wait"`
18
// No real impact in task processing
19
DoAsync int `json:"answer_async"`
20
// If the field is non zero, the report will be sent as soon as the task ends
21
AnswerImmediately int `json:"answer_immediately"`
22
// Max task duration. Once it is reached the task
23
// is left in the background and a report is produced.
24
WaitOutputTime int `json:"wait_output_time"`
25
}
Commentary: When a shell command runs in the background (AnswerWait == 0 or WaitOutputTime is over), data
written to standard and error outputs are lost.
Get File
In order to download a ﬁle from its Command and Control server, Exaramel runs a GET request to $SERVER_-
URL/attachment.get/EXARAMEL_GUI/$FILE_ID. The ﬁle identiﬁcation number, which is noted in this analysis
$FILE_ID, is always equal to the corresponding task identiﬁcation number.
The server is expected to respond either directly with the ﬁle in the response body, or with a JSON formated
RespError structure.

Sandworm intrusion set campaign targeting Centreon systems
Get Interval
In order to get from the Command and Control server the time interval during which it is supposed to suspend its
execution between two main loop runs, Exaramel executes a GET to $SERVER_URL/time.get/$EXARAMEL_GUID.
The server is expected to respond either with a Intervals or with a RespError structure, both in JSON.
1
type Intervals struct{
2
Response struct {
3
// Not used
4
ID string `json:"id"`
5
// This field used role is unknown
6
Timeout string `json:"online_period"`
7
// Two timestamps using the format "15:04:05" separated with a whitespace
8
PermHours string `json:"online_interval"`
9
// Day(s) of the week, crontab syntaxe
10
PermDays string `json:"online_days_of_week"`
11
// Day(s) of the month, crontab syntaxe
12
PermNumberDays string `json:"online_days"`
13
// Month, crontab syntaxe
14
PermMonths string `json:"online_months"`
15
} `json:"response"`
16
}
Most of the ﬁelds of the Intervals structure are parts of a crontab expression. The cron package mentioned before
is used to analyse this structure’s ﬁelds in order to set the date of the next communication rendez-vous.
Commentary: It is the only use of the cron package. It is not used by persistence methods.
Send Next Time
After resolving the date at which it has to contact the Command and Control server, Exaramel sends it to the server.
Exaramel runs a POST request to $SERVER_URL/time.set. The following information is sent (percent-encoded) in
the body of the POST request.
• guid: $EXARAMEL_GUID.
• next_connection: time span in seconds during which Exaramel will suspend its execution (conﬁguration
ﬁeld Next).
The server answers with either a NextTime or a RespError structure, both in JSON.
1
type NextTime struct{
2
Response struct {
3
ID string `json:"id"`
4
Status int `json:"status"`
5
} `json:"response"`
6
}
The server’s response is ignored by Exaramel.
Commentary: It can be noted that Exaramel authors probably mistook the proxy URL (Proxy conﬁguration ﬁeld) with
the server URL in this request. The server URL is used instead of the proxy URL. The Command and Control server might
never receive this request.
2.2.2.8 Persistence
When Exaramel starts, it checks if its persistence is active. If this is not the case, it scans its running environment
(running privileges and startup system) and tries to persist. The persistence is deleted when Exaramel self-deletes.
Several methods are used depending on the running environment. Theys are listed below.

Exaramel is not run by root
• Installation: Exaramel adds two entries to the user crontab, one that restarts Exaramel every minute (*/1 *
* * * ) and another one that starts Exaramel at the system start (@reboot).
• Deletion: Exaramel deletes every entries of the user’s crontab.
• Check: Exaramel searches for $EXARAMEL_PATH in the crontab entries of the user.
Commentary: This persistence method is the only one that was seen by ANSSI during this campaign.

Exaramel is run by root and the startup system is FreeBSD rc
• Installation: there is no speciﬁc installation method for this startup system. By default, the ﬁrst installation
method based on crontab is used (ﬁrst described method). However it is possible that the intrusion set uses a
second persistence methods speciﬁc to FreeBSD rc. However it is not implemented in EXARAMEL.
• Deletion: Exaramel deletes the ﬁle /etc/rc.d/syslogger/ as well as all lines of /etc/rc.conf that contains
syslogger_enable. Every crontab entries of the root user are also deleted.
• Check: Exaramel checks if the ﬁle /etc/rc.d/syslogger exists.
The content of the ﬁle /etc/rc.d/syslogger is not known.
Exaramel is run by root but the startup system is not known
The persistence method based on crontab (ﬁrst described method) is used by default.
2.2.3 Backdoor versions
Before march 2018, ANSSI identiﬁed the existence of an unencrypted conﬁguration ﬁle named config.json at the
same time of a socket ﬁle /tmp/.applock. However, the ﬁle /tmp/.applock was also found subsequently to the
presence of the ﬁle /tmp/.applocktx. At least three versions seem to exists:
Version
Activity
Persistence
Conﬁguration ﬁle encryption
Conﬁguration ﬁle encryption

1
11/2017 - 02/2018
respawner.sh and cron

yes
conﬁg.json
?
3
03/2018 - 05/2020
cron
yes

Commentary: Even if this version timeline is not entirely coherent, it does suggest several evolutions of the backdoor,
including during the intrusion.

2.3 "SetUID" binary
An additional binary was identiﬁed with SetUID functionnalities on the path /bin/backup. It offers the execution
of a list of commands with high privileges. The decompiled code is noted below.
1
int __cdecl main(int argc, const char **argv, const char **envp){
2
setuid(0) ;
3
system("/usr/share/centreon/www/include/tools/check.sh");
4
return 0;
5
}
This binary runs the content of the check.sh ﬁle as the system root user. This ﬁle can be edited by the user apache.
3 Infrastructure
ANSSI’s investigation identiﬁed two infrastructure clusters used by the intrusion set.
• Anonymisation: the intrusion set uses common VPN services in order to connect to webshells;
• Command and Control: the intrusion set uses a separate set of servers to manage C2 communications with
the malwares.
3.1 Anonymisation infrastructure
Most of the IP adresses that connected to the webshells belonged to following public or commercial anonymisation
services:
• TOR network;
• PRIVATEINTERNETACCESS (VPN) network;
• EXPRESSVPN network;
• VPNBOOK network.
Other IP adresses could not be linked to public or commercial anonymisation infrastructure.
3.2 Command and Control infrastructure
Exaramel Command and Control servers are directly contacted by the malware through their IP adresses on the
port 443 using the HTTPS protocol. They are most probably entirely controlled by the intrusion set.

5 Links with the intrusion set Sandworm
Commentary: An intrusion set is the sum of tools, tactics, technics, procedures and characteristics used by one or more
actors within one or more campaigns. It should not be confused with a threat actor which consists in peoples or organi-
sations.
The webshell P.A.S. was freely available on the developer’s website. As such, it was accessible to multiple threat
actors. Taken independantly, it is not an indicator that allows a link to an intrusion set.
Linux/Exaramel has already been analysed by ESET. They noted the similarities between this backdoor and In-
dustroyer that was used by the intrusion set TeleBots, also known as Sandworm [1]. Even if this tool can be easily
reused, the Command and Control infrastructure was known by ANSSI to be controlled by the intrusion set.
Generally speaking, the intrusion set Sandworm is known to lead consequent intrusion campaigns before focusing
on speciﬁc targets that ﬁts its strategic interests within the victims pool. The campaign observed by ANSSI ﬁts this
behaviour.

6 Recommandations
6.1 Patch applications
Applications vulnerabilities are often corrected by the editors. It is therefore recommanded to update applications
as soon as vulnerabilities are public and corrective patches are issued. This is especially imperative for critical
systems such as monitoring systems.
6.2 Limit monitoring systems external exposure
Monitoring systems such as Centreon need to be highly intertwined with the monitored information system and
therefore are a prime target for intrusion sets seeking lateralisation. It is recommanded either not to expose these
tools’ web interfaces [10] to Internet or to restrict such access using non-applicative authentication (TLS client cer-
tiﬁcate, basic authentication on the web server).
6.3 Server hardening
If a monitoring systems is exposed, it is recommended to harden the Linux server hosting these tools using the
Renforcé proﬁle of the guide RECOMMANDATIONS DE CONFIGURATION D’UN SYSTÈME GNU/LINUX [11].
It is also recommended to export web server logs and to store them for at least one year.

7.1.2 Network detection
The URL allowing to connect to the webshell is http://<IP>/centreon/search.php. It is not a classic
Centreon URL path. Valid connections to this URL can be considered malicious.
7.1.2.1 Speciﬁc value used for password detection
As detailed in the webshell decryption analysis, each request to the webshell needs to transfer the password, either
through a cookie if the user was already logged in, or through the login form. It is possible to detect a characteristic
ﬁeld used to transfer the password, as suggested by the following Snort rules.
1
alert tcp any any -> any any ( sid:2000211001; msg:"P.A.S. webshell - Password cookie"; \

7.2 Exaramel backdoor detection
7.2.1 System artefacts
List of ﬁles that might be created by Exaramel:
• $EXARAMEL_DIR/configtx.json ;
• $EXARAMEL_DIR/config.json ;
• $EXARAMEL_DIR/$TASK_ID.rep where $TASK_ID is a number;
• $EXARAMEL_PATH.old save ﬁle created during an update. It is usually wiped at the end of an update;
• /etc/systemd/system/syslogd.service;
• /etc/init/syslogd.conf;
• /etc/init.d/syslogd;
• /etc/rc.d/syslogger (this ﬁle is not directly created by Exaramel but is linked to one of its persistence
method).
List of sockets created by Exaramel:
• UNIX sockets /tmp/.applocktx and /tmp/.applock
• TCP socket for HTTPS communication to Command and Control server.
Exaramel indirectly creates system logs during its persistence setup and deletion. The system logs type depends
on the persistence method used.
Exaramel creates shell processes to run OS.ShellExecute tasks. If Task.AnswerWait is equal to 0 for one of these
tasks, the process becomes defunct when its execution ends. As a consequence, it is deleted only when the execution
of the Exaramel process has also ended.
