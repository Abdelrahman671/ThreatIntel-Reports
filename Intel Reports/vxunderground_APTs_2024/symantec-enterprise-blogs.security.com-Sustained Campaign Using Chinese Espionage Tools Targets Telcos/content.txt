Sustained Campaign Using Chinese Espionage Tools Targets
Telcos
Attackers using tools associated with Chinese espionage groups have breached multiple telecom
operators in a single Asian country in a long-running espionage campaign. The attackers placed
backdoors on the networks of targeted companies and also attempted to steal credentials. 
The attacks have been underway since at least 2021, with evidence to suggest that some of this activity
may even date as far back as 2020. Virtually all of the organizations targeted were telecoms operators,
with the addition of a services company that serves the telecoms sector and a university in another Asian
country. 
Tools used
Custom malware associated with a number of China-linked espionage actors was used in the campaign,
including:
Coolclient: A backdoor associated with the Fireant group (aka Mustang Panda, Earth Preta). Its
functionality includes logging keystrokes, reading and deleting files, and communication with a command
and control (C&C) server. Variants of the backdoor used in this campaign were similar to
one documented by Trend in 2023. A version of the legitimate VLC Media Player masquerading as a
Google file (googleupdate.exe) was used to sideload a Coolclient loader (file name: libvlc.dll). The loader
reads an encrypted payload from a file named loader.ja. This payload will in turn read a second encrypted
payload from a file named goopdate.ja and inject it into the winver.exe process.
2/5
Quickheal: A backdoor that has been long associated with the Neeedleminer group (aka RedFoxtrot,
Nomad Panda). The variant of Quickheal used in this campaign was a 32-bit DLL named RasTls.dll,
which had an export named GetOfficeDatatal.
Analysis of the malware revealed that it was almost identical to Quickheal variants documented by
Recorded Future in 2021, the only differences being new configuration details in the compiled code and
VMProtect obfuscations.
The backdoor communicated with a hardcoded C&C server named swiftandfast.net using TCP port 443.
It used a custom communications protocol that was designed to look like SSL traffic but used its own
encryption instead.
Rainyday: A backdoor associated with the Firefly group (aka Naikon). Most of the Rainyday variants
used during the campaign were executed using a loader named fspmapi.dll. The loader is sideloaded
using a legitimate F-Secure executable named fsstm.exe. When loaded, it obtains the disk folder of the
executable that started the process and sets it as the current directory. It then obtains the memory
location of the executable and patches its memory image. This appears to be done in order to hijack the
execution flow when the malware is loaded by a certain executable. If the hijack is successful, the loader
reads from a file called dataresz, decrypts the payload with a single byte XOR key (0x2D) and executes it
as shellcode.
Minor variants of the above include one with an invalid digital signature by "Kaspersky Lab" and another
whose loader reads the encrypted shellcode from a file named iReports.
Another variant is executed using a loader named security.dll. It is sideloaded using an executable called
msproxy.exe, which is an application called Proxifier, developed by Initex. The executable’s default name
is ProxyChecker.exe and was likely renamed to masquerade as a Microsoft file. In this case, the loader
reads the encrypted shellcode from a file named nod193100. The XOR key used is also different: 0xF6. 
Two files with the name nod193100 found on VirusTotal were, on analysis, found to be similar to a loader
used for the Rainyday backdoor documented by Bitdefender in 2021. 
Other TTPs
Aside from the custom backdoors mentioned above, the attackers used a variety of other tactics,
techniques, and procedures (TTPs):
Keylogging malware, possibly custom-developed
Port scanning: At least three distinct port-scanning tools were deployed
Credential theft through the dumping of registry hives
Responder: A publicly available tool that acts as a Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR)
NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS) and multicast DNS (mDNS) poisoner
Enabling RDP 
Links to Chinese Espionage Groups
3/5
Tools used in this campaign have strong associations with multiple Chinese groups and at least three of
the custom backdoors deployed are believed to be used exclusively by Chinese espionage actors.
Coolclient is tied to the Fireant group while Quickheal is associated with the Needleminer group.
Rainyday, meanwhile, has always been used by the Firefly group. All three groups are widely considered
by multiple security firms, including Symantec, to be operating from China. The United States–China
Economic and Security Review Commission, an independent advisory body established by the U.S.
Congress, has described Firefly as an "APT possibly associated with Unit 78020 (PLA) that operates in
the southern theater command’s area of responsibility (AOR)."
The nature of the link between the actors involved in the current campaign remains unclear. Possibilities
include, but are not limited to:
Attacks by multiple actors, acting independently of one another.
A single actor using tools and/or personnel acquired from or shared by other groups.
Multiple actors collaborating in a single campaign.
The ultimate motive of the intrusion campaign remains unclear. The attackers may have been gathering
intelligence on the telecoms sector in that country. Eavesdropping is another possibility. Alternatively, the
attackers may have been attempting to build a disruptive capability against critical infrastructure in that
country.
